# Welcome to Legend
This book contains all you will need for adventuring in worlds of sword and sorcery, where a good
blade is all that stands between you and certain doom. The rules presented in this volume can be
tailored to a wide variety of settings and genres although the focus is primarily on gritty fantasy
with a heroic feel. These rules are not confined to just one world: the rules are characterised by
flexibility and intuition, permitting Games Masters, players and their Adventurers to explore just
about any milieu they care to. The game focuses on characters and their capabilities, grounding
everything from an adventuring perspective. Using Legend as the basis, many different settings
and worlds are possible - all it takes is imagination.


## New to Roleplaying?
Although Legend is by no means an overly complex game, it is assumed that those reading
this book have played a roleplaying game before and understand the key concepts: players
control characters and a Referee or Games Master articulates the story and the action, as well
as adjudicating the results. So, whilst advice for both players and Games Masters is included
throughout these rules, in the form of examples, clearly explained rules and so forth, it is written
from the standpoint of a certain degree of roleplaying familiarity and experience.


## New to Legend?
The Legend rules are part of a family of popular percentile-based systems that are renowned
for their ease of use and adaptability. Legend’s concepts and rules are easy to understand and
implement with a series of unified mechanics underpinning the separate elements of character
creation, combat and magic. Most character actions are based around a percentile skill or
ability with a roll equal to, or below, the value indicating success. Of course different rules and
circumstances add a certain degree of sophistication and complexity but at its heart Legend is a
very simple, logical system that can be grasped from a glance at the character sheet and a scan
through these rules.

The game’s design also incorporates new thinking that complements many tried and tested
mechanics. This approach offers players a vast degree of control over what their characters do and
how they do it. Many of the choices and possibilities are subtle: players and Games Masters will find
that, with a little thought and creativity, all manner of wonderful opportunities and complexities
present themselves whilst still being supported by the rules framework. Legend is completely
adaptable and its intuitive rules mean that creating new rules or changing existing ones, whether to
support an individual style of play or a particular setting, is easy to do and accommodate.


## Forge your own Legend
These rules offer a detailed roleplaying framework and most players and Games Masters will
use them as presented. However, nothing is cast in stone. If a rule does not suit you, change
it or ignore it. Your game is paramount. It is impossible, when designing a game, to take
into account every situation, notion or idea that will present itself during play. However, the
framework is here to support informed decision making and to allow you to make Legend your
own, unique rules set.

Experiment, improvise and adapt - that is the Legend way!


## The Rules
The next chapter begins the Legend rules with Adventurer Creation, with each chapter
introducing new concepts and themes. Read through each chapter, returning to it as necessary
to clarify your understanding and referring to others as directed. Reference to future chapters
is necessary but has been minimised as far as possible. However, it will be necessary to cross-
reference certain rules to establish their full impact and reach.

Throughout the book we have provided certain optional rules, which are presented in
text boxes. These options provide a different slant or take on the core rules, allowing
Games Masters to tailor the rules to the game. As with any option, the choice is for you
to make; or, as already mentioned, develop your own options that fit how your Legend
should develop.


## What Else Do I Need?
Legend is self-contained: with just this book you have everything needed to create thrilling
characters, adventures and quests. However additional Legend volumes, expanding on these core
rules, may prove useful at a later stage - but are by no means essential to enjoying the game.

You are also directed to the Mongoose website for additional downloads, such as an Adventurer
sheet and notes for converting RuneQuest II material to work with Legend.


# Adventurer Creation

Legend characters are called Adventurers and this chapter explains how they are created. Every
player in Legend creates and controls at least one Adventurer and it is through their Adventurer
that players explore the game world around them. Adventurers, as their name suggests, are
the common populace shy away from. Adventurers in Legend are heroes in the making; the ones
seeking adventure, glory and heroism; they are prepared to engage in feats and endeavours that
who, in time, might become the subjects of stories, legends and myths of their own.


## Adventurer Overview
Every Adventurer is comprised of certain game statistics that describe the character and what he
is capable of. These statistics are as follows:

**Characteristics** - Seven Characteristics define an Adventurer: Strength, Constitution, Size,
Intelligence, Power, Dexterity and Charisma. These are physical and mental attributes that
define how strong, resilient, large, clever, quick and charismatic the Adventurer is. From these
seven Characteristics all other game statistics flow.

**Attributes** - Derived from the seven Characteristics, Attributes are secondary statistics that
provide modifiers for certain actions or determine particular capabilities. Each is described in
more detail later in this chapter but the attributes are: Combat Actions, Damage Modifiers,
Improvement Roll Modifiers, Hit Points, Magic Points, Strike Rank and Movement.

**Skills** - Skills are the engine room of a Legend Adventurer. Skills are particular talents, abilities,
capabilities and professional skills that are shaped by an Adventurer’s culture, the profession he
has chosen for himself and the way he has chosen to develop his interests and competencies.
Skills are divided into Common and Advanced; Common skills are common to all Adventurers.
Advanced skills differ from one Adventurer to another, reflecting culture, profession and
individual interests. However all skills work in the same way and have starting values derived
from a combination, or multiple, of the seven Characteristics.

**Community** - No man is an island. Even before your Adventurer has set forth on his career
as a potential hero, he has been supported by family, friends and allies. He may also have
made valuable contacts, gained a few rivals and perhaps even some enemies. An Adventurer’s
Community is a summary of those people he knows and may be able to call upon in the future
- or who may call upon him.

**Magic, Weapons, Equipment** and so on - In addition to these game statistics every
Adventurer has additional information relating to what magic they know (if any), weapons
they are experienced in using, equipment they carry and other pertinent information about the
Adventurer in the here and now. These elements are introduced at the appropriate points in the
Adventurer Creation process and later in this book.

There is a sample Legend Adventurer sheet on page 36. It has sections for all the information
described here, and more, and is used during play as a record of your Adventurer’s current
status. Various statistics - skills, for example, and Hit Points - will change frequently during
the game, so complete the Adventurer sheet in pencil and keep an eraser handy to make
changes as they occur.

Permission is granted to make copies of the Legend Adventurer Sheet for personal use. A
downloadable copy can be found at www.mongoosepublishing.com.


## Characteristics
Every Adventurer, creature, monster and Non-Player Character in Legend is defined by the
same seven Characteristics. These are the building blocks for every other aspect of a Legend
Adventurer, describing their physical, mental and spiritual status. The higher the figure, for
a Characteristic, the better. Low scores in Characteristics tend to mean weakness or ill-health
- although much depends on the race that the Characteristics describe; some races have a low
statistical range simply due to their natural physiology so a low score in a Characteristic might
indicate a perfectly normal state of existence. A dwarf, for example, is always likely to have a
lower SIZ than a human.

For your first Adventurer it is recommended that you create a human. Other races are available
and because all creatures in Legend are defined in the same way, it means that just about any race
or creature type can be created as an Adventurer. Humans, however, are the easiest to understand
and the wisest choice for a new Adventurer. Human Characteristics range between 3 and 21
although the upper limit for a starting Adventurer is likely to be 18.

The Characteristics, and their abbreviations, are as follows:

#### Strength (STR)
Strength is a measure of an Adventurer’s raw muscle power. It acts as an indicator of how much
someone can lift, push or pull, or how tightly he grasps something. Strength determines if
an Adventurer can wield the heaviest hand weapons at full ability. It is also a component in
calculating the Damage Modifier, which may increase the effect of physical attacks. Human STR
cannot naturally exceed 21. If an Adventurer is reduced to zero Strength for any reason he lacks
the ability to move and becomes bed-ridden until STR improves somehow (through natural
healing or magic, for example).

#### Constitution (CON)
Constitution measures the health and vitality of an Adventurer and helps to determine how
much physical damage he can sustain. Adventurers with a high CON are likely to have more Hit
Points meaning that they can soak-up more damage during combat. CON also determines how
long it takes before an Adventurer starts to feel the effects of fatigue and weariness. Human CON
cannot naturally exceed 21. If CON is reduced to zero the Adventurer dies.

#### Size (SIZ)
Size represents the average of an Adventurer’s mass. SIZ determines if an Adventurer can see over
something, or fit through a small opening. SIZ also helps calculate the Adventurer’s Hit Points
and damage bonus. Human SIZ cannot naturally be higher than 21. If SIZ is reduced to zero it
results in death.

#### Intelligence (INT)
INT represents an Adventurer’s capacity for learning, rationalising and analysis. It is less a
measure of cleverness and more how the Adventurer applies what he knows either practically or
analytically. INT affects many other game statistics and is important if the Adventurer is to be a
competent magician. Human INT cannot naturally exceed 21. If, somehow, INT reaches zero,
then the Adventurer is reduced to a witless, drooling idiot until INT is restored in some form.

INT is also used as a bonus when rolling to improve skills. See the Skills chapter for more
information.

#### Power (POW)
A somewhat abstract Characteristic, POW represents the force of both an Adventurer’s soul and
his innate magical and spiritual presence. The more Power an Adventurer has, the greater their
force of will, confidence and capacity for magic. Human POW cannot naturally exceed 21.
POW can also be pledged to show devotion to the gods and in exchange for certain divine gifts
or benefits. If POW is reduced to zero, the Adventurer usually dies - either completely sapped of
his soul or his spirit has been taken into the gods’ care. However, depending on circumstances,
Adventurer can exist with zero POW - but may have ceased to be human altogether.

#### Dexterity (DEX)
A measure of physical co-ordination, agility, suppleness and nimbleness, DEX is an important
component in many physical skills. A decent DEX represents someone who is quick, keen of
eye and fleet of movement. DEX determines how often in a fight an Adventurer can strike or
defend himself - an important consideration if he is outnumbered or the skill of his foes is
perhaps greater than his own. Human DEX cannot naturally exceed 21. If it is reduced to zero,
the Adventurer is paralysed completely and cannot move in any way until DEX is recovered in
some way (through healing or magic, for instance).

#### Charisma (CHA)
Charisma measures the force of personality. Adventurers with a high CHA have the ability to
make friends easily, find themselves the focus of attention when it is needed (and sometimes
when not) and persuade others to do things. Adventurers with a low CHA tend not to be noticed
so readily or have a hard time making themselves heard. Charisma is not a measure of how
beautiful or handsome an Adventurer is; it is, instead, an indicator of confidence and the ability
to express one’s self. Human CHA has no upper limit although it is rare for it to exceed 21. If
reduced to zero in any way, then the Adventurer has become completely uncommunicative and
emotionless - a shell of a person.

CHA also influences the number of Improvement Rolls the Adventurer has when opportunities
for skill and Characteristic improvements come around.


### Determining Characteristics
An Adventurer’s Characteristics can be determined in one of several ways. The Games Master
will decide which method is to be used.

#### Random Roll, In Order
Roll 3D6 for STR, CON, POW, DEX and CHA taking each dice roll result as it comes. For
INT and SIZ roll 2D6+6 again, taking the rolled results.

#### Random Roll, Assign
Roll 3D6 five times and choose which result will be allocated to which Characteristic from STR,
CON, POW, DEX and CHA. Next, roll 2D6+6 twice and decide which score with be allocated
to INT and which to SIZ.

#### Characteristic Values - Optional Rule
In both Random Roll options Games Masters may wish to allow one, or both, of the following
options:

* Re-roll any result of 6 or less.
* Allow the player to take up to two points from one Characteristic and assign them to
another. This swap may only be done once and neither SIZ nor INT can benefit from the
swap. Furthermore, no Characteristic can be allowed to fall below 3 or exceed 18.

#### Points Build
Some players prefer not to roll dice to determine the Characteristics for their Adventurer, either
because they do not like leaving their Adventurer to chance or because they have a certain
Adventurer type and certain Characteristic values in mind. This option allows the players to
design their Adventurer by assigning a number of points to their Characteristics from a pool of
Characteristic Design Points.

* Players have 80 Characteristic Design Points.
* 1 point in a Characteristic costs 1 Design Point.
* Characteristics cannot be lower than 6 or greater than 18.
* All Characteristic Design Points must be used in the design process. Points cannot be
  held over or used for anything else.

Using the Points Build system, some players may want to design an Adventurer with
Characteristics that exceed 18 and may go as high as 21. Games Masters may allow this as an
option but if so, every Characteristic point above 18 costs 2 Characteristic Design Points to buy.
So, if a player wanted to have an Adventurer with STR 20, it would cost 22 Design Points: 18
points for STR 18 and then a further 4 points to raise STR 18 to STR 20.


## Attributes
Attributes are a series of game statistics that are derived from the Adventurer’s Characteristic
scores. Attributes represent capabilities that the Adventurer draws upon during the game to help
resolve certain actions and outcomes. The attributes are as follows:

> Alaric the Brave - An Example Adventurer
> Throughout Legend we will follow the progress of Alaric the Brave: from initial dice rolls right
> through to his first few adventures. We begin at the beginning: with a blank Adventurer sheet, a pencil
> and some dice.
> 
> The Games Master has decided that Adventurers in his campaign will be rolled using the Random
> Assign method. Alaric’s player must therefore roll 3D6 five times, noting the results, and 2D6+6 twice,
> again, noting the outcomes.
> 
> For the 3D6 rolls he gets the following: 10, 12, 13, 7 and 14. For the two 2D6+6 rolls he gets 16 and 14.
> 
> Alaric’s player decides to allocate the results as follows: STR 12, CON 7, SIZ 14, INT 16, POW 14, DEX 13, CHA 10.
> 
> Alaric is around the human average for Strength. He is no weight-lifter but neither is he a weakling.
> With CON 7, Alaric most likely suffers from coughs, sneezes and winter chills. He might have suffered
> an illness as a young child that has left his body weakened, or suffered some childhood injury that
> did not heal properly. SIZ 14 indicates Alaric is above average height. He stands taller than the other
> boys in his village and is stockier maybe. With INT 16 - Alaric is smart. He is observant, good at
> committing things to memory and has the ability to analyse problems and solve them quickly. His
> POW of 14 means his spirit is strong; with an above average Power score he will find working magic
> easier and will be noticeable to the gods who watch over his village. Alaric’s DEX 13 is above average,
> so he is pretty agile and fast. He is noted for accuracy in various village games, such as horseshoe
> throwing. Finally, CHA 10 is about average: Alaric is personable but not especially so. People know
> who Alaric is but he does not stand out from the crowd.


### Age

Legend Adventurers start the game at 16+1D4 years of age, so between the ages of 17 and 20.
Their life experiences are most likely confined to the communities of their births and they
have yet to experience the wider world. It is permissible for Adventurers to be older and
more experienced than the novices the Adventurer Creation rules generate, and the rules for
Experienced Adventurers are given on page 25 towards the end of this chapter. It is up to the
Games Master to decide if players start the game with more experienced Adventurers or not.


> Alaric’s Tale
> Rolling 1D4 and adding the result to 16 we find that Alaric begins the game at 20 years of age.


### Combat Actions
Adventurers frequently get into fights - from bar-room brawls, through duels of honour, to
tense melees with vile monsters and up to pitched battles in the midst of a war surrounded by
thousands of comrades.

Combat Actions, abbreviated to CA, are the number of times that an Adventurer can act to
either attack an enemy, defend himself from attack or perform some other action during battle.

The number of CA an Adventurer has during a Combat Round (a period of time explained later
in this book) is dependent on his DEX and INT. Add together DEX and INT and divide the
result by 2 (rounding up); then consult the Combat Actions table.

##### Combat Actions

| Average of DEX and INT                                           | Combat Actions |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 6 or less                                                        | 1              |
| 7-12                                                             | 2              |
| 13-18                                                            | 3              |
| For every additional 6 points                                    | +1             |


> Alaric’s Tale
> Alaric’s DEX of 13 and INT of 16, added together and divided by 2, gives him 3 CA. In a fight, Alaric
> is going to be confident and fast enough to act several times - an advantage over slower opponents.


### Damage Modifier
Bigger and stronger Adventurers are able to hit harder than smaller, weaker ones. The Damage
Modifier is a dice roll that is made in addition to the damage rolled for a weapon. For example,
an Adventurer with a Damage Modifier of +1D4 rolls a four-sided dice alongside the damage for the
sword he is using and adds it to the total.

To calculate the Adventurer’s Damage Modifier, add together the scores for STR and SIZ and
look up the result on the Damage Modifier table.

##### Damage Modifier

| STR + SIZ                                               | Damage Modifier |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1-5                                                     | -1D8            |
| 6-10                                                    | -1D6            |
| 11-15                                                   | -1D4            |
| 16-20                                                   | -1D2            |
| 21-25                                                   | +0              |
| 26-30                                                   | +1D2            |
| 31-35                                                   | +1D4            |
| 36-40                                                   | +1D6            |
| 41-45                                                   | +1D8            |
| 46-50                                                   | +1D10           |
| 51-60                                                   | +1D12           |
| 61-70                                                   | +2D6            |
| 71-80                                                   | +2D8            |
| 81-90                                                   | +2D10           |
| 91-100                                                  | +2D12           |

Note that the Damage Modifier can be negative. If an Adventurer is physically small and weak
he may not have the strength, leverage and reach to swing a weapon and strike to its full damage
potential. Hence, a negative Damage Modifier is still rolled but the result is subtracted from the
weapon’s damage total. If the Damage Modifier reduces a weapon’s damage to zero or a negative
number, then no damage has been inflicted on that occasion.


> Alaric’s Tale
> Alaric’s STR 12 and SIZ 14 equal 26, which gives him +1D2 as a Damage Modifier. His above-
> average SIZ means that Alaric can gain more leverage when swinging with a weapon, or place more
> weight behind it when thrusting, which improves its damage.


### Hit Points
In Legend the body of every creature - human, animal and monster - is divided into a number
of Hit Locations: each Hit Location has a number of Hit Points. Whenever a weapon strikes or
a wound is taken, the place where it hits or where the wound affects is determined and damage
applied to the Hit Points for that location.

Humans have seven Hit Locations: Head, Chest, Abdomen, Right Arm, Left Arm, Right Leg
and Left Leg. The number of Hit Points each Hit Location has is based on CON and SIZ. Add
the Adventurer’s CON and SIZ scores together and cross reference the result on the Hit Points
per Location table.

##### Hit Points per Location

**CON + SIZ**

| Location    | 1-5  | 6-10  | 11-15   | 16-20   | 21-25    | 26-30    | 31-35    | 36-40   | +5 |
|-------------|------|-------|---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|---------|----|
| Each Leg    | 1    | 2     | 3       | 4       | 5        | 6        | 7        | 8       | +1 |
| Abdomen     | 2    | 3     | 4       | 5       | 6        | 7        | 8        | 9       | +1 |
| Chest       | 3    | 4     | 5       | 6       | 7        | 8        | 9        | 10      | +1 |
| Each Arm    | 1    | 1     | 2       | 3       | 4        | 5        | 6        | 7       | +1 |
| Head        | 1    | 2     | 3       | 4       | 5        | 6        | 7        | 8       | +1 |


> Alaric’s Tale
> With a CON of 7 and SIZ of 14 we know that Alaric is big but not necessarily in the best of shape.
> CON+SIZ gives a result of 21 which, cross referenced on the Hit Points per Location table gives the
> following Hit Points per location: Right and Left Leg: 5; Abdomen: 6; Chest: 7; Right and Left Arm:
> 4; and Head: 5
> 
> Alaric’s bulk and body mass helps compensate for his somewhat flimsy constitution and Alaric has
> reasonable Hit Point scores in each location.


### Improvement Roll Modifier
At the end of a Legend story, Adventurers are given the opportunity to improve their Adventurer’s
skills and Characteristics.

The CHA score provides either a penalty or a bonus to the number of Improvement Rolls an
Adventurer has (see Adventurer Advancement starting on page 68); this reflects the relationship
that the Adventurer has with his community, peers and colleagues, or, if CHA is particularly
low, the difficulty of attempting to improve one’s capabilities without the assistance of others.

##### Improvement Roll Modifier

| CHA                                                    | Improvement Roll Modifier |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 6 or less                                              | -1                        |
| 7 - 12                                                 | 0                         |
| 13 - 18                                                | +1                        |
| For every additional 6 points of CHA                   | +1                        |


> Alaric’s Tale
> Alaric’s CHA of 10 means that he gains no Improvement Roll modifier when it comes to improving
> his skills and Characteristics; thus, if the Games Master allocates three Improvement Rolls to the
> Adventurers, Alaric takes advantage of all three. Had his CHA been higher though - say 15 - he
> would gain an additional Improvement Roll. Conversely, if his CHA was 6 or less, he would have one
> roll fewer than the number granted by the Games Master.


### Magic Points
Magic Points represent a pool of points that are used to fuel spells and other magical effects.
Usually the Magic Point total is equal to the Adventurer’s POW but this can change depending
on whether or not an Adventurer has dedicated any of his POW to the worship of a god. This is
explained in more detail later in the book, so, for now, Magic Points are equal to the Adventurer’s
POW Characteristic.

Expended Magic Points normally recover after a sufficient period of rest.

> Alaric’s Tale
> With POW 14 Alaric has 14 Magic Points. Alaric is interested in becoming active in one of the
> religions of his community and will, in the future, dedicate some of his POW to his god to show his
> devotion and this will reduce his available Magic Points but, for now, his Magic Points are the same
> as his POW.


### Movement
Human Adventurers have a base Movement rate of eight metres per Combat Round. Movement
is described in more detail in the Game System chapter.


### Strike Rank
How frequently an Adventurer acts in combat is defined by Combat Actions. How quickly he
acts is defined by Strike Rank. Strike Rank is described in more detail in the Combat chapter
but essentially, the higher an Adventurer’s Strike Rank the quicker he acts in a Combat Round.

Strike Rank is based on two components and is calculated as follows:

* Add together INT and DEX and divide the result by two (rounding up). An Adventurer’s
  speed of action is a combination ability to weigh-up his opponents and spot potential
  openings and opportunities, and his overall speed and quickness of action.

* Subtract the Strike Rank penalty incurred through wearing armour. This is described in
  more detail on page 125 but Adventurers who are wearing armour of any kind tend to have
  their movements restricted and have to handle the additional weight of their protection; this
  slows down the ability to react in a combat situation. The Strike Rank penalty for armour is
  the total amount of Armour Points the Adventurer is carrying, divided by 5 (rounded up).

Natural armour - such as a dragon’s scales - does not inflict a Strike Rank penalty. Similarly,
armour provided by some magic spells does not inflict a Strike Rank penalty either.


> Alaric’s Tale
> Taking Alaric’s INT of 16 and DEX of 13, adding them together and dividing by two gives him a
> Strike Rank of 15 (16+13 = 29/2 = 14.5, rounded up to 15).
> 
> Alaric has also inherited his grandfather’s leather jerkin, which covers his chest and abdomen and
> gives 2 Armour Points of protection to both Hit Locations. This means Alaric is carrying 4 points of
> armour and suffers a Strike Rank penalty because of it. 4 divided by 5 gives a result of 0.8 which is
> rounded up to 1. Alaric’s Strike Rank of 15 is therefore reduced to 14, reflecting the encumbrance of
> the leather armour.


## Common Skills
Every Adventurer has a range of Common skills allowing him to perform a variety of actions
with varying degrees of expertise. These are detailed more fully in the Skills chapter. At this point
of Adventurer creation, players will only need to know the base values of each Common skill.

The basic score of each Common skill is determined by the sum of two Characteristics or a
multiple of a single Characteristic. The value represents the Adventurer’s innate competence in a
given area, along with any training he has received as part of his formative years.

The Common Skills table shows how the basic values are calculated. The score represents the
percentage chance of success for a skill; so, an Athletics score of 25 is expressed as 25%. How
skill percentages work, and each Common Skill’s full description, is given in the Skills chapter.

Every Adventurer possesses the skills listed in the Common Skills table; however there are three
other categories of skills that, whilst considered to be Common, are not automatically listed.

Close Combat styles and Ranged Combat styles are special skills for using weapons. Instead
of having a single Close Combat or Ranged Combat skill, an Adventurer possesses a number
of different Close Combat Styles for different combinations of weapons. For example, one
Adventurer might be much more adept at using a Sword and Shield Close Combat Style than
she is at wielding two shortswords. All Close Combat and Ranged Combat Styles start at the
basic percentages listed in the following table but are tracked separately and do not automatically
appear in the Common Skills section of the Legend Adventurer Sheet.

| Unarmed                                    | STR+DEX          |

The existence of Common Magic in a game is up to the Games Master. In a high-fantasy setting,
then every Adventurer may know a few useful spells. In a grittier, lower-magic game, then only
those who have studied a form of magic can cast spells. Ask your Games Master if Common
Magic is available in your game; if it is, it starts at the basic percentage listed.

| Skills                                                  | Basic Percentage |
|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Each Close Combat style                                 | STR+DEX          |
| Each Ranged Combat style                                | DEX x2           |
| Common Magic                                            | POW+CHA          |


> Alaric’s Tale
> Alaric’s player checks with the Games Master and learns that Common Magic is available to everyone
> in the setting. Alaric’s basic scores in each of the Common skills are therefore as follows:
> 
> Athletics 25%,Brawn 26%, Common Magic 24%, Culture (Own) 32%, Dance 23%, Driving
> 27%, Evade 26%, Evaluate 26%, First Aid 29%, Influence 20%, Insight 30%, Lore (Regional)
> 32%, Perception 30%, Persistence 28%, Ranged Combat 26%, Resilience 14%, Ride 27%, Sing
> 24%, Sleight 23%, Stealth 29%, Swim 19%, Unarmed 25%.
> 
> Bear in mind that these are Alaric’s starting skill values reflecting his natural abilities and competencies:
> many of these areas will improve as the Adventurer Creation process continues.


## Previous Experience
The next stage of creating an Adventurer is to determine their Adventurer’s previous
experience. Each Adventurer starts the game between the ages of 17 and 20, and were most
likely considered an adult at age 14 or 15, depending on the culture. Therefore the Adventurer
has already had many years-worth of learning and experience that needs to be reflected in his
skills: this includes skills developed within the Adventurer’s culture and those skills developed
as part of professional training.

Previous experience therefore has three steps. First the player must pick the Adventurer’s Cultural
Background, which is a reflection of the kind of cultural upbringing the Adventurer has had.
This provides certain starting skill bonuses reflecting this upbringing.

Second, the player must pick a Profession and gain further skills and skill bonuses associated
with that profession. The list of professions provided is considered appropriate to an Adventurer,
however, it is entirely possible that an Adventurer might be a tailor, rather than a sailor and the
appropriate skills for that kind of profession will have to be determined between the player and
Games Master.

Third, the player determines and allocates the Adventurer’s Free Skill Points. These represent
the remainder of the Adventurer’s experience outside of his upbringing and profession.


### Cultural Background
Legend Adventurers come from one of four cultural backgrounds:

* Barbarian
* Civilised
* Nomad
* Primitive

Players are free to choose which Cultural Background their Adventurer belongs to, although
Games Masters may insist that all Adventurers in a group come from the same one. This helps
bring a group of Adventurers together, provides opportunities for friendships and community
support to develop and provides a strong reason to explain why these individuals have come
together. However it is not uncommon for Adventurers in the same group to come from very
different Cultural Backgrounds and, where this is the case, a good variety of skills and magic
gives the adventuring group flexibility and interest.

A description of each Cultural Background follows and includes a view of the culture from the
perspective of one of its members. Included in the description is a list of skill bonuses and new
skills appropriate to that culture.

Players should apply the skill bonuses immediately to the Common skills on their Adventurer
Sheet and add the additional new skills, known as Advanced Skills, to the appropriate section of
the sheet. In many cases a Cultural Background lists a range of skills and invites the player to pick
one, or more, that will gain a bonus: in this way players from the same Cultural Background can
ensure that their Adventurers are different in the areas they have developed.


#### Barbarian
Tribal in nature, barbarians tend to shun civilisation, viewing those who live in towns and cities
as weak and corrupt. They are much closer to nature and live as one with the land, hunting
and tending to their farms far out in the wilderness. Most are adept in the use of weaponry as
they must face many dangers throughout their lives. Many have extensive boating or animal
handling/riding skills.

| Common Skill Bonuses | Combat Styles | Advanced Skills | Starting Money |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| All barbarian Adventurers gain the following bonuses: +30% to Culture (Own) and Lore (Regional) +10% to Athletics and Resilience +5% to Brawn, Perception, Ride and Stealth | Barbarian Adventurers choose three Combat Styles from the following, and gain a +10% bonus to each: 2H Axe, 2H Hammer, 2H Spear, Axe and Shield, Blowgun, Bow, Dagger, Hammer and Shield, Sling, Spear and Shield, Staff, 1H Sword, Sword and Shield, Unarmed | All barbarian Adventurers gain the following Advanced Skills: Language (Native) +50% Survival In addition, barbarians choose one Advanced Skill from the following: Craft (any), Lore (any), Play Instrument, Track | Barbarians begin the game with 4D6 x20 Silver Pieces. |


#### Civilised
Civilised Adventurers hail from an urban culture, which includes a village, town or city that is
part of a wider network of similar settlements. In a civilised culture, education is becoming a
right, not a privilege and the skills of the civilised Adventurer reflect this. However, he may be
lacking in some of the skills that Adventurers from other backgrounds will depend upon for
survival in a harsh world.

| Common Skill Bonuses | Combat Styles | Advanced Skills | Starting Money |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| All civilised Adventurers gain the following bonuses: +30% to Culture (Own) and Lore (Regional) +20% to Evaluate and Influence | Civilised Adventurers choose one Combat Style from the following and gain a +10% bonus: 2H Spear, 2H Sword, Bow, Crossbow, Dagger, Polearm, Rapier, Spear and Shield, Spear, Sword and Shield | All civilised Adventurers gain the following Advanced Skills: Courtesy Language (Native) +50% In addition, civilised Adventurers choose three Advanced Skills from the following: Art (any), Craft (any), Language (any), Lore (any), Mechanisms, Play Instrument, Streetwise | Civilised Adventurers begin the game with 4D6 x75 Silver Pieces |


#### Nomad
Nomadic people are constantly on the move, with no home and hearth to call their own. They
may move aimlessly about, or they may have several camps they move to and from throughout
the year. With no crops and few herd animals of their own, nomads are adept at surviving on
what they can quickly and easily scavenge from the land.

| Common Skill Bonuses | Combat Styles | Advanced Skills | Starting Money |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| All nomad Adventurers gain the following bonuses: +10% to Athletics, Perception, Resilience and Stealth +30% to Culture (Own) and Lore (Regional) +10% to ONE of either Brawn, Drive, Ride or Swim | Nomad Adventurers choose two Combat Styles from the following and gain a +10% bonus to each: 2H Axe, 2H Hammer, 2H Spear, Axe and Shield, Blowgun, Bow, Dagger, Hammer and Shield, Sling, Spear and Shield, Spear. | All nomad Adventurers gain the following Advanced Skills: Language (Native) +50% Survival In addition, nomad Adventurers choose one Advanced Skill from the following: Boating, Craft (any), Language (any), Lore (any), Play Instrument, Track | Nomad Adventurers begin the game with 4D6 x20 Silver Pieces |


#### Primitive
People of other cultures commonly dismiss primitive people as little more than animals. While
mostly prejudice, it is true that primitive peoples have not mastered the technology that so many
other cultures take for granted, as they still rely on flint spears and arrows and they are highly
skilled at the basic knowledge needed for survival in the wild.

| Common Skill Bonuses | Combat Styles | Advanced Skills | Starting Money |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| All primitive Adventurers gain the following bonuses: +15% to Athletics, Perception, Resilience and Stealth +30% to Culture (Own) and Lore (Regional) | Primitive Adventurers choose one Combat Style from the following and gain a +10% bonus. 1H Axe, 1H Hammer, 1H Spear, 2H Hammer, Blowgun, Bow, Dagger, Sling, Spear and Shield | All primitive Adventurers gain the following Advanced Skills: Language (Native) +50% Survival Track | Primitive Adventurers begin the game with 4D6 x10 Silver Pieces. |


> Alaric’s Tale
> The campaign Alaric will be joining is set in a fantasy setting of the Game Master’s creation, called the
> Bleak Isle. The Games Master advises the players that he would like all the Adventurers to come from
> the same Cultural Background but that they can choose which background that will be. After some
> discussion the players decide that they will all play members of the same clan living in the area of the
> Bleak Isle known as the Gloamwood. This means that either Barbarian or Nomad would be a good
> fit for the region and the players settle on Barbarian. Alaric’s player enters this on his Adventurer sheet.
> 
> Running through the skill bonuses and options, Alaric’s adjusted Common skills now look like this:
> 
> Athletics 35% Brawn 31% Culture (Own) 62%, Lore (Regional) 62%, Perception 35%, Resilience
> 24%, Ride 32%, Stealth 34%.
> 
> Alaric also gets to choose three Combat Styles gaining a +10% bonus to each. He chooses Spear and
> Shield, Dagger and Sling. Spear and Shield, and Dagger, are both Close Combat styles, whilst Sling
> is a Ranged Combat style. His Close Combat skills start at STR+DEX, which for Alaric is 25%,
> and Ranged Combat skills start at DEX x2, which is 26%. With his barbarian 10% bonus Alaric’s
> weapon skills are therefore Spear and Shield 35%, Dagger 35%, Sling 36%.
> 
> Alaric also gains three Advanced Skills. These need to be written onto his Adventurer Sheet as Advanced
> Skills vary from one character to another and are therefore not listed. He gains Language (Native) at
> its starting value and a +50% bonus; he also gains Survival at its starting percentage. Additionally
> he must choose one particular Advanced Skill from the Barbarian Cultural Background list: Alaric
> goes for Lore (The Thunderer). He knows that there are Thunder Worshippers in the setting and the
> idea of worshipping a storm god intrigues him. The Games Master agrees that this is a good choice of
> Advanced Skill and it is entered into his Adventurer Sheet along with the others.
> 
> Alaric checks on the Basic Values for his Advanced Skills and notes down the percentages. These are:
> Language (Native) (INT+CHA) 26%+50% = 76%; Survival (POW+CON) = 21%; Lore (The
> Thunderer) (INT x2) = 32%


### Professions
Every Legend Adventurer starts the game having followed a profession. The profession he chooses
may not necessarily be the one he continues to follow as he begins his adventuring life but it is
the career he embarked on as part of the transition to adulthood and it further defines his skill
development. The professions available are dependent on the Cultural Background; in some
cultures the list of available professions is quite narrow because the needs of the community are
straightforward and cultural traditions will push young adults along a certain path. In others,
the list is more diverse, reflecting a more complex community and society with wider needs or
cultural traditions that have diversified over the centuries.

Players should therefore examine the list of professions available to them based on the cultural
background chosen in the previous stage of Previous Experience. Like the cultural background
the profession offers bonuses to Common Skills and access to new Advanced Skills. These are
applied to the Adventurer Sheet immediately.

Some professions also introduce Magical Skills. These Magical Skills are described in the Skills
chapter, beginning on page 38.

If a profession duplicates an Advanced Skill gained through the cultural background (or the skill
is offered as an Advanced Skill option and the player chooses it again) then the Adventurer gains
a +10% bonus to it.

Free Skill Points
Every Legend Adventurer receives an additional 250 Skill Points to spend on their Adventurer.
The player can add these Free Skill Points to his skills in the following ways:

* Add to a Common skill or Combat Style skill score.
* Add to an Advanced skill score, as long as the Adventurer already possesses the skill.
* Buy an Advanced skill. This costs 10 Free Skill Points and the Advanced skill starts at its
  basic Characteristic-derived score.
* Buy skills enabling Magic to be cast. If Common Magic is supported in the Legend setting
  , then the Adventurer will already have this as a Common skill; otherwise it will need to
  be bought as an Advanced Skill. The other magic enabling skills are Pact (Deity) and Lore
  (Specific Theology) - for Divine cult members or Manipulation and Sorcery (Grimoire)
  for Sorcerers.

Important Note: No single skill can benefit from more than 30 Free Skill Points. This means
that an Advanced skill purchased with Free Skill Points cannot be increased by more than 20
points.

> For example, if Alaric, as part of his Free Skill Points, chose to buy Tracking (an Advanced Skill),
> it would cost 10 Skill Points to buy the skill at its basic, Characteristic value - in this case Alaric’s
> INT+CON, making it 23% - and Alaric would not be able to spend more than an additional 20
> points on it meaning that, if he chose to raise it, the maximum it could be would be 43%.

> Alaric’s Tale
> 
> Coming from a barbarian culture, Alaric has a whole range of professions
> to choose from. Running through the list the one that appeals most is Warrior.
> Alaric’s player reasons that because Alaric is big and reasonably clever, his size and
> smarts will give him an advantage in combat. He also decides that his father
> was a warrior too and, in a barbarian culture, it is a case of Like Father,
> Like Son.
> 
> Choosing Warrior as his profession, Alaric gains +5% to Athletics,
> Brawn, Evade and Resilience. He also gains +10% to any two
> Combat Styles and, because he already has Spear and Shield and
> Dagger, he decides that he will improve these two Combat Styles.
> For his Advanced Skill, Alaric gains Lore (Tactics) - useful in cattle raids.
>

Advanced Adventurers
It is perfectly acceptable for Adventurers to begin the game at a higher level than that used for
creating basic, young adult Adventurers.
 
The following lists the ways a Games Master should alter Adventurer Creation in order to create
Adventurers of an advanced experience level.
 
All advanced Adventurers are created normally, including choosing cultural background and
profession, until the time comes to spend Free Skill Points, which they can distribute freely
without limitation.


Community
The final stage of Adventurer Creation is to discover something of the Adventurer’s back-story.
What has happened in the formative years of their life? Who are their family and friends? Has the
Adventurer made any rivals or enemies? How well known is he or she? This section of Adventurer
generation aims to answer these questions.


Families
All Adventurers have families. Family ties might still be close or severed long ago. The family
might be large and rambling or small and close-knit. The family might have a reputation that
has been a help or hindrance to the Adventurer, or its connections might be useful for all sorts
of reasons now or in the future.

Roll 1D100 on each column of the Family Ties Table to determine the parental status, number
of siblings and what the general, extended family structure is like.

For large families it is recommended that details be left deliberately vague. Part of the fun is
introducing that roguish or well-connected uncle or cousin at strategic points in a campaign or
scenario, and keeping family details at a high level allows for considerable flexibility in developing
interesting and intriguing plot twists.

How well is the family connected? Is it important or run-of-the-mill? Is it well liked or does the
family name carry with it a stigma? The following tables help decide how well known the family
is and what kind of weight it carries at local, regional and national levels.

Family Reputation
1D100        Reputation                                          Contacts, Enemies and Rivals
01-20        Poor reputation                                     1D3 Enemies or Rivals
21-50        Average reputation but a few skeletons and          1 Enemy or Rival
          secrets in the background
51-65        Average reputation                                  —
66-85        Good reputation but a few skeletons and             1 Contact or Ally
          secrets in the background
86-00        Reputation of excellent standing                    1D3 Contacts or Allies

Family Connections
1D100        Connections                                        Contacts, Enemies and Rivals
01-20        No connections worth mentioning                    —
21-80        Family has reasonable connections within the       —
          community
81-90        Family is considered well connected with           1 Contact and 1 Rival
          other families and persons holding local
          power
91-95        Family is considered well connected with           2 Contacts, 1 Rival and 1 Enemy
          other families and persons holding local and
          regional power
96-00        Family is considered well connected with           2 Contacts, 2 Rivals and 2
          other families and persons holding local,          Enemies
          regional and national power

As an optional stage for the Adventurer’s background, are they married? Roll 1D100 and
compare it with the Adventurer’s Influence skill. If the result is equal to, or less than, Influence
then the Adventurer is married, should the player wish it. If the result is higher than the
Influence skill he is unmarried. How happily the Adventurer is married is up to the player to
decide - similarly, children. If the Adventurer wants to have children by his spouse then he
may roll 1D3-1, giving a result of between 0 and 2 children, about right for Adventurers in
these kinds of cultures and starting ages. The age of any children will be, again, 1D3-1, with
a result of 0 indicating a new-born.


> Alaric’s Tale
> On the Family Ties table, Alaric’s rolls are 96 (Single Mother), 59 (1D6 Siblings - result of 4; he has
> two brothers and two sisters, Alaric’s player decides) and 68 (1D8 relatives on each parent’s side - a
> total of 9 in all). It is decided that Alaric’s father died several years ago, when Alaric was no more
> than 10 years old, leaving his mother to raise him and his two brothers and two sisters with the help of
> their extensive family. Despite having lost his father, Alaric had plenty of male role-models in his life.
> 
> For Family Reputation the roll is 91 - Alaric’s extended family has an Excellent Reputation and this
> grants 1D3 (result 2) Allies or Contacts. Alaric chooses one of each and decides to detail them later.
> For Family Connections, the 1D100 roll is 33 - so Alaric’s family has reasonable connections within
> the community.
> 
> Alaric’s player decides that Alaric is unmarried - but has designs, to be explored further along in this
> part of Adventurer Creation.


Allies, Contacts, Enemies and Rivals
Through both his family and his personal dealings, an Adventurer may make acquaintances that
will help or hinder him in the future. The Family Reputation and Family Connections tables will
have determined if Allies, Contacts, Enemies or Rivals are present in the Adventurer’s life and,
if so, how many are out there.

* Contacts are individuals that the Adventurer knows and has had friendly dealings with
  in the past. They have useful skills or positions and may be willing to aid the Adventurer.
* Allies are individuals that the Adventurer knows and has had friendly dealings with in the
  past. Allies will actively go out of their way to provide aid when asked for it.
* Rivals are people who hate or oppose the Adventurer and will attempt to interfere or harass
  him.
* Enemies are even worse than Rivals - a Rival will normally work within the law but an
  Enemy wants the Adventurer dead, imprisoned or otherwise doomed.

Note any Allies, Contacts, Enemies or Rivals on the Adventurer sheet along with a little detail
on why they have this relationship with the Adventurer. Players can give as much detail as they
wish, from the sketchy (Rival in the Clan) to the detailed (Harrick the Hairy is my Rival, because I
disobeyed his orders while out hunting. He had me embarrassed in front of the clan elders, damn him!
I’ll have my revenge on him one day!).

Other Adventurers can be Contacts, Allies or even Rivals for the purposes of the Connections
rule (opposite) and may be implicated in Background Events, which follow.


Background Events
When an Adventurer is created he usually begins life as a young man but this does not mean
his previous childhood and adolescence was lived in an uneventful bubble. We all undergo
life-shaping experiences that define who we are, what we do and what approach we have to
life. Games Masters are strongly recommended to spend time with their players developing the
previous lives of the Adventurers. This does not need to be especially detailed and neither does it
need to be too specific. Past experiences can be fleshed-out during the course of play or even be
ignored all together. Establishing the background events to an Adventurer’s life can be extremely
rewarding and provide the fuel for countless future adventures, if the Games Master desires it.


> Alaric’s Tale
> It was determined that Alaric has an Ally and a Contact. He decides to make the Ally his father’s
> brother (so Alaric’s uncle), Marius who is the chieftain of Alaric’s clan. The Contact is Selena, Marius’s
> daughter. The two were childhood friends and Alaric’s player decides that Alaric is in love with Selena
> but dare not admit his feelings until he has proven himself worthy.
> 
> Of course the Cultural Background of the Adventurer will have some say in what these previous
> experiences were, or, at the very least, determine where they took place. But the general nature
> of life experiences tends to be universal. The following table offers a wide selection of possible
> background events and some suggested game effects that the players and Games Master may
> wish to apply to the Adventurers during Adventurer Creation. Every Adventurer should roll
> once on the Background Events table; if the player is feeling very adventurous, then he may roll
> twice. If an event is thought to be restrictive or inappropriate for either the Adventurer or the
> campaign, it can either be ignore, or re-rolled.


Alaric’s Tale
For his Background Event Alaric’s 1D100 roll is 76 - Raised by a Guild or Military Order. The
Games Master knows this is not appropriate given what we know of Alaric already and suggests a
re-roll. The result this time is 56 - Major Wound; Alaric suffered a major wound as a child that left
him with a scar across his left leg. Alaric’s player decides the wound was caused by a troll - the same
troll that killed his father on a hunting expedition - and so now Alaric both fears and hates trolls: he
wants revenge on the troll who murdered his father some day.


Connections
Why do parties of Adventurers come together? This is always an interesting question to answer
when beginning a Legend campaign. Sometimes the Adventurers have a reason for being together
- coming from the same clan, village or town; drinking in the same tavern when monsters
attack it; travelling in the same caravan. Yet perhaps the Adventurers have had some previous,
significant history together, before play begins. This is where the Connections rule comes into
Adventurer Creation and it involves at least two players and their Adventurers.


Alaric’s Tale
Two other Adventurers are being created alongside Alaric: Lilina and Thrace. All are from the same
cultural background and from the same clan, living in the Gloamwood. The three players agree that
Lilina and Thrace were all with Alaric when the troll attacked and murdered his father and gave
Alaric the scar across his leg. The three of them have sworn an oath to find and kill the troll some day.

As this forms a connection with two other Adventurers, Alaric receives +10% to any two skills. He
decides to improve Spear and Shield and Survival.


If both players agree, then any Background Event can involve another suitable Adventurer. Only
one Adventurer needs to have rolled the specific event. If this is done, then both Adventurers gain
a +10% bonus to any skill, Common, Advanced, Combat or Magical, gained so far. Adventurers
may gain a maximum of two such bonuses from this rule and each connection must be with a
different Adventurer.

                                                                                                          29

32

         Players are encouraged to explore and embellish upon a rolled event. For example, how could
two different Adventurers both have a connection through the ‘Mute’ event? In this case, one
Adventurer might act as the other’s interpreter, the two having grown up together and developed
a form of sign language known only to them.


Final Stages
Adventurer Creation is nearly complete. All that remains is to name the Adventurer, if this has
not already been done, determine what, if any, starting magic is available to him and buy the
Adventurer’s beginning equipment using the money determined by Cultural Background.


Names
Legend is a fantasy game and so names reflecting ancient cultures, popular fantasy fiction, TV
and movies are more appropriate than contemporary names. The Cultural Background and
Profession can be of help in naming an Adventurer; a civilised craftsman for example, might be
Urwin the Potter; or a barbarian warrior might be Harrick Swiftaxe, son of Hendrick Redbeard.
Give some thought to the Adventurer’s name - it will be important!


Hero Points
Adventurers begin with 2 Hero Points.


Magic
There are several different types of magic available to Legend Adventurers and the types available
from the start of play depend on the Cultural Background, the Adventurer’s Profession and
the availability of magic in the setting. Is magic commonplace, with every Adventurer having a
smattering of spells learned as part of growing up, or is magic rare and strange, and only those
Adventurers who studied under some arcane tutor possess spells?

If Common Magic is freely available, then the spells that an Adventurer has at the start of the
game depend on his Cultural Background. In such games every Adventurer begins with 6 points
to spend on Common Magic spells, as described in the Common Magic chapter. The following
limits apply to all Adventurers:

*	   1 point is equal to 1 point of Magnitude (thus Bladesharp 2 would cost 2 points)
*	   No spell can exceed Magnitude 3
*	   Spells must be chosen from the Cultural Background Magic table

Thus, Alaric could begin with up to six Magnitude 1 spells, three Magnitude 2 spells or two
Magnitude 3 spells.

The skills used for Divine Magic and Sorcery, and the way each works, are detailed in the
appropriate magical chapter and the Skills chapter

Magic Using Characters
Various professions - Sorcerer, Priest, Shaman and Witch - begin the game with additional
magic to Common Magic, as noted in the Magic column. The skills in this column reflect the
higher types of magic these Professions use, such as Sorcery in the case of the Sorcerer.

Usually access to these forms of higher magic are granted through cult membership, as discussed
in the Cults chapter. Players choosing these Professions may therefore be considered Pious
Members of a divine cult or sorcery order, appropriate to the Adventurer’s background.




34

         Equipment
The Equipment chapter has an extensive list of items Adventurers can purchase but all
Adventurers are assumed to begin the game with the following:

*	   Clothes they wear and a set of spares.
*	   Some personal mementoes, good-luck charms, talismans or similar.
*	   A week’s worth of food, either fresh or preserved.
*	   One weapon relevant to their weapon skills and culture.

If the Adventurer is a Noble by Profession then he also has one of the following:

*	   A set of armour with a maximum protection of 1D6 Armour Points.
*	   An additional weapon that is considered an heirloom.
*	   A mount appropriate to the culture (horse, camel, mule and so forth).
*	   A flask of very good wine.
*	   A piece of flashy-looking jewellery worth 1D6 x100 Silver Pieces.
*	   A set of very fine and expensive spare clothes suitable for a ball or banquet.

Note down the Size, Reach, Damage, attack skill, AP and HP of any weapons the Adventurer
possesses. Also note down Unarmed Combat damage (1D3).



Priests and Shamen: Gain Divine spells appropriate to their cult as defined in the Divine Magic
chapter and based on how much POW is dedicated to the Pact with the god.

Sorcerers and Witches: Gain a Grimoire appropriate to their cult. If a pre-defined cult is being
used then the spells contained in the Grimoire will be already determined. If a Grimoire needs
to be developed from scratch, it will contain up to four Sorcery spells appropriate to the sorcery
order’s nature and teachings.

Greater detail on these types of magic is found in the respective magic chapters.



Alaric’s Tale
Alaric is nearly complete. All that is left to do is decide his Common Magic. Alaric has 6 points
to spend on Common Magic spells. He can only choose spells common to all cultures and those
from the Barbarian column of the Cultural Background Magic table.

Alaric chooses Bladesharp 2 (meaning he can cast it at Magnitude 2), Thunder’s Voice (Magnitude 1),
Heal 2 (Magnitude 2) and Vigour (Magnitude 1).

He casts all four of these spells at his Common Magic skill of 34%.

Equipment he will decide upon later but all the essential components for Alaric are in place. His
completed Adventurer sheet is shown overleaf.

Characteristics and Attributes define an Adventurer in terms of what he is - how strong, how fast,
how much damage he deals with a well-aimed blow and so on. Skills define what an Adventurer
can actually do. Ranging from how well an Adventurer can sneak past a guard and how well he
can sculpt a statue, to his expertise with a sword. Skills quantify just how good an Adventurer is at
specific tasks. The Adventurer Creation process has already introduced Common and Advanced
skills; this chapter explores how skills, in general, work and how each skill works specifically.


Skill Tests
All skills have a starting value based on the sum of two Characteristics or a single Characteristic
multiplied. Cultural Background, Profession and Free Skill Points raise the value of these
skills. There is no upper limit to a skill; it can rise over 100% and even higher, indicating truly
superhuman capabilities. How skills increase is detailed in Adventurer Advancement beginning
on page 68.

When an Adventurer is called on to roll against a skill, he uses 1D100 and is attempting to roll
equal to, or less than, his skill’s value. Achieving this means the skill is used successfully; if the
1D100 roll is above the skill’s value, then the attempt has failed.


Levels of Success and Failure
Whether or not an Adventurer succeeds or fails is important in Legend but it is also very
important to see how well he succeeded or failed. For this reason levels of success are crucial to
the game. The levels of success are (from best to worst):

*	   Critical Success
*	   Success (sometimes referred to as a Normal Success)
*	   Failure
*	   Fumble


When and When Not to Roll
Routine activities; those an Adventurer conducts time and again, under normal circumstances
and expected pressures, do not require a roll for success. For example, riding a horse at a trot or
gentle gallop across an open field, on a fine day, does not need a Ride test. Similarly a blacksmith
making horse shoes with all the right tools and raw materials does not need to make a Craft
(Blacksmith) roll.

Skill Tests are required where the circumstances are out of the ordinary and/or impart some
degree of stress, urgency or difficulty to the situation. Riding a horse at a gallop across an open
field whilst being pursued by bandits is an instance where a Ride roll is called for. Attempting to
make horseshoes with poor quality implements or a Skill Tests of resources is another.

         The watchword is circumstance. The Games Master is the best judge as to whether the conditions
and circumstances warrant a Skill Test. An Adventurer might not need to make a Perception test
to hear a neighbouring conversation if the surroundings are relatively quiet. However, if there is
a degree of background noise it will be necessary to roll to overhear accurately. If the people the
Adventurer is eavesdropping on are whispering, then the Skill Test should incur a penalty for the
circumstances, as outlined in Difficult and Haste.


Difficulty and Haste
Sometimes it will be necessary to make a Skill Test because success or failure needs to be
measured but the circumstances in which the skill is being used need to be taken into account.
Circumstances can make a skill easier or harder to accomplish. For example, running up a
steep hill to out-pace a murderous troll requires an Athletics Skill Test but the hill’s gradient
means that the circumstances are harder than normal: the skill’s value is therefore modified to
reflect this. Conversely hiding from a troll in a dark wood as night sets in, requires a Stealth
Skill Test but the darkness makes hiding easier and so the skill’s value is modified accordingly.
Similarly the amount of time invested in using a skill can have a bearing on its outcome.
Rushing a job leads to errors whereas paying attention to detail and taking one’s time improves
the chance of success.

Circumstances are graded in the Difficulty and Haste Modifiers table. These modifiers are
applied temporarily to the skill’s value until the circumstances change.

The Difficulty Examples table on page 40 lists a few examples of Skill Tests that may occur
in a Legend game, which skills would be used and what difficulty should be assigned to
them. Games Masters can use this table as a reference when creating their own Skill Tests
for the Adventurers.


Rolling in Secret
It is a great deal of fun rolling dice and seeing the outcome. Yet there are going to be
occasions where the game is better served by the Games Master making the dice roll on
behalf of the Adventurers and in secret, only revealing the result through game-play. For
example, an Adventurer might be attempting to disguise himself to gain access to a thieves’
guild. The Adventurer is not aware of how convincing the disguise attempt has been until
it is put into practical use, infiltrating the guild headquarters. If the Disguise Skill Test is
made secretly by the Games Master then it becomes easier to build an air of suspense and
tension as the Adventurer makes his attempts to bypass the guild’s members as he wanders
into the guild buildings.

Not all tests should be made secretly by the Games Master. The best times to use secret rolls are
in the following conditions:

*	    The Adventurer using the skill would have little or no way of knowing how successful
     his skill attempt has been until it is put to a practical test.
*	    The skill’s outcome is not immediate.
*	    Revealing the outcome of the Skill Test incrementally will create a better sense of
     tension.

Games Master dice rolls are, like all game tools, there to increase the enjoyment of the game for
all, not to remove fun and enjoyment from the players. Used with discretion and at times where
the outcome may not be immediate, certain or clear-cut, it can be a great way of introducing
drama to a situation.


Critical Success
For many Skill Tests it is only necessary to determine whether one is successful or not. However,
there may be certain cases where it is important to know how successful an Adventurer was - did
he just skim by or did he achieve an incredible feat? This is determined by critical successes.

A roll of 01 is always a critical success.

If the Skill Test is equal to or less than 10% of the modified skill (rounded up), then the
Adventurer has scored a critical success. Note that the chance of a critical success relates to the
modified skill total being used in the test, not the original ‘normal’ skill level. If an Adventurer
is suffering a penalty to the Skill Test, it will reduce the Adventurer’s chance of scoring a critical
success. Likewise if an Adventurer has a bonus to the Skill Test, it will increase the Adventurer’s
critical success chance.


40

         The actual result of a critical success varies from skill-to-skill and the skill descriptions note the
effects for a critical success. However Games Masters are quite at liberty to apply additional
results to fit the circumstances; for example:

*	   The task is completed sooner.
*	   The task is completed to a higher degree of expertise than normal.
*	   The task is completed with élan and style, generally impressing witnesses.
*	   The Adventurer gains additional information or insight into the task thanks to their
  brilliance.

If a critical success is achieved while crafting jewellery, for instance, the Games Master may
decide that the finished article is of unusually high quality or that the item was completed faster
than usual.


Fumbles
If one can succeed critically, one can also fail critically: a situation known as a fumble. A fumble
occurs when:

*	   The modified skill being used is less than 100%, the result is 99 or 00.The modified skill
  being used is equal to, or more than 100%, 00 is rolled.

Very highly skilled Adventurers, or those in circumstances that make using a skill easier, fail less
often than Adventurers with a lower degree of skill, or in situations where circumstances have
made a skill more difficult to use.

Essentially, fumbling is the diametric opposite of critical success - the Adventurer has botched
the attempt so badly he has experience a dramatic failure.

The precise effects of a fumble depend on the skill and the skill descriptions offer guidance on
what effects a fumbling Adventurer experiences. However, as a rule, fumbles normally result in
one of the following mishaps:

*	   The task takes twice as long to finish and is still a failure.
*	   The task produces a useless result that actually makes further actions more difficult.
*	   The task is failed spectacularly, opening the Adventurer up to derision and scorn from
  witnesses.
*	   The Adventurer becomes impeded or even harmed by his failure.

For Example, Alaric is using his Dance skill to impress Selena, the chieftain’s daughter. Rolling 99
when making his Dance skill roll, Alaric trips, stumbles and crashes into the musicians. The gathered
clan hoots and jeers in derision and Selena’s father, Marius, glares angrily at the red-faced Alaric,
upset that such a prize klutz would attempt such a complicated ritual dance in the first place. Alaric’s
chances of impressing Selena have evaporated and, with it, he has angered her father…

Later, Alaric’s rival for Selena’s affections, Owain, attempts the same dance intending to capitalise
on Alaric’s spectacular failure. Owain’s Dance skill is 92% but the Games Master decides to apply a
+10% bonus reflecting the fact that the crowd is behind Owain’s attempt following Alaric’s fumble.
Owain is therefore rolling against a modified skill of 102%. The dice roll is 00 - Owain also fumbles!
The Games Master explains that Owain, swaggering around the great hall, fails to spot a spilled mug


                                                                                                        41

      of mead, slips on it and executes a stumble every bit as bad as Alaric’s. At the high table Marius shakes
his head sadly and Selena, trying to remain calm as the arrogant Owain climbs to his feet, winks a
smile at Alaric. Alaric’s heart soars.

Weapon Skill Tests are as vulnerable to fumbles as any other test. A fumbled roll on a Bow Skill
Test could result in a snapped bowstring, whilst fumbling a melee weapon attack test could mean
the weapon has been clumsily broken. The Combat chapter provides more detailed guidance on
combat fumble results.


Automatic Success and Failure
Whenever an Adventurer attempts to use a skill, there is always a chance he will succeed or fail,
regardless of the level of his skill. Even a master swordsman with a sword skill of 190% can have
a rock slip under his foot or have the sun hit his eyes at just the wrong moment. Likewise, the
most unfit Adventurer might be able to climb a cliff in a lashing rainstorm at night, even if the
modifiers would reduce his Athletics skill to below 0%.

*	   Any test result of 01 to 05 is an automatic success.
*	   Any test result of 96 to 00 is an automatic failure.

Note that the automatic success and failure rules do not apply if the Games Master has ruled that
no test is required or possible.


Defaulting from an Advanced Skill
Note that while everyone has some facility with Common skills, Advanced skills are generally
only possessed by specialists. Nevertheless, there will be times when an untrained Adventurer
attempts to use an Advanced skill, even though they do not possess it.

In these cases, the Games Master may make one of two decisions. The first is that the task is
simply impossible for the Adventurer. The Adventurer automatically fails the test.

Alternately, the Games Master may decide that a default Common skill may be used for that
specific situation, as long as there is a logical link between the original Advanced skill and the
substitute Common skill. However, such substituted Skill Tests normally suffer at least a -20%
penalty, often more.


Levels of Skill
What is considered routine for an Adventurer with a skill of 60% may well be considered difficult
for an Adventurer with only 25% in the same skill. So, the value of the skill forms one of the
circumstances to take into consideration. The following table gathers skill values into a range of
Competencies along with some guidance on what constitutes a routine task.


Augmenting Skills with Other Skills
There are occasions where one skill can help with another. For example, a merchant trying to
get a good price on a rare vase might want to use his Lore (Pottery) skill to help his Influence
or Commerce skill and thus get a good deal. In such situations it is permissible to allow the
secondary skill to provide a bonus equal to its critical score to the primary skill. Thus, in the
previous example, the merchant has Influence at 70% and Lore (Eastern Pottery) at 63%. The
critical score for Lore (Eastern Pottery) is 7% making the merchant’s Influence 77% in total.

         Skill Competencies Table
Skill Range Competency       Description
01-25       Novice           Basic techniques and principles are usually completed without
                          the need for a Skill Test, if enough time is available and necessary
                          equipment is at hand. Advanced techniques require a Skill Test
                          and may suffer a penalty depending on the nature of the task.
26-50           Competent    All basic and some advanced techniques are possible without
                          a Skill Test if enough time is available and the necessary
                          equipment is at hand. Some advanced techniques require a Skill
                          Test and may suffer a penalty depending on the nature of the
                          task.
51-75           Professional Advanced tasks can be tackled even in the absence of one or two
                          components necessary for success but, again, at a penalty.
76-100          Expert       Almost all techniques are known and can be undertaken
                          with confidence even when the right components have been
                          compromised.
101-125         Master       The Adventurer is supremely confident in their execution of the
                          skill and can readily improvise or resolve problems easily using
                          effective shortcuts.
126+            Grand Master At this level the Adventurer is an absolute virtuoso of the skill
                          and able to tackle, with confidence, any problem involving the
                          skill’s use. The duration taken for most tasks can be halved,
                          if necessary (although a Grand Master knows that time and
                          patience are always key).


Only one skill at a time can be used to boost another skill and the skills must be complementary
to each other for the given situation. The Games Master should also stipulate when an
augmentation like this can be applied; it is never an automatic right.


Group Tests
In essence, this is a time-saving device for the Games Master. With a group test, the Games
Master may make a single percentile roll to determine the success of a group of individuals all
performing the same task, rather than rolling dozens or hundreds of individual die rolls. There
are two kinds of group tests: team tests and sorting tests.


Team Tests
In a team test, success is cooperative; everyone reaps the benefit from a single success. If a squad
of temple guards are all trying to search for an intruder in a crypt, then any successful Perception
test will reveal him to all of them. If each guard rolls a Perception test, not only will things take
longer but their mathematical chance of finding the intruder becomes quite high. The Games
Master rolls once for the highest skill in the team (the highest Perception skill among the temple
guards, for example) and if the roll is a success, everybody succeeds. If the roll is a failure,
everybody fails.

The Games Master may also use a ‘reverse team test’ in a situation where one failure can spell
disaster. For example, if a gang of hunters are attempting to sneak up on a deer, any failed Stealth
test will startle the quarry. In this case, the hunter with the lowest Stealth skill rolls a Stealth test.
If he succeeds, everyone succeeds. If the roll is a failure, everybody fails.

                                                                                                          43

      Sorting Tests
In a sorting test, success is individual. For example, a group of bandits are attempting to outrun
the local constabulary, which calls for opposed Athletics tests. Some of the bandits have an
Athletics skill of 40%, some of 50% and some of 60%. The Games Master rolls a group test for
the bandits, which results in a 49. Those with skills of 50% or more succeed, while the slower
bandits begin to fall behind (unless the remainder of the bandits slow their progress to allow
their fellows to keep up).

It is up to the individual Games Master when to move from multiple individual rolls to
a group test. The former is certainly more authentic but the more individuals involved in
the test, the longer it will take (and the more it will break up the flow of the game) to roll
separately for each.


Large Groups and Percentile Success
From time-to-time, the Games Master may need to determine the success of a large group of people
performing the same task, in a situation in which there is no room for error. In this case, he may
simply take the skill or Characteristic being employed and use that as the percentage of success.

For Example: A group of 100 brigands is attempting to swim across a fast-flowing river a scant
distance upstream from a 200 metre waterfall, an activity which calls for an Athletics Skill Test.
Because of the speed of the current and the nearby waterfall, a failed Skill Test for an individual will
result in their being swept away by the current. Rather than rolling 100 Skill Tests, or rolling only one
to determine whether all 100 brigands made it across, the Games Master may simply take the Athletics
skill as the percentage of success. If the Games Master rules that all the brigands have an Athletics skill
of 75, then 75 of them will make it to the other side of the river. The remaining 25 will be swept away
over the falls, presumably wondering why none of them had the presence of mind to find a safer place
to cross the river.


Assistance
Adventurers often have the opportunity to help one another during various tests. The Games
Master is the final judge as to which tests can be helped with assistance and which require an
Adventurer to make the test alone. For instance, if an Adventurer is attempting to lift a huge log
out of a road, then clearly several others can help him in the Athletics test required. However, an
Adventurer trying to break down a barred door may jam up the doorway too much for anyone
else’s shoulder to fit. An Adventurer trying to recall the details of the local history of his own
village cannot have strangers help him but several sages can piece together the history of the
kingdom from their own memories.

Every assisting Adventurer adds his critical score to the primary Adventurer’s skill. Remember to
apply any relative modifiers to the assisting Adventurer’s skill before determining the critical score.

The Games Master is the final arbiter of how many Adventurers may assist in any given test and
how many attempts may be made in what period of time.


Opposed Skills
An opposed Skill Test occurs when one skill is actively resisted by another. For example a thief
attempts to sneak past a wily palace guard who, being vigilant, is on the look-out for potential
crooks.


44

         In an opposed test both participants roll their respective skills. The winner of the test is the
one who gains the higher level of success; if both participants have the same level of success,
then the winner is the one with the higher dice roll within his skill range. (In the extremely
unlikely situation that both Adventurers have exactly the same dice result and the same Level
of Success, then the Adventurer with the highest skill wins. If it is still a draw, toss a coin to
determine the winner!)

If both fail then a stalemate has occurred, forcing the opposed test to be rolled again at a later
point.

For example: The cunning thief is attempting to sneak past the vigilant palace guard. The thief uses
his Stealth skill, which is at 75%. The guard is opposing with his Perception skill of 60%. Dice are
rolled. The thief rolls 71% and the guard rolls 59%. Both have succeeded but the thief has the higher
roll within his skill range and sneaks past. Conversely, if the guard has rolled 59% and the thief had
rolled 54%, again, both have succeeded but the guard has the higher roll and so spots the thief as he
emerges from the shadows.

If both had failed then other circumstances would have intervened. In the previous example, for
instance, a chambermaid might have entered the courtyard distracting the guard but interrupting
the thief. Once she has passed, the opposed test can be attempted again.

Example: Alaric and Owain are engaged in a race. This calls for Athletics opposed skills. Alaric’s
Athletics is 35% and Owain’s is 95%. The dice are rolled and Owain scores 94 - a very good roll since
it is a high roll and less than his skill percentage. Alaric’s roll is 02 - a critical success and this beats
Owain’s standard success. Alaric’s lucky burst of speed clearly overwhelmed Owain’s energy-conserving
pace. Had Alaric rolled between 05 and 24, Owain would have won because whilst both Adventurers
succeed, Owain’s is the higher roll whilst still being a normal success.

Opposed Skill Tests are extremely useful for many situations where the skills of one party need
to be weighed directly against the skills of another.

*	   Bargaining (Adventurers match Commerce and Commerce, or Commerce and Influence)
*	   Evading detection (Adventurer matches Stealth against the opponent’s Perception)
*	   Persuading (Adventurer matches Influence against Persistence)
*	   Pursuits (participants match Athletics skills, or Evade against Athletics)
*	   Withstanding torture (Adventurer matches Resilience against Lore (Torture))
*	   Hiding or palming an object (Sleight against Perception)


Opposed Skills Over 100%
During opposed tests, whichever participant has the highest mastered skill subtracts 100% from
it and uses the remainder as a penalty to everyone in the contest. Thus the most skilled participant
has a skill of 100% and everyone else is less than this. This has the benefit of introducing an
increased chance of failure for the lesser skilled opponents in the contest; thus improving the
chance of a better victory level.

For example, Mikhail the mercenary possesses a Stealth skill of 120%. Since he is the most experienced
character he reduces all his opponents’ Perception skills by 20% and he himself is lowered to 100%.

The identification of who has the highest skill must be calculated after any other modifiers for
circumstances have been applied.


                                                                                                             45

      Using Non-Combat Skills in Combat
The Skill Use Combat Action allows Adventurers to use their skills in combat situations whenever
they deem it appropriate. For example, an Adventurer may be desperately trying to open a locked
door to escape an oncoming enemy who is currently fighting his comrades.

The actual Skill Tests made are performed as described previously. However, in combat it becomes
important to know how long a skill takes to perform. Most will take only a single Combat Action
and there are some specific examples listed in the skill descriptions later in this chapter.

The greatest problem with using a skill in combat is that it is quite possible to be interrupted in
the middle of skill use by a random event (such as being struck by a sword). When an Adventurer
must use a skill over a number of Combat Rounds, the final effect of the skill (and the test itself )
will not normally take place until the end of the final Combat Action. In the meantime, the
Adventurer must concentrate on the skill being used - he cannot suspend his skill use to initiate
an attacking Combat Action, for instance.

Normally, an interruption to the skill user will result in either a penalty to the final test or the
test automatically failing.


Common Skill Descriptions
Every Adventurer has access to all the Common skills during Adventurer Creation. These skills
detail the most common actions every person in the world can succeed in to one degree or
another. Each skill is derived from a combination of two Characteristics or a single Characteristic
multiplied.


Athletics (STR+DEX)
This broad skill covers a range of athletic activities useful to Adventurers, including climbing,
jumping and running.

If an Adventurer is wearing armour, the distances he can climb, run or jump are affected by
the Armour Penalty. The section on Movement on page 92 of the Game System chapter details
these effects. When using Athletics for the following specific actions the rate of Movement is
determined by how it has been modified by the effects of any armour worn.

Climbing: Given enough hand and footholds, the right equipment and enough time, an
Adventurer can climb any surface without the need for a test. Under normal circumstances, an
Adventurer can climb or descend one quarter of his Movement as a Combat Action.

*	   Climbing a rough surface (trees, steep hills and so on): The Armour Penalty is subtracted
from three quarters of the base Movement (6 metres per Combat Action for human
Adventurers). If the result is zero or less, they are too burdened by their armour to climb.
Thus, our hero in his plate armour cannot climb as his Climbing Movement is 6-9 = -3.

*	   Climbing a sheer surface (walls, cliff faces and so on): The Armour Penalty is subtracted
from the base Movement divided by two. As with climbing a rough surface, if the result is
zero or less, the Adventurer cannot climb.




46

         *	   Tests should be made for treacherous surfaces (such as sheer cliffs or wet surfaces) and if an
  Adventurer is trying to increase the rate of his ascent or descent. An Adventurer can double
  the rate of his modified Movement by taking a -20% penalty on his Athletics test.

A critical Climbing success allows the Adventurer to triple his Movement rate for the climb.

A fumbled Climbing roll means the Adventurer falls and cannot make an Acrobatics test (if he
has the skill) to attempt to reduce the falling damage.

Jumping: In general, a successful Athletics test allows an Adventurer to jump up to twice his own
height horizontally or up to half his own height vertically, if he has at least five metres to run first.
If he is making a standing jump, these distances are halved. Leaps of over half an Adventurer’s
maximum distance result in him falling prone on landing.

*	   If armoured, reduce the distance in metres the Adventurer can jump by the Armour Penalty
  divided by two.

*	   For every full 20% he possesses in this skill, the Adventurer may add an extra metre to a
  horizontal jump, or 20 centimetres to a vertical jump, if he has space to perform a run up.

*	   For a critical success the Adventurer adds a further metre to his total distance and remains
  upright on landing.

A fumbled Jump roll indicates the Adventurer has landed awkwardly. He must immediately
make a Resilience test. If the Resilience test is successful he sustains 1 point of damage to each
leg. If the Resilience test fails, then he sustains 1D4 points of damage to each leg.

Throwing: Athletics is also used for throwing items and is used to judge the accuracy of the
Adventurer when throwing improvised objects, from small stones to bar stools. Weapons that are
thrown use their own specific skill, such as Spear for javelins.

A thrown object has a maximum range of one metre for every point the Adventurer’s STR
exceeds the object’s ENC. The Athletics roll measures the Adventurer’s accuracy during the
throw and the Games Master may choose to treat this as a Ranged Combat attack, as described
on page 140, if the situation warrants it.


Brawn (STR+SIZ)
Brawn is used where physical force (pushing, pulling and lifting) needs to be implemented;
forcing a jammed door, for instance, or pulling a cart free of a rut in the road.

An Adventurer can lift up his STR x1.5 in SIZ without making a Brawn roll. As a mass equivalent,
one point of SIZ equals, roughly, 3.5 kilograms.

For SIZ and mass above this, the Adventurer needs to succeed in a Brawn roll and if successful
he can lift up to three times his STR. If the roll is a critical success, then up to five times STR
can be lifted.

If the Brawn roll is fumbled, the Adventurer risks injury: he must make a successful Resilience
roll or sustain 1D3 points of damage to the Chest Hit Location (armour does not protect against
this damage).


                                                                                                         47

      Common Magic (POW+CHA)
This skill relates to the magic commonly used by the Adventurer’s community and to which he will
have had daily exposure whilst growing up, becoming familiar with a variety of spells and magical
effects that are used in the daily tasks of his society. The spells of Common Magic are described in
the Common Magic chapter and cover a wide variety of different effects, situations and scenarios.

If a Common Magic roll is a critical success, then the spell costs 1 less Magic Point (to a minimum
of 1) to cast.

If the roll fumbles, then the Adventurer expends all the Magic Points for the spell’s Magnitude
but the spell still fails.


Culture (Own) (INT x2)
The Culture skill is actually several separate skills, each dealing with a specific culture. The
Culture skill is distinct from Lore and Language skills, as it represents a person’s understanding
of, and ability to heed, the behaviours, habits, customs and everyday rituals of a specific cultural
group. For example, someone making a successful test in Culture (Nomads of the Wastes)
understands that it is considered good manners to remove all head-gear and footwear whenever
entering a person’s tent; or knows that it is considered polite to pass the bread from left to right
at a Waste-Nomad feast, whilst the fermented milk is always passed from right to left.

A critical success grants the Adventurer a unique understanding or insight into the workings of
a particular cultural group, subgroup or type. The Games Master should reveal one or two key,
previously unknown, facts about the culture to the Adventurer. Additionally the Adventurer may
add the critical value of his Culture skill to any communication or personal credibility tests made
in the immediate circumstances.

A fumble indicates the Adventurer has completely misunderstood a particular cultural practice,
reference or social code, which causes an embarrassment that will be, at best, humiliating or, at
worst, insulting. The Adventurer will be ostracised until suitable reparations are made.

Culture (Specific Culture) can also be learned as an Advanced skill when the Adventurer studies
a different culture to his own.


Dance (DEX+CHA)
An Adventurer with this skill is accomplished at moving gracefully in time with music or other
rhythm, using standardised and often intricate steps and movements. A successful test with
Dance results in the audience or partner being pleased by the Adventurer’s performance.

On a critical success the dance is expressive, fluid and deeply affecting for all who witness it.
Music is accompanied by perfect movement and emotion. The dance is as persuasive as any
Influence test and can be used as such in situations resting on communication and personal
credibility. Alternatively any subsequent Influence test is given a bonus to the critical score of
the Dance skill.

A fumbled dance is deeply humiliating to both the dancer and those who watch it. The dancer
trips or stumbles. Passion is lost, the execution is clumsy and the dance fails to interpret the
music in any shape or form. Any skills resting on communication and personal credibility will
suffer a penalty at the discretssion of the Games Master.


48

         Drive (DEX+POW)
If an Adventurer is driving a wagon, chariot or similar vehicle at not more than a walking pace
across flat terrain, a Drive roll is not required. Rolls are needed when an Adventurer wants to
do something out of the ordinary with a vehicle - traverse treacherous terrain, jump obstacles
and so on.

A critical result either increases the vehicle’s movement by half again, if the skill is being used
in a straightforward manner. If being used to perform a special manoeuvre, such as evading an
enemy, a critical success allows half the Adventurer’s normal Drive skill to be used as a negative
modifier against any applicable skills being used by pursuers for the rest of the Combat Round.

For example: Vadrus the Charioteer is being pursued by the war chariot of his enemy, Kortek. Kortek
is hurling javelins with abandon and Vadrus declares he’s going to try to wheel his horses in a bid to
evade the javelins. The Games Master calls for a Drive Skill Test from Vadrus’s player. Vadrus’s Drive
skill is 70% and the dice roll is 06. This means that a -35% penalty is now applied to Kortek’s attack
rolls as Vadrus’s chariot weaves and swerves.

A fumbled Drive roll indicates either a reduction in the vehicle’s speed by half or, if the vehicle
is trying to perform a special manoeuvre, it becomes unstable and overturns. If the vehicle
overturns all occupants need to make a successful Athletics test to leap clear of the wreckage or
sustain 1D6 points of damage to a random location as the vehicle crashes.


Evade (DEX x 2)
Evade is used to escape from impending danger and can be used against ranged weapons (by
dodging or diving out of the way), avoiding traps (triggered, sprung or otherwise), changing
the engagement distance in combat and generally getting out of the way of a potential physical
hazard.

For most tasks such as dodging traps or spells, the skill is opposed by the deadliness of the trap
(i.e. the skill of its setter) or the casting skill of the sorcerer. Winning the opposed test allows
the user to completely escape harm. On the other hand, if they lose they suffer the normal
consequences.

For example, Alaric, investigating a murky old burial mound of (perhaps) Jade Throne Kingdom
origin comes across a sarcophagus. He tries to open it and triggers the dart trap set 500 years ago, by
the sarcophagus’s designers. The trap-setter’s skill at the time was 65%; Alaric’s Evade is 46% - he
must pit this against the trap in an opposed roll. Alaric scores 45 and the Games Master rolls 31. Both
are successful but Alaric wins the contest with the higher roll. The trap is sprung as Alaric lifts the
sarcophagus lid and a hail of darts whirr towards his face: Alaric, prepared for such an eventuality,
ducks deftly to one side and the darts strike the wall behind.

Since most quadruped or swimming creatures lack the Evade skill, they may substitute their
Athletics skill for these situations instead. In a the same way, flying creatures can substitute their
Fly skill for Evade when aloft.

If the Evade roll is fumbled, then the Adventurer has left himself open to the hazard and sustains
its maximum damage.




                                                                                                       49

      Evaluate (INT+CHA)
Every Adventurer places a sense of worth on valuables, trades or propositions. The Evaluate skill enables
the Adventurer to determine the value placed on something by others, effectively guessing its market
value. With the Evaluate skill, the Adventurer can try to determine the value of specific objects.

Particularly common or obscure objects might give a bonus or penalty to the test but success
will allow an Adventurer to guess the average monetary value of the object (normally guessing
accurately to within 10% of its actual value).

For a critical success the Adventurer not only estimates the item’s value precisely, he also
determines a secret or hitherto unknown fact about it that can be used to increase the item’s
value by half again.

For example, examining a rare alabaster vase, Matvalk the Merchant scores a critical Evaluate and
correctly values the vase at 500 SP. He also notices a minute signature on the base meaning that the
vase came from the Shah of Ashan’s renowned slave potter, Gustubus. This means the vase is highly
sought after and could be sold for up to 750 SP.

If the Evaluate fumbles, not only does the Adventurer completely misjudge the value of the
object, he devalues it by half again. Thus, if Matvalk in the previous example had fumbled his
Evaluate roll, he would have valued the vase at only 250 SP.


First Aid (DEX+INT)
Living in a dangerous world, most Adventurers are adept at First Aid to one degree or another.
First Aid is always applied to a specific location. See the First Aid Actions table. An Adventurer
may apply First Aid to himself, though there is usually at least a -10% penalty owing to the
awkwardness of applying the treatment.

It normally takes 1D3 minutes to administer First Aid. Neither person can move and Combat
Actions cannot be used for any other activity.

A location that has had any variation of First Aid administered to it cannot benefit from First Aid
again until it has fully healed (it is restored to maximum Hit Points once more).

The use of First Aid requires suitable medical equipment such as bandages or salves. Makeshift
medical equipment (such as bandages made from strips of cloth hastily torn from a dirty tunic)
will bestow a -20% penalty on the test.

First Aid Actions
Injury                 Treatment
Impalement             A successful First Aid test removes the impaling item without causing
                  more damage to the victim.
Unconsciousness        A successful First Aid test can revive an Adventurer from unconsciousness,
                  though drugged patients may inflict a penalty on the First Aid test.
Injured location       A successful First Aid test on an injured location (but not one of 0 or less
                  Hit Points) heals 1D3 Hit Points to that location.
Serious Injury         A successful First Aid test on a location suffering from a Serious Injury
                  heals one Hit Point to a location and restores it to functionality (in the case
                  of a limb) or consciousness (in the case of the Abdomen, Chest or Head).
Major Injury           A successful First Aid test on a location suffering from a Major Injury does
                  not restore the location’s Hit Points. This First Aid merely stabilises the
                  patient so that they will not die from the injury.

50

         A critical success in First Aid reduces the treatment time by half. If being used to treat an Injured
location (see the First Aid Actions table), then 1D3+1 Hit Points are restored to the hurt location.

A fumbled First Aid attempt causes more harm than good: the Hit Location being treated suffers
a further 1 point of damage.


Influence (CHA x 2)
Adventurers skilled in Influence find it easy to persuade others to their way of thinking, whether
they are trying to persuade a king to send armies to fight a distant enemy, bribe a guard or merely
get a merchant to sell them something at a reduced price.

Influence tests are normally opposed by the Perception, Persistence or Influence skill and are
modified by how much an Adventurer is trying to change an opponent’s mind. For instance,
getting a merchant to accept gems instead of coinage as payment is relatively easy, whilst trying
to buy a sword for a 50% discount is not.

For a critical success the Adventurer’s efforts are incredibly persuasive, so much so that not only
is the Adventurer successful in what he is trying to attain with his Influence skill but his next
Influence test with the same person, no matter when it takes place, is at a bonus equal to the
Adventurer’s CHA.

For example, Matvalk the Merchant, having now determined the vase he is studying is worth 750
SP tries to convince the seller that it is a worthless piece of tat. His Influence test is a critical success
and Matvalk walks away with the vase for a trifling 200 SP. In his next Influence test with the same
merchant, Matvalk’s Influence will be at a +14% bonus, for Matvalk’s CHA value.

A fumbled Influence roll indicates that not only does the Influence attempt fail; it also insults or
offends the person being influenced. The reaction depends on the individual and the situation
but at the very least it means that all future Influence tests against the same person will be at a
-40% penalty.


Insight (INT+POW)
Insight is the ability to read a person’s verbal and non-verbal behaviours and signals to determine
their motives and state of mind. Insight is used to decide if someone is telling a lie, or to predict
how someone feels about a particular situation. It is distinct from the Perception skill, since it is
used to detect subtle expressions of character and attitude, rather than tangible effects that can
be assessed through general observation alone.

Sometimes it may be more effective for the Games Master to roll the outcome of an Adventurer’s
Insight attempt, keeping the result of the roll secret and revealing information according to the
degree of success (or failure) - as the results for a critical success or a fumble suggest.

For a critical success the Adventurer gains the ability to second guess how the person under
analysis will react to a given situation. The Games Master should offer private hints to the
Adventurer regarding the person’s motivations and likely actions.

For a fumble, the Adventurer completely misjudges the analysed person’s motives and actions.
The Games Master should offer the Adventurer a series of private, deliberately misleading hints
regarding the person’s motivations and likely actions.


                                                                                                             51

      Alaric’s Tale
Matvalk the merchant has come to Alaric’s village to sell his collection of rare pottery. Alaric is
suspicious of the merchant’s intentions, sensing that Matvalk believes the barbarians of the village to
be unsophisticated half-wits. The Games Master makes an Insight roll for Alaric, concealing the result
from Alaric’s player: the result is 03 - a critical success against Alaric’s Insight 45%. Taking Alaric’s
player to one side the Games Master tells him that Matvalk, whilst making a convincing and sincere
pretence of being an honest trader has all the hallmarks of worshipping the Trickster god - never
a good sign in a barbarian settlement. From now on Alaric will be on the look out for Matvalk’s
cunning plans and schemes to make trouble. However, the Games Master does not tell Alaric’s player
what the degree of success actually was for the Insight roll: Alaric will find this out for himself in the
course of play but the Games Master will ensure that Alaric notices anything Matvalk does that reeks
of Trickster worship.



Lore (INT x 2)
The Lore skill is actually many different skills, each of which must be improved separately. Each
Lore skill defines an area of knowledge for the Adventurer and tests are made whenever a player
wants to see if his Adventurer knows something about the subject at hand. This effectively allows
the player to ask the Games Master direct questions if the test is successful.

Every Adventurer has, as a Common Skill, Lore (Regional). This is a measure of the Adventurer’s
familiarity with the geography, flora and fauna of the area where he has grown up or spent the
most significant amount of time prior to his adventuring career. Attempting to use this skill in
unfamiliar circumstances will be at a disadvantage. For instance, an Adventurer raised in an arctic
mountain range will suffer a penalty to Lore (Regional) skills in an equatorial desert.

For a critical success the Adventurer has gained some specific insight or made a startling discovery
as a result of the critical success in the Lore skill. The Adventurer should be given one specific
fact, relevant to the scenario or campaign that the he can then use as he sees fit.

A fumbled Lore test indicates a complete misunderstanding of the tenets of the Lore in question.
In the case of Lore (Regional), for instance, this might mean mistaking a poisonous fungus for
an edible one or placing the capital of a country 1,000 miles from its true position.


Perception (INT+POW)
The Perception skill is used to represent the senses of the Adventurer when detecting objects or
other persons. It covers listening for sounds, searching a room, hunting for a specific clue and so on.

On a critical success the Adventurer has picked-up on a nuance unseen, or unheard, by everyone
else. A critical Perception test offers a single burst of enlightenment or recognition that helps
avert disaster or completely reveals the concealed.

Fumbling a Perception test leads to the Adventurer being utterly oblivious to his surroundings.
He is blissfully unaware of the impending ambush; he has not got a clue that a missing diamond
ring layinglies a metre away from his left foot. Fumbling a Perception test in circumstances where
the Adventurer is likely to face some threat, such as an attack, provides a bonus to the initial
attacks of the opposing side when it launches its schemes.



52

         Persistence (POW x 2)
Persistence is used whenever an Adventurer has his mental willpower called into question. This
may be for anything as simple as concentrating on a task at hand amidst distraction, or it may be
to resist the baleful effects of a mind-controlling spell.

A critical success in resisting magic means that no further spells cast by the opponent have any
affect on the Adventurer for a number of Combat Actions equal to the Adventurer’s current
Magic Points.

In the case of utilising willpower or mental fortitude, a critical Persistence roll enables the
Adventurer to shrug-off any psychological effects of the situation and to remain undeterred by
whatever it is he is experiencing.

Fumbling the Persistence test when resisting magic makes the psychological effect of the spell
permanent until healed.

If the fumble concerns a matter of willpower, not only does the Adventurer completely fold
under the pressure of the experience but becomes unable to conduct any other actions for 1D6
minutes due to the sheer mental strain.


Alaric’s Tale
During a banquet the boastful Owain is clearly attempting to woo the dazzling Selena. Alaric,
having consumed a few mugs of mead, watches the flirting with barely concealed jealousy. The Games
Master calls for a Persistence roll, applying a -20% penalty for the mead Alaric has drunk. Alaric
has Persistence 58% and rolls 52 - a failure with the penalty taken into account. Alaric can keep his
jealousy under control no longer and decides to confront his rival.




Resilience (CON x 2)
Resilience is the physical counterpart to Persistence. The higher an Adventurer’s Resilience, the
more likely he is to handle adverse physical conditions, such as weathering a vicious sandstorm,
surviving in a drought or overcoming the effects of poison or disease. It is an important skill for
assessing the reaction to injury, as outlined on page 11.

When resisting poisons or diseases a critical success allows the Adventurer to avoid making any
further Resistance rolls against that specific dose or infection.

Fumbling when resisting means that the poison or disease has overwhelmed the Adventurer and
that they automatically fail any further Resistance rolls against it.

Persistence and Resilience as Skills
Whilst described as skills, both Persistence and Resilience are a combination of natural
capability, personal fortitude and training to deal with situations involving mental and
physical stress, including pain. All of us have untapped reserves of Persistence and Resilience;
these skills measure the Adventurer’s ability to draw upon them to resist a variety of different
pressures and conditions.




                                                                                                    53

      Optional Rule - Limits to Persistence and Resilience
There are limits to mental and physical endurance; barriers beyond which the mind and body
cannot be pushed and surrender becomes inevitable. To represent this, Games Masters may wish
to rule in their campaign that Persistence cannot exceed the value of the POW Characteristic
multiplied by 5 and Resilience cannot exceed the CON Characteristic multiplied by five. The
starting values for each skill are both calculated as normal but they are now no longer ‘limitless’
skills. Of course, their limits can be extended through the improvement of their respective
Characteristic scores.


Ride (DEX+POW)
If an Adventurer is riding a creature (with the help of whatever riding equipment is common
to his Cultural Background) at not more than a walking pace across flat terrain, a Riding test
will never be required. Tests are required when an Adventurer wants to do something out of the
ordinary with a mount - traverse treacherous terrain, jump obstacles, ride bareback and so on.

Riding an unfamiliar species is at least a Difficult (-20%) test; riding a species in a different
medium (a horseman riding a dolphin or a griffin, for example) is at least a Hard (-40%) test.

A critical Ride test allows the Adventurer to double the mount’s Movement for a number of
Combat Rounds equal to the rider’s critical range for the Ride skill. Thus, an Adventurer with a
Ride skill of 50% would double the movement rate for five Combat Rounds.

Fumbling a Ride test means the Adventurer must make an Athletics test to avoid losing control
and being thrown from the mount (sustaining any falling damage as appropriate).


Sing (POW+CHA)
All Adventurers are gifted with the tools for singing (unless mute), unlike those who play other
musical instruments. Few, however, develop the skill beyond their innate talent (or lack of ). A
successful test with this skill results in the audience being pleased - or even pleasantly surprised
- by the Adventurer’s performance.

A critical Sing success can have one of several effects. If singing to earn money, increase by half
again the amount earned due to the audience’s appreciation of the performance. If being used
to impress someone, add the Sing’s critical score to the Adventurer’s Influence skill. Thus, an
Adventurer with a Sing skill of 70% would add +7 to his Influence test.

If fumbled, then the song was truly terrible; off-key, out of tune and poorly performed. Halve the
earnings and the singer suffers a penalty to future Influence rolls at the Games Master’s discretion
and the circumstances of the fumble.


Sleight (DEX+CHA)
This skill is used to hide or take objects, without drawing undue attention. It is usually opposed
by a Perception test if trying to avoid getting caught.

The object being manipulated can be of any size but particularly small or large objects will bestow
bonuses or penalties to the test. For instance, hiding a dagger on a well-clothed person is relatively
easy (+20%) but attempting to hide a war sword on the same person is far harder (-20%).




54

         If the Sleight attempt is being made whilst others are around, perhaps with some vigilance, then
the attempt is an opposed roll against the Perception of likely observers.

On a critical success the Adventurer has concealed or palmed the object so successfully that any
subsequent attempts to locate it, using a Perception test, for example, are subject to a penalty
(decided by the Games Master) plus the critical score of the Sleight skill.

On a fumble, not only is the item not concealed, it is dropped or otherwise exposed in full view
of whoever is watching. If no one is actively watching for the deception, the sound of the item
falling, or some other commotion immediately attracts their attention.


Stealth (DEX+INT)
The Stealth skill is used whenever an Adventurer attempts to personally evade detection by
another Adventurer. This usually happens when an Adventurer either tries to move quietly past
an enemy, hide from one or perform a combination of both. Stealth tests are typically opposed
by the Perception skill and are modified according to the situation.

On a critical success any subsequent attempts to locate the Adventurer (follow him, find him and
so on) are at a penalty plus the critical score of the Stealth skill.

For a fumble the Adventurer stumbles and causes some form of commotion that immediately
attracts the attention of anyone in the vicinity. Furthermore, if any other Adventurers are
attempting a Stealth test in the fumbling Adventurer’s company, they suffer a penalty to future
Stealth rolls at the Games Master’s discretion and the circumstances of the fumble.


Swim (STR+CON)
Adventurers normally swim at half their usual Movement. Swim rolls are only required when
conditions are less than ideal - swimming while heavily encumbered or in strong currents, for
example. Failure of a Swim test while swimming will usually result in the Adventurer not moving
at all, though repeated failures may result in drowning. See the Game System chapter on page
76 for more details.

A critical Swim test allows the Adventurer to swim at his normal Movement rate.

On a fumble the Adventurer gets into difficulties due to the water conditions. He must make a
successful Resilience test or sustain Suffocation damage as described on pages 76-78.


Unarmed (STR+DEX)
The Unarmed skill covers all trained and untrained unarmed combat from simple brawling to
esoteric martial arts. Punches, kicks, head-butts and all other Unarmed attacks do 1D3 points
of damage.

If using Unarmed the Adventurer may choose to either strike to cause damage or initiate (or
break) a grapple.




                                                                                                55

      Advanced Skill Descriptions
Advanced skills are those that Adventurers are not expected to have automatically. These skills
often require long and difficult training and Adventurers who possess any level of expertise in
them often identify themselves according to their expertise. An Adventurer will not have access
to many of these skills during Adventurer Creation but others can be learnt through experience.


Acrobatics (STR+DEX)
Acrobatics covers a range of entertainments, for things such as juggling or tightrope walking. It
also includes gymnastics such as tumbling and recovering from falls. Acrobatics can be used in
its own right as a performance to impress an audience; but can also provide a bonus to Athletics
and Evade Skill Tests. If used in this way, it adds its critical range as a bonus to the base skill.

Normally, an Adventurer can move at half his base speed across an unstable surface without
penalty. To move at his full rate requires an Acrobatics test. A successful Acrobatics test will also
halve the damage suffered from falling.

A critical success allows the Adventurer to double his movement rate when performing a feat of
balance or when negotiating an unstable surface. If falling, a critical success will reduce falling
damage to a quarter.

A fumbled Acrobatics roll means that balance and agility has been lost catastrophically. Not only
does the Adventurer fall, he falls awkwardly, sustaining the full damage from the fall!


Art (POW+CHA)
This skill allows an Adventurer to create works of art. Like the Lore and Craft skills, it is actually a
large number of skills grouped together under one heading. There are literally dozens of different
artistic endeavours an Adventurer may pursue and each of them is its own individual skill. For
instance, an Adventurer who wishes to take up the brush and palette would take Art (Painting).

A critical success indicates that the artwork produced is of stunning quality - worth half the
standard value again of similar products. If being used as part of an Influence test, to impress
a prospective client or ally perhaps, then the Influence test will receive a bonus plus the critical
score for the Art skill.

Conversely a fumble means that the artwork is a disaster and worth only what recoverable raw
materials were used in its creation. Such artwork cannot be used to influence another party,
without causing insult.


Boating (STR+CON)
This covers small waterborne craft propelled manually by oars or paddles (sail-driven craft are
used with the Shiphandling Advanced skill). Travelling across calm water does not usually require
a test but adverse conditions such as currents and weather can bestow penalties.

A critical Boating success increases the Movement rate for the craft by half again.

If a Boating test is fumbled, the Adventurer should make an Athletics test. If the Athletics test
succeeds then the Adventurer has lost an oar or the controlling device for the boat has been



56

         broken. Reduce the craft’s movement by half. If the Athletics test is a failure or fumble, then the
boat is in danger of capsizing. All on board need to make either an Acrobatics or Athletics test
(whichever is higher) to remain in the boat. Those that fail fall into the water.


Commerce (INT+CHA)
This skill is used to secure the best price for goods being either bought or sold and it can
be opposed by another Commerce roll, with the victor securing the advantage. Commerce is
more than just haggling or simple bargaining; it is concerned with negotiation, compromise,
brinksmanship and knowledge of the strength (or weakness) of the market for what is being
traded. Where highly complex commercial deals are being discussed, a succession of opposed
Commerce rolls might be called for, with cumulative bonuses or penalties (no greater than +/-
10% at a time) applied to the winner or loser, simulating the ebb and flow of the negotiation
before settlement is reached.

A critical success allows the Adventurer to secure the commodity or service at half its usual price
(or selling it for double).

A fumble indicates that the commodity or service is secured at twice the price or sold for only
half the value.


Courtesy (INT+CHA)
A noble court, from that of a minor lord to the grand palace of an emperor usually conducts
its business, or communicates, in ways that would seem utterly alien to a commoner. With this
skill, the Adventurer knows how to navigate the murky and treacherous waters of life amongst
the nobility. He understands the subtleties and extravagances of courtly behaviour and can use
them to his own advantage.

A critical success means the Adventurer has made a superb impression with his courteousness
and gains a bonus, plus the critical value of his Courtesy skill, in any Influence or similar tests,
made soon after the Courtesy skill.

A fumble causes a devastating faux-pas. The Adventurer is prevented from performing any
subsequent Skill Tests involving communication or personal credibility, until reparations have
been made.


Craft (DEX+INT)
Like the Lore skill, the Craft skill is actually several separate skills grouped under a single
heading. For example, Craft (Armourer), Craft (Carpenter), Craft (Torturer) and Craft (Potter)
are all individual skills.

Craft skills are used to fashion and create various items and there are literally hundreds of different
crafts in the world, from the mundane to the exotic. The following list is by no means exhaustive:

Armourer, baker, basketweaver, blacksmith, bowyer, brewer, butcher, candlemaker, carpenter,
cartographer, cobbler, cook, cooper, fletcher, joiner, leatherworker, mason, painter, potter, sculptor,
smith, tailor, torturer, weaver.




                                                                                                       57

      A critical success allows the item being crafted to be of superior quality, in terms of durability,
value or utility (choose one area of excellence). In terms of durability, it has additional AP and
HP, distributed as the Adventurer sees fit, equal to the critical score of the skill. For example,
a weaponsmith who crafts an especially fine longsword using his skill of 81% can distribute 8
additional points between the sword’s AP and HP. In terms of value, increase the item’s value
by half again. In terms of utility, the item provides a bonus equal to its maker’s critical score to
whichever skill the item is used for.

A fumbled roll halves the Armour and Hit Points of the item and reduces its value by half.


Culture (Specific Culture) (INT x2)
Learning the ways of a Culture other than one’s own is an Advanced skill. However it works in
precisely the same way as for the Culture (Own) Common Skill. See page 48.


Disguise (INT+CHA)
This skill is used to change an Adventurer’s appearance, imitate cultural accents and mannerisms,
or assume a different persona. It is usually opposed by an Insight or Perception test if the
Adventurer is trying to avoid being identified.

A Disguise test will often be modified by the materials an Adventurer has to hand. For instance,
it would be very hard to disguise an Adventurer as a royal guardsman if he has no uniform
available, whereas an old and moulding cloak will go a long way to helping an Adventurer pull
off a disguise as a beggar.

A critical success indicates that the disguise is completely perfect. The Adventurer gains the
confidence of those being deceived and receives a bonus, plus the critical score in the Disguise
skill, to any further Skill Tests relying upon the effectiveness of the disguise.

A fumble means the disguise is so unconvincingly executed as to be obvious. Even in a dark
room, it fools no one.


Engineering (INT x2)
This skill is used to design, build, activate, repair, sabotage or disassemble large mechanisms,
traps or constructs such as siege machines, city gates, drawbridges, mineshafts, sailing ships and
so forth.

A critical success indicates that the quality of the engineering project is first rate in terms of its
durability and utility. The project is completed ahead of time and budget.

A fumble means the results of the project are simply unusable or may have failed to materialise.
Indeed, the initial attempts have failed so badly that it takes double the time to complete it,
whereupon it fails or collapses!


Gambling (INT+POW)
The ability to understand and play games of chance, including calculating odds, keeping one’s
composure under high stakes and noticing when someone is cheating or when a game has
been rigged.




58


      A critical success with gambling allows the Adventurer to win a game even if it has been rigged
to the highest degree. In terms of calculating or assessing odds of success, the Adventurer will be
infallibly accurate in his assessment.

If the result is a fumble, then the Adventurer has utterly misread the circumstances, signals and
other indicators surrounding the game. He loses everything save the shirt on his back (unless he
was stupid enough to stake that too).


Healing (INT+POW)
This includes a number of advanced cures and restorative abilities, including surgery, developing
antidotes to poisons and remedying diseases. Use of this skill will always require a healer’s kit (see
page 114). Each use of the Healing skill generally takes 1D3x10 minutes to perform.

Curing Diseases: A successful Healing test allows a patient under the effect of a disease to add a
bonus to his next opposed Resilience versus Potency test to resist the disease, equal to the critical
value of the skill.

Curing Poisons: A successful Healing test allows a patient under the effect of a poison to attempt a
second opposed Resilience versus Potency test, with the patient gaining a bonus to his Resilience
test equal to the critical value of the skill.

For a critical success in treating diseases and poisons, the patient gains a bonus to his Resilience
test equal to the healer’s Healing skill divided by 5.

If the roll is fumbled, the remedy weakens the patient’s ability to fight the cause of the affliction;
all Resilience tests are at -10% penalty.

Surgery: Surgery is the only way, other than magical healing, that an Adventurer may recover
from a Major Wound. Once a successful First Aid test has been made to stabilise a Major Wound
(see page 50), a successful Healing test can attempt to set broken bones, stitch flesh together and
restore the location so that it is on the road to recovery. As long as the Healing test is a success,
the stricken location will begin to heal normally (see Natural Healing on page 86).

Surgery can re-attach a severed limb but this will not make it usable once more.

Critical success in surgery indicates that the patient gains a Hit Point due to the superior quality
of the healing. Reattached limbs will heal at half the normal rate described under Natural
Healing on page 86.

If the roll is fumbled the affected location remains permanently maimed and never recovers any
Hit Points.


Language (INT+CHA)
Like the Lore skill, the Language skill is actually several separate skills grouped under a single
heading. Language (English), Language (German) and Language (French) are all individual
skills.




60

         Every Adventurer with a Language skill of 50% or more is fluent in that language, though they
will likely bear an accent if it is not their native tongue.

Civilised cultures are more likely than other cultures to have developed literacy although this
does not mean that every barbarian or nomad culture, for example, has no written form of its
language. It is therefore up to the Games Master to decide if fluency in a language also includes
the ability to read and write it, depending on the nature and circumstances of the campaign. If
the Games Master wishes the literacy percentage of the Adventurer’s language may be higher or
lower than the spoken skill, in which case an appropriate bonus or penalty can be applied to the
base Language skill.

If the Adventurer scores a critical success he has achieved a superb grasp of the language. He gains
a bonus equal to his Language critical score for any tests involving communication of personal
credibility.

On a fumble the Adventurer has completely misunderstood or mangled the nuances of the
language. All immediate Skill Tests involving communication and personal credibility suffer a
penalty.


Lore (INT x2)
This skill is used in the same way as the Lore skill described on page 52. The Advanced range of
possibilities for this skill is limited only by a player’s imagination but a list of potential areas of
Lore study are listed here:

Alchemy, art, astronomy, gambling, geography, heraldry, law, logistics, military tactics, mineral,
philosophy, poisons, theology.


Mechanisms (DEX+INT)
This covers an Adventurer’s ability to both assemble and disassemble mechanical devices,
including traps and locks. Mechanisms generally involve delicate contraptions with small
working parts, as opposed to Engineering, which deals with massive constructions.

Picking a lock or disassembling a trap usually takes at least one minute to perform, while larger
devices will take longer.

Usually, an Adventurer will simply make a Mechanisms test in order to succeed at assembling
or disassembling a device, with appropriate bonuses or penalties decided upon by the Games
Master. However, if a device has been designed to specifically resist attempts at disassembly, the
Mechanisms test becomes opposed by the Mechanisms skill of the Adventurer who created it.

On a critical success the Adventurer achieves success in half the usual time and with flawless
results.

On a fumble the mechanism is broken and requires the attention of its maker to fix properly.




                                                                                                       61

      Meditation (POW x2)
The use of Meditation helps to focus concentration and is psychically soothing. Meditation is a
skill that must be learned either by study or practice. A successfully meditating Adventurer may
recover lost Magic Points at twice the normal rate. Meditating Adventurers retain full awareness
of their surroundings and may make Perception tests at no penalty.

On a critical success the Adventurer triples the rate of Magic Point recovery.

Fumbling increases the Adventurer’s Fatigue by one level as unwanted thoughts intrude on the
psyche.


Oratory (POW+CHA)
This skill is used when addressing large groups of people, such as a priest addressing the faithful
or a general exhorting his troops to victory on the eve of a battle. In effect, it is much like
Influence, save that it relies more upon emotional appeal than intellectual stimulation and is
used for larger groups of people.

On a critical success the Adventurer wins over the audience completely and utterly, gaining their
vociferous agreement. He gains a bonus equal to the critical score of his Oratory skill for all
immediate tests concerning communication and personal credibility.

If fumbled the Adventurer’s arguments come across as shallow and ill-communicated - even
insulting. He gains a penalty equal to the critical score of his Oratory skill for all immediate tests
concerning communication and personal credibility.


Play Instrument (DEX+CHA)
Like the Lore skill, the Play Instrument skill is actually several separate skills grouped under
a single heading. Play Instrument (Dulcimer), Play Instrument (Flute) and Play Instrument
(Spoons) are all individual skills. A successful test with this skill will result in the audience being
pleased by the Adventurer’s performance.

On a critical success the music produced is of stunning emotional quality. If being used as part of
an Influence test, to impress a prospective client or ally perhaps, then the Influence test receives
a bonus of +40 plus the critical score for the Play Instrument skill.

For a fumble the music is discordant and unpleasant to listen to. If being used as part of an
Influence test, to impress a prospective client or ally perhaps, then the Influence test receives a
penalty appropriate to the circumstances.


Seduction (INT+CHA)
Seduction combines charm, flirtatiousness, tenacity and cunning. This skill allows the Adventurer
to completely win-over the target of the seduction attempt using overt romantic or sexual signals,
leading to the target becoming deeply enthralled to the Adventurer and willing to perform one
suggested service or command. The target may try to resist a seduction attempt with an opposed
Persistence test.




62

         Shiphandling (INT+CON)
This skill is used in the same way as Boating but is instead applied to waterborne craft that are
driven by sail or rows of oars.

A critical Shiphandling success increases the Movement rate for the craft by half again.

If the test is fumbled, reduce the craft’s Movement by half


Streetwise (POW+CHA)
In some ways, this skill could be considered the urban version of Survival. Rather than helping
the Adventurer find food and water, however, this skill allows him to find other things he might
need in an urban setting. Streetwise allows an Adventurer to find fences for stolen goods, black
markets and general information. Such uses of Streetwise normally require a minimum of 1D4
hours.

A critical success allows the Adventurer to find what he is looking for 1D2 hours, rather than
usual 1D4.

A fumbled Streetwise means the Adventurer makes some mistake that causes insult or offence,
attracting the attention of undesirables who may wish to cause him harm. The Games Master
should decide on the specifics according to the circumstances.


Survival (POW+CON)
This is a broad skill, used whenever the Adventurer has to rely on his own wits to survive outside
the comforts of civilisation.

One Survival test will be required every day that an Adventurer lacks either food, water or a safe
place to sleep. Success indicates the Adventurer manages to find whatever he is lacking - failure
means he will go without which, over several days, could result in very serious consequences.
Survival tests are not used when the Adventurer is in a city or town.

Survival tests may be required in other circumstances as well, such as hunting or gathering food
for other Adventurers or attempting to locate the best place in the local terrain to permit a group
to rest for an extended period.

On a critical success the Adventurer has been able to weather the conditions for a number of days
equal to half his critical score in Survival (rounded up) without needing to make any further tests
against Resilience, for instance.

On a fumble the Adventurer has done something that causes immediate harm. A Resilience test
is required immediately. If failed, the Adventurer suffers 1D3 points of damage to a random
location and the Games Master should adjudicate the specifics according to the circumstances
of the environment.


Teaching (INT+CHA)
The Adventurer is skilled in the instruction, coaching and tutoring of others. The skill does
not work in the same way as other skills. When teaching someone else the teacher’s skill acts
as a bonus to the Improvement Roll for his pupil, as described in the section on Adventurer
Advancement beginning on page 68.



                                                                                                   63

      Track (INT+CON)
With this skill an Adventurer can locate the tracks (footprints, disturbed vegetation and so on) of
a specific creature and follow them. A test must be made to locate the trail and then again once
every hour they are being followed. Modifiers will be imposed depending on what terrain the
trail is across (following footprints in the sand is Easy while doing the same across hard cobbles is
Formidable), how long ago the tracks were made and whether anything has been done to cover
them (either deliberately or via the weather).

With a critical Track test the Adventurer will not need to make any further Track tests in pursuit
of the quarry and is able to anticipate and follow the trail without difficulty.

For a fumble the trail is completely lost and cannot be recovered.


Magical Skills
The magical skills here are distinct from Common Magic and apply to the specific magical paths
of Divine Magic and Sorcery. These styles use a combination of two skills to govern how magic
works - both the power of spells and their casting. A more thorough explanation of how the
skills work can be found in the respective magic chapters but a summary of each skill follows:


Lore (Specific Theology) (INT+POW)
This is the knowledge and understanding of one’s cult or religion; its history, myths and context
in the world. The skill allows the Adventurer to call upon miracles or magic from his deity and
is used in casting Divine Spells (see the Divine Magic chapter).

Critical success - The Divine Spell is not lost when cast and can be cast again.

Fumble - The spell does not work but is also lost and must be regained as if it had been
successfully cast.


Pact (Specific Cult or Deity) (CHA + Dedicated POW)
This is a measure of one’s devotion to a Divine cult (see the Divine Magic chapter) and its object
of veneration. The higher the Pact skill, the more dedicated the follower. Dedicating POW to
a Divine cult automatically creates the Pact at a base percentage equal to: CHA+Dedicated
POW. It is not a measure of how much an Adventurer knows about the cult or god; that is still
measured by the Lore (Specific Theology) skill. Pacts are further explained in the Cults chapter.

If a critical success is rolled when recovering Divine Spells, the Adventurer recovers all the Divine
Spells associated with the Pact simultaneously


If the Pact roll is fumbled then any Divine Spells used cannot be recovered and the Adventurer,
irrespective of his standing in the cult or church, must return to a shrine or temple to pray for
their return.


Sorcery (Grimoire) (INT x2)
Sorcery (Grimoire) is a measure of a sorcerer’s knowledge and intimacy with a particular group
of spells, collectively known as a Grimoire. This skill is the ability of the sorcerer to cast all spells


64

         known to a particular school or church of sorcery; i.e. those held within its Grimoire but also
measures the depth of relationship and arcane standing the sorcerer has achieved within the order.

The sorcerer must have studied and memorised the spell to be cast; he cannot use the Sorcery
skill to cast spells that are not in a grimoire he is familiar with, as represented by the skill. Even if
a sorcerer possesses knowledge of several Grimoires, he is still limited to memorising a maximum
number of spells (including those known from Common Magic) equal to his INT.

The scale of what can be affected by a spell is dependent on the skill in the Sorcery School. The
higher the skill, the greater the effect or the target it can be used against.

To cast a spell, the sorcerer must succeed in a test of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. If the spellcasting
attempt is a critical success, the entire spell costs zero Magic Points irrespective of the number of
manipulations the sorcerer is attempting.

If the spellcasting attempt is fumbled, then the spell does not work and the sorcerer loses the full
Magic Point cost of the spell.


Manipulation (INT+POW)
The Manipulation skill is used to manipulate the components of Magnitude, Combine,
Duration, Range and Target. When manipulating a spell, the Adventurer must choose which of
these components he is manipulating.

Every 10% or fraction thereof of the Manipulation skill allows 1 point of Manipulation to be
assigned to the manipulated component. Sorcerers therefore need to specify, at the moment of
casting, how the points of their Manipulation skill will be used. For example: a sorcerer with
Manipulation of 50% could place three points into Manipulate Duration and two into Range;
or five into a single component.

This skill is not rolled against when spellcasting. Its value merely limits how much the caster may
manipulate a Sorcery spell. However, Sorcery spells cost as many Magic Points to cast, as the
number of manipulation components applied to it; with a minimum cost of 1.




                                                                                                         65

                                                  game system

This chapter provides a series of rules for different in-game circumstances that will face Legend
Adventurers and Games Masters from time-to-time. Some circumstances might be one-offs;
others will be more frequent.


Action and Time
Action takes place in several different timescales, according to the stage of the story and the
nature of the action. A fight, for instance, takes place in Combat Rounds, a detailed timescale
that allows the anatomy of the combat to be played through and its effects applied appropriately.
However, other actions and activities not need to be measured in such a detailed way; searching
a room, for example, might take several minutes and travelling between two towns might take
days. Time is typically abstracted into useful scales that advance the Adventurers’ story, keep
things moving and focus the attention on what is most important. In a fight, for instance, it
is important to know who is hurt, where and how badly, so tracking time at a detailed level is
crucial. However, for travelling between two towns, along a known road with few hazards it is
simply enough to state ‘It takes you three days to get from A to B’.


Time Scales
The key timescales, and what actions and motion can be accomplished, are as follows: Combat
Rounds, Local Time and Strategic Time.

Combat Rounds
Dealt with in more detail in the Combat chapter, a Combat Round represents five seconds of
game time. In a Combat Round an Adventurer can:

1.	   Act a number of times depending on his Combat Actions available.
2.	   Move a distance, usually a number of metres, equal to his Movement score (see page
     92).

Once a Combat Round finishes another might start depending on the state of the combatants,
or time might shift to Local Time (see the following section) to handle things such as first aid
or healing.

Although Combat Rounds are used primarily for measuring fights between Adventurers and their
adversaries, Combat Rounds can be useful for measuring very detailed activities that require a blow-
by-blow resolution. For example, a chase between hunter and hunted can be measured in Combat
Rounds, representing the twists and turns that happen very quickly during any tense pursuit. The
circumstances and tension required will determine when Combat Rounds are used and the rules for
action and movement within the Combat Round, as found on pages 125 to 152, should be used.



66

         Local Time
Local Time is anything from a few minutes to a few hours (but not more than about six hours)
and is used to generally measure specific activities, such as skill usage, that do not require the
detailed attention of a Combat Round but require a specific concentration of effort with a
definite end result. Picking a lock might take five minutes and this is a measure of Local Time.
Observing the patrols made by teams of guards around a castle’s walls might require several hours
but is still a measure of Local Time. Usually, in Local Time, the following occurs:

  1.	   The Adventurer states his intention (Local Time starts).
  2.	   The Games Master assigns how long this takes to accomplish.
  3.	   Any appropriate Skill Tests are made and the results noted.
  4.	   The Games Master communicates the results and the time taken in step 2 passes
        (Local Time ends).

The sequence may then either continue in Local Time, move into Combat Rounds or even go
into Strategic Time (see the following section).

Some examples of Local Time tasks and the typical time required are in given in the Local Time
Table.

Local Time Table
Example Task                                        Time
Attempt a Craft or Lore skill.                      5 minutes to 10 days, depending on
                                                 complexity, tools available and so forth.
Attempt to influence, persuade, or seduce           5 minutes to 6 hours, depending on the
someone.                                            nature of the person being worked on.
Attempt to sway a crowd through oratory.            20 minutes to 6 hours, depending on the
                                                 mood of the crowd.
Pick a lock.                                        1 minute to 1 hour, depending on the
                                                 complexity of the lock.
Search a room thoroughly.                           5 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the
                                                 room’s size.
Observe, note and understand a person or            1 hour to 6 hours.

Pick up a trail and follow it using Tracking.       2 minutes to 2 hours, depending on local
                                                 conditions.
Build a makeshift shelter, raft or similar.         3 to 6 hours.
Forage for food, set snares and so forth.           2 to 4 hours.
Prepare and cook a carcass for eating.              1 to 12 hours, depending on the SIZ of the
                                                 carcass.




                                                                                                  67

      Strategic Time
Strategic Time is measured in days, weeks, months or even years. Detailed events within Strategic
Time do not necessarily need to be described and routine tasks and activities that are generally
covered using Local Time are abstracted and presumed to happen automatically and successfully
(although this, again, depends on the circumstances).

Use Strategic Time for those periods where it is not necessary to know the detail, just the outcome
- ‘You sail for 10 days and reach the port by dawn on the 11th day’. ‘You travel the moors for two
days and spot the village in the distance on the third.’ ‘You spend a week studying the grimoire
but are none the wiser at the end of it.’

Long distances and environmental factors may be important to Strategic Time and may also
have an effect on Local Time and Combat Rounds. The Games Masters’ Chapter offers some
additional guidance on weather conditions and their effects.

Most of the time, Strategic Time will be concerned with how far Adventurers can travel
depending on the mode of transport used. The Strategic Time Travel Table offers examples for
various conditions. The travel times assume a travelling day of around 10 hours with regular
stops for rest, water and food. If Adventurers are desperate and need to increase the distances
given in the Strategic Time Travel Table, then they can effectively double the distance travelled
in the Strategic Time period but gain a level of Fatigue if a Hard (-40%) Resilience roll is not
successfully made. Naturally an appropriate Skill Test (Drive, Ride, Athletics and so on) also
needs to be made to double the distance covered, along with dealing with any hazards that might
need to be resolved in Combat Rounds or Local Time.

Strategic Time Travel Table
Travel Example                                         Distance Covered (kilometres)
Walking                                                30 per Day (10 hours)
Horseback at casual speed                              60 per Day (10 hours)
Wagon at casual speed                                  15 per Day (10 hours)
Open Sea, favourable conditions                        300 (in a 24 hour period)
Open Sea, unfavourable conditions                      36 (in a 24 hour period)
Coast or River, favourable conditions                  60 per Day (10 hours)
Coast or River, unfavourable conditions                32 per Day (10 Hours)


Adventurer Advancement
Legend Adventurers begin the game as callow youths and, through time and game play, may
develop into heroes. They do this by improving the Common and Advanced skills they have,
learning new skills, studying magic, seeking the secrets of Heroic Abilities and by improving
their Characteristics which, in turn, help other Attributes to improve.


Improvement Rolls
Skills and Characteristics are increased through the use of Improvement Rolls, which the Games
Master awards at the close of a particular game session or point in a story. Improvement Rolls
are not given at the end of every game session but are awarded when the action reaches a natural
close and the Adventurers have time to rest, reflect and consolidate what they may have learned
in the time just past.

        Alaric’s Tale
Alaric, Lilina and Thrace have just completed an adventure that saw them sneak into the troll’s lair
in search of evidence for the whereabouts of the troll who killed Alaric’s father. During play all three
Adventurers acted heroically and cleverly to the challenges set before them and so, when they return
to the village, cut, bruised and bloodied, but with important information, the Games Master awards
each Adventurer four Improvement Rolls.

Later…

The game session included a debate held in the Chieftain’s hall that concerned the welfare of the entire
clan. Throughout this important council Alaric, Lilina and Thrace were completely disinterested and
contribute nothing to the proceedings. At the end of the session, the Games Master makes an award of
only two Improvement Rolls explaining that the award would have been higher if the Adventurers had
participated more and learned from their experience.




As a base, each Adventurer should receive three Improvement Rolls when the time comes for
them to be awarded. This can be modified if the Adventurers performed particularly poorly or
heroically and the Games Master should judge how the award should be made: a minimum of
one and a maximum of five Improvement Rolls depending on how the Adventurers acquitted
themselves.

Improvement Roll Modifier
Every Adventurer has an Improvement Roll Modifier, based on the CHA Characteristic, of
between -1 and +1, or more. This represents the relationship an Adventurer has with his
community, peers and colleagues, who offer their services or advice, or, if CHA is particularly
low, the difficulty of attempting to improve one’s capabilities without the assistance of others.

The number of Improvement Rolls an Adventurer has to spend is modified by the value of the
Improvement Roll Modifier. So, in the case of Alaric, his Improvement Roll Modifier is zero. In
the two examples given earlier Alaric would receive four and two Improvement Rolls respectively,
as the Games Master has decided to allocate them.

Lilina, on the other hand, has CHA 16 and therefore an Improvement Roll Modifier of +1.
Lilina is very confident in her personality and this is abstracted in her ability to seek advice, make
use of friends, colleagues and others in her community and make the most of her experiences. In
the two examples earlier she would gain five Improvement Rolls (instead of the four the Games
Master awards) and three Improvement Rolls rather than two.

Conversely Thrace, with a CHA of 5, is a somewhat sullen individual who tends to keep
himself to himself, probably because he lacks confidence socially or because he is, genuinely,
anti-social. This places him at a disadvantage in his development and his Improvement
Roll Modifier of -1means that, in the examples from earlier, he gains only three and one
Improvement Rolls respectively.

Using Improvement Rolls
A player can choose to spend one Improvement Roll to attempt to increase one known skill.



                                                                                                       69

      *	   Select the skill to be increased and roll 1D100. Add the Adventurer’s INT Characteristic to
the result of the 1D100 roll.
*	   If this 1D100 result is greater than the skill’s current score, the skill increases by 1D4+1
points.
*	   If this 1D100 result is equal to or less than the skill’s current score, the skill only increases
by one point.



Alaric’s Tale
Alaric wishes to increase his Athletics, which is currently at 35%. He practises the skill in earnest
and then spends one Improvement Roll.

He rolls 1D100 and results in 29. However, he also adds his INT of 16 and this makes a result
of 45. Since this is greater than the 35% of his current Athletics skill, it is improved by 1D4+1
points. If the result of the 1D100 roll and the addition of his INT had been less than or equal to
35, his Athletics skill would have increased by only one point.



Skills Above 100%
There is no limit to the score a skill can reach; a skill can reach 100% and exceed it. However,
the more adept an Adventurer becomes at any particular skill, the more difficult it becomes for
him to learn something about that skill he did not already know. Thus, as an Adventurer’s skill
percentage climbs, it will become more difficult and time consuming for him to raise that skill.

*	   When an Adventurer wants to improve a skill that exceeds 100%, he only needs to roll
against a target value of 100. However, if his current skill is between 101-200% he only
adds half his INT to the roll.
*	   If the skill is 201-300% he only adds one quarter of his INT to the roll; and, between
301-400% an eighth (and so forth).
*	   If the Adventurer manages to roll over 100, with his INT bonus as outlined above, then
the skill improves by 1d4+1 points. If the result is less than 100 then the Adventurer only
gains 1 point, as usual.

For example Jurgen, a master swordsman, has Sword and Shield at 153% and INT 16. To improve
his Sword and Shield he rolls 1D100 and adds 8 (half his INT) to the result. The roll is 94 and
Jurgen’s INT bonus takes the result to 102 meaning that Jurgen gains a 1D4+1 increase.

Years later, Jurgen’s Sword and Shield has reached a dizzying 203%. To increase it, Jurgen must roll
1D100 and score 100 or more, adding only a quarter of his INT (4) to the roll. The 1D100 roll is 43
and Jurgen’s INT bonus of 4 takes it 47 - nowhere near enough for the skill to increase by 1D4+1%
and so it climbs to just 204%.

Learning New Skills through Improvement Rolls
An Adventurer can learn a new Advanced Skill through spending Improvement Rolls. Two
Improvement Rolls give the Adventurer the Advanced skill at its basic Characteristic-derived score.

Some Advanced skills however, cannot be learned through simply spending Improvement Rolls.
The following Advanced Skills can only be gained through training (see page 72).




70

              *	   Craft
  *	   Culture - if studying a culture completely alien to one’s own.
  *	   Engineering
  *	   Healing
  *	   Language
  *	   Lore (with the exception of Lore (Regional))
  *	   Teaching
  *	   Sorcery and Manipulation

Once learned with the assistance of a teacher, these skills then become improvable using
Improvement Rolls.


Improving Characteristics
Adventurers can gradually improve their Characteristics, becoming more intelligent, stronger
or dextrous over time. Characteristics improve at a much slower rate than skills but can have
more of an effect on an Adventurer. The process of increasing a Characteristic through exercise is
abstracted through spending Improvement Rolls in a similar way to improving a skill - however
the cost to do so is far higher. Improving a Characteristic by one point costs a number of
Improvement Rolls equal to the Characteristic’s current value; hence, improving a Characteristic
from 10 to 11 would cost 10 Improvement Rolls.

Improvement Rolls, when used to improve Characteristics can be stockpiled from one allocation
to the next but the player must state that his Adventurer is using these stockpiled Improvement
Rolls towards a Characteristic increase - and stipulate which Characteristic is to benefit.

For example, Thrace’s player, at the end of a story when the Games Master allocates Improvement
Rolls says that he wants to increase his CHA 5 to CHA 6. It will cost him five Improvement Rolls
to do this and he knows it will take time. Instead of using the two rolls he gains from the story to
enhance skills, he puts them towards his CHA improvement instead. In the next Improvement Roll
allocation he can again choose to put his Improvement Rolls towards increasing his CHA or use
them for skill improvement.

Adventurers can contribute some or all of their Improvement Rolls towards Characteristic
improvement. In Thrace’s example he could contribute one Improvement Roll towards increasing
his CHA and spend another on improving a skill. The choice is his.

When a Characteristic increases, all skills that derive their base scores from it will change
accordingly, as will the Adventurer’s Attributes such as Combat Actions, Strike Ranks and
Damage Modifier. See the summary of Characteristic Changes on pages 11-12.


Improving Skills Through Training
As well as using Improvement Rolls to increase skills, skills can also increase through dedicated
training. For this to occur, the following conditions need to be met:

*	   The Adventurer has sufficient time to dedicate to training - usually a period of Downtime
  (see page 84).
*	   Access to a teacher or mentor, either one-to-one or via a school, academy or cult.
*	   Funds to pay for training.




                                                                                                    71

      An Adventurer cannot continually improve a skill through training: after increasing a skill
by training his next improvement needs to be through an Improvement Roll. Once that
is accomplished, he can then improve that skill through training once more, if he meets the
training conditions.

To achieve any skill increase the Adventurer must spend a week in training and not undertaking
any other activities. At the end of the training period a 1D100 roll is made to see if the Adventurer
has made any headway and, if so, the skill improves. The amount of the improvement depends
on the Adventurer’s ability to learn and the teacher’s ability to teach. Both are explained here.

Teachers and Mentors
Two names for the same thing, anyone can act as a teacher or mentor as long as they have at least
20% more in the skill being taught than the Adventurer.

Teachers also benefit from the Teaching Advanced Skill. Teaching is the ability to train, coach and
mentor to best effect, ensuring the right conditions for learning and cementing the knowledge
conveyed. The value of the Teaching skill provides a bonus to the skill increase for the student.
If the teacher has Teaching, he adds the critical range of the Teaching skill (i.e., one 10th of the
skill’s score) to the Adventurer’s increase - if the Adventurer successfully learns anything from
the time in study.

The Teaching skill also confers two other benefits, as follows:

*	   The teacher can instruct an additional student for every 20% he has in Teaching. Thus, a
teacher with Teaching 60% could teach four students simultaneously.

*	   The teacher can add one silver piece per 1% of Training skill to the standard training cost.

It is not necessary for a teacher to have the Teaching skill but it is clearly an advantage to the
student if it is present.

Training Procedure
To attempt a skill improvement through training the Adventurer spends a week in full time study
with his teacher or mentor. At the end of the week he makes a 1D100 roll and compares it to his
current score in the skill. Only one skill at a time can be increased through training.

*	   If the roll is less than the skill’s current score, the skill increases by 1%. The Adventurer has
not made significant progress through study.

*	   If the roll is equal to, or greater than, the skill’s current score, the skill increases by a number
of points equal to the Adventurer’s INT divided by five (rounded up), plus the teacher’s
Teaching critical range (if the teacher has the Teaching skill).

Learning New Advanced Skills Through Training
The following Advanced Skills can only be learned by an Adventurer if he has a teacher or
mentor to teach him:

        Alaric’s Tale
Alaric is keen to improve his Dance skill in order to impress Selina, the Chieftain’s daughter, at a
forthcoming banquet. His Dance is 23%. Alaric approaches one of his aunts who has Dance 65%
and Teaching at 50%. It will take a week to train Alaric how to dance without looking ungainly
or awkward.

At the end of the week Alaric rolls 1D100 and scores 92. His Dance skill therefore increases by the
following:

Alaric’s INT 16 divided by 5 = 4, plus;
His aunt’s Teaching critical range of 5 (50%/10)

Thus, after a week of hard effort and several crushed toes, Alaric has increased his Dance by a total of
9% taking it to 32%. He is still no expert but is far less clumsy than he was. His aunt suggests that, in
return for her time, Alaric should donate 50 Silver Pieces to the local temple, to show his appreciation.



*	   Craft
*	   Culture - if studying a culture completely alien to one’s own.
*	   Engineering
*	   Healing
*	   Language
*	   Lore (with the exception of Lore (Regional))
*	   Teaching
*	   Sorcery and Manipulation

It takes one month for the Adventurer to emerge with the Advanced Skill at its basic, Characteristic
derived score. From that point on, the skill can then be improved through either Improvement
Rolls or training.

The teacher of the skill must be a professional, i.e. know the skill at 50% or higher.

Learning a new Advanced Skill does not require a 1D100 roll to be successfully made; all that
is necessary is the time and money needed for training. However, if the trainer has the Teaching
skill, the time it takes to learn the new Advanced Skill is reduced by one day for every 10% he
has in Teaching. Thus, in Alaric’s example, if his mentor in Lore (The Thunderer) has Teaching
70%, Alaric would need only 21 days - three weeks - rather than 28 to learn the skill to its
starting level.

Training Costs
The standard costs for training are based on the Adventurer’s current level in the skill and the trainer’s
Teaching skill. The table of costs that follows is a guide only and assumes that the Adventurer
is finding an independent teacher who will offer one-to-one training. Dedicated academies may
charge more or less, depending on reputation and a discount might be offered (5% per additional
student, as a guideline) if a teacher is able to train multiple students at the same time. Remember
that the teacher can add an additional Silver Piece for every 1% of his Teaching skill:




                                                                                                          73

Therefore, an Adventurer wanting to train in his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, currently at 74%, with
a teacher who has Teach 85%, would spend 885 Silver Pieces for a week’s training.

If an Adventurer is a member of a cult or guild that offers training in certain skills related to
its membership, then he often benefits from a discount on training costs. The cult or guild’s
description will specify what skills it trains in, what teachers it has available and what discount
is offered to members. The Training Costs Table is used as the base cost for the training, unless
otherwise specified in the cult or guild’s description.


Ageing
The march of Time is inevitable. Unless an Adventurer is the lucky beneficiary of age-halting
magic, he will get older and the effects of age will tell upon the frame. In Legend the signs of ageing
do not begin until the Adventurer reaches the age of 40. At that point, and for each year thereafter
(the birthday perhaps, or an anniversary agreed between the Games Master and the player), the
Adventurer should make two Skill Tests: one for Resilience and one for Persistence. Each test is at
a penalty equal to the number of years over 40 the Adventurer has attained. Thus, a 50 year old
Adventurer suffers a -10% penalty to the Resilience and Persistence tests. The tests are also further
modified according to the Adventurer’s life experiences, as noted in the following table.

Life Experiences
Life Experience                            Persistence and Resilience Modifiers
Disease or Poisoning                       -10% (Resilience)
Emotional trauma                           -5% (Persistence)
Insanity                                   -10% (Persistence)
Major Wound                                -10% (Resilience)
Resurrected from Death                     -15% (Persistence and Resilience)
Serious Wound                              -5% (Resilience)

Each different life experience is cumulative; so an Adventurer who has been poisoned and
suffered a Major Wound incurs a -20% penalty to his Resilience and Persistence tests. However,




74

         the Adventurer does not suffer from accumulated penalties for the multiple occurrences of the
same experience. Thus, even though an Adventurer may have suffered several Major Wounds, he
only incurs a single -10% penalty.

If the Resilience and/or Persistence test is made successfully, the Adventurer does not incur any
ageing effects that year. If either test fails, the Adventurer must roll on the appropriate, or both,
columns of the Adventurer Ageing Table to determine which Characteristics suffer from the
effects of ageing that year.

Adventurer Ageing Table
       Physical Ageing (Failed                         Mental Ageing (Failed
1D6       Resilience)                                     Persistence)
1-2       STR                                             INT
3-4       CON                                             POW
5-6       DEX                                             CHA

Each Characteristic affected by ageing reduces by 1D2 points. These points can be recovered
through normal Characteristic improvement, as described on page 71, representing efforts
made by the Adventurer to keep themselves trim and alert as they grow older. What specific
debilitating effects arise as part of the ageing process are down to the players and Games Master
to define. Reducing STR or DEX indicates the general wear and tear on the body, for instance,
with creaking joints and a gradual loss of mobility. Reducing INT indicates that age is starting
to play tricks on the mind and memory, whilst reducing CHA indicates that the Adventurer is
getting craggier and more short-tempered, perhaps, as they get older.


Damage
Damage comes from a multitude of sources and the following rules account for the most
common forms that Adventurers will face.




                                                                                                     75

      Acid
What is important here is the dilution of the acid more than its type or source. Acids are
therefore classified as being Weak, Strong or Concentrated. For game purposes Legend assumes
that contact with the acid is significant or sustained, rather than just a droplet or two.

A splash or spray of acid lasts only for a single round before it ceases working. Immersion in a
considerable volume of acid however, inflicts the damage every round until the victim or location
is removed and treated.

            Damage
            per Combat
Acid Type        Round           Treatable With…
Weak             1D2             Water - the residual acid can be washed away by the victim
                            if a source of water, or similar fluid, is available. It takes
                            a minute of washing to remove the acid: whilst being
                            washed away the acid does not inflict any further damage
                            but the victim must focus on treating the affected location
                            with water and cannot undertake any further actions. If
                            he interrupts the washing process he continues to suffer 1
                            point of damage per round until it can be completed.
Strong           1D4             First Aid skill - a successful First Aid roll is required to
                            reduce the acid’s type from Strong to Weak; the victim
                            continues to sustain damage from the acid whilst the First
                            Aid treatment is being made. Thereafter the weak acid
                            can be treated as noted previously. If the First Aid roll is a
                            critical success, then the acid is neutralised without needing
                            further attention.
Concentrated     1D6             Healing skill - a successful Healing roll is needed to reduce
                            the acid’s type from Concentrated to Weak. Thereafter the
                            weak acid can be treated as noted previously. If the Healing
                            roll is a critical success, then the acid is neutralised without
                            needing further attention.

Armour slows the effects of acid but does not stop it. An armoured location has its APs reduced by
the acid’s damage until it reaches zero Hit Points, at which point the damage is then transferred
to the Hit Location that it had been protecting. Armour reduced to zero AP is rendered useless
as the acid burns through bindings, straps and joints.


Asphyxiation/Suffocation/Drowning
If prepared, Adventurers are able to hold their breath for a number of seconds equal to CON x5.

If unprepared (and as the circumstances are too varied to summarise, Games Masters must
determine if an Adventurer is prepared, or able to prepare), the Adventurer must make a
Resilience roll successfully to be able to gasp enough air and retain it without panicking, for
CON x1D4 seconds. If the Resilience roll fails and/or when the Adventurer reaches the point
where he must struggle to breathe, then damage sustained through asphyxiation/suffocation or
drowning is as follows:




76


      Make a (further) Resilience roll.
*	 If the roll is a critical success, the Adventurer takes no damage that round.
*	 If the roll is successful, the Adventurer sustains 1D3 points of damage to the Chest that
round.
*	 If the roll fails, the Adventurer sustains 1D3 points of damage to the Chest and Head that
round.
*	 If the roll is fumbled, the Adventurer sustains 1D6 points of damage to the Chest and Head
that round.

The process continues until the Adventurer is able to breathe normally again or they die.

Adventurers struggling for air can attempt to perform any appropriate skills that circumstances
permit: Swim, for instance, or grapple with a foe holding them in a position where asphyxiation
is occurring. However all such skill attempts are considered to be Hard (-40%).


Disease and Poison
Diseases and poisons take many different forms but for game purposes function in a similar
way. First, the Potency of the disease or poison must be calculated. All diseases and poisons are
rated for Potency between 10 and 100 (or higher). The Potency is then matched against the
appropriate resisting skill (usually Resilience or Persistence) in an opposed test.

*	   If the resisting skill is a success then the effects of the disease or poison are avoided.
*	   If the resisting skill is a failure then the effects of the disease or poison are felt for the
Duration.

Characteristics of Poisons and Diseases
Every disease or poison has a series of Characteristics that govern how it affects the target. The
Characteristics are:

Application: How the poison or disease is administered:

*	   Ingested - The disease or poison is ingested through either eating or drinking.
*	   Inhaled - The disease or poison is inhaled through breathing or snorting.
*	   Contact - The disease or poison is absorbed through skin contact.
*	   Injected - The disease or poison must be injected directly into the body (via a needle, sting
or some other direct means).

Onset time: The time prior to the effects taking hold. Poisons or diseases possessing multiple
Conditions may have different onset times for each one.

Duration: The duration of the poison or disease’s Conditions

Resistance Time: When or how frequently the Adventurer needs to make a Resistance roll to
counter the disease or poison’s effects.

Potency: The disease or poison’s Potency, rated between 10 and 100 (or higher).

Resistance: How the disease or poison is resisted - either Persistence or Resilience, usually, but
another roll may be called for.

Conditions: Every poison or disease has one or more Conditions. These have specific effects as
described in the Conditions table and if a victim fails to resist the poison or disease, he suffers all
the Conditions described. See the Conditions table, following.


78

         Antidote/Cure: If the Adventurer succumbs to the poison or disease’s Conditions, there is still
a chance that an appropriate cure will mitigate the effects. If so, then the remedy will be noted
here. Otherwise all non magical diseases and poisons can be alleviated by specific healing magic,
such as the Cure Disease or Cure Poison spells.
 
Conditions Table
Condition         Effects
               The victim is incapacitated with pain. The affected area, if a location, cannot
Agony             be used for the poison’s duration. If the poison affects the whole body, the
               Adventurer cannot move save to crawl slowly and scream.
               Victim suffers asphyxiation - he collapses, unable to breathe and is
Asphyxiation
               incapacitated. The rules for Asphyxiation, found on page 76, are used.
               Victim suffers a further Hit Point of damage every hour, from each location
Bleeding          currently wounded, or from internal bleeding. Internal bleeding generally
               applies damage to all Hit Locations simultaneously.
Blindness         Victim becomes blind.
Confusion         Victim cannot use any knowledge, communication or magic skill.
Contagious        Victim can transfer the poison or disease by touch.
Deafness          Victim loses his hearing.
               Victim must make a Resistance roll. If the Resistance roll fails then the victim
               dies immediately. If the Resistance roll is successful then all Hit Locations are
               reduced to a negative equivalent of their starting value: the victim then has a
Death
               number of minutes to live equal to his CON Characteristic. It requires either
               the Healing skill or appropriate disease or poison healing magic to stabilise
               the victim.
               Victim’s vocal chords are paralysed, preventing verbal communication or the
Dumbness
               casting of spells.
               Victim gains an extra level of Fatigue, on top of any they are currently
Exhaustion
               suffering from.
               The victim’s body temperature fluctuates wildly - from hot to cold - and
Fever             muscles ache. All skills are halved and the victim also suffers from nausea (see
               the Nausea entry).
               Victim experiences delusions and cannot differentiate between real and
               imaginary experiences. His skills and abilities are unaffected but his ability to
Hallucination
               relate to the real world is seriously impaired and characterised by fear, panic,
               hatred and, in extreme circumstances, irrational violence.
               Victim suffers a permanent loss of one Hit Point in the location(s) affected,
Maiming
               due to necrosis of the injured tissue.
               Victim is driven to follow some compulsion; such as avoid water, paranoia,
Mania             attack companions and so forth. The mania induced by the disease or poison
               will be noted in its description.
               Victim cannot eat and must roll against his Resilience every time he performs
               a stressful physical action to avoid being physically sick. The sickness lasts for
Nausea
               1D3 rounds during which he cannot act and, once it has ended, he suffers a
               level of Fatigue until rested.
Paralysis         Victim is unable to physically move.
Sapping           Victim loses Magic Points based on its potency.
               Victim loses consciousness for a period specified in the disease or poison’s
Unconscious       description. When consciousness is regained the victim suffers a level of
               Fatigue.


                                                                                                    79

      Sample Diseases
These are samples of various diseases encountered during Legend play, to be used as they stand or
as a template for Games Master designed infections.

Creeping Chills
Carried by the dreaded, chaos-tainted beastmen, Creeping Chills is spread by skin contact
although the skin must be broken (through a wound, for instance) for the disease to take hold.
Beastmen sometimes smear their weapons in their own blood, spittle or excrement all of which
harbour the contagion. If contracted Creeping Chills takes 1D4 hours before its effects are felt.
First, the victim feels a chilling numbness through his arms and legs, before this rapidly overtakes
the whole body. As the chills spread, he is rendered partially incapacitated as per the following
description.

Application: Contact
Onset time: 1D4 hours
Duration: 1D6+1 weeks
Resistance Time: Weekly. The first Resistance roll must be made at the end of the Onset Time,
then weekly thereafter. Successfully resisting the disease allows the Adventurer to avoid suffering
the Conditions until the next roll must be made. Thus victims of Creeping Chills often appear
to recover, only to suffer a later relapse.
Potency: 50+ CON of Beastman carrying it.
Resistance: Resilience.
Conditions: Fever. If the Resistance roll fails the victim suffers shivering attacks, muscle ache
and has all skills halved until the disease is cured.
Antidote/Cure: Cure Disease spell. Creeping Chills is a magical disease, meaning that only the
Cure Disease spell can cure it.

Rabies
Carried by certain animals and transferred by a successful bite, rabies works on the brain,
inflaming it and paralysing the throat. Victims begin with flu-like symptoms (muscle pains,
coughing, fever) but within a few days the disease moves into its far more painful - and invariably
fatal - phase.

Application: Contact
Onset time: 2D6 weeks
Duration: 2D6 days
Resistance Time: One Resistance roll
Potency: 80
Resistance: Resilience.
Conditions: Hallucination, Mania (hydrophobia), Death. If the disease takes hold, the victim
suffers increasingly acute and debilitating hallucinations. Halfway through the Duration, manic
hydrophobia automatically sets-in as the victim’s throat swells, the body dehydrates and it
becomes physically painful to swallow water. At the end of the Duration, the victim mercifully
slips into a coma and dies.
Antidote/Cure: Cure Disease spell. Rabies is not a magical disease but its severity means there
is no natural cure or antidote for it; healing magic is essential and must be administered prior to
the conclusion of the disease.




80

         Soul Palsy
Carried by certain supernatural creatures, Soul Palsy deliberately targets the victim’s soul, eroding
Magic Points. The disease is usually contracted through inhaling the demonic breath of the
supernatural monster carrying it.

Application: Inhalation
Onset time: 1D4 days
Duration: 1D6 days
Resistance Time: Daily. The first Resistance roll must be made at the end of the Onset Time,
then daily thereafter.
Potency: 65
Resistance: Persistence.
Conditions: Sapping. The Sapping condition saps 1D6 Magic Points if the daily Resistance roll
is failed.
Antidote/Cure: Either the Cure Disease spell, or by drinking water specially Sanctified by
a Priest of the victim’s cult. The Sanctified water has a Potency of the Priest’s Magic Points
multiplied by five and it reduces the Potency of the Soul Palsy by this amount, either completely
curing the disease or enabling the victim to better resist it.


Sample Poisons
Blade Venom
Blade venom comes from many sources: poisons milked from venomous creatures and
then treated further; toxic plants and herbs; or by alchemy perhaps. Typically blade venom
is a sticky paste that is applied to a blade or spear/arrow head. It must be introduced
through an open wound and once it takes effect, it inflicts a terrible burning pain in the
injured location.

Application: Injection
Onset time: 1D3 Combat Rounds
Duration: 2D6 minutes
Resistance Time: One Resistance roll.
Potency: 55.
Resistance: Resilience.
Conditions: Agony. If the victim fails his Resistance roll the poisoned location is incapacitated
with pain. The effect continues until the Duration is completed.
Antidote/Cure: Each specific blade venom usually has a counteracting agent, such as urine or
yoghurt, which soothes the pain. If the cure is applied successfully before the end of the Onset
time then the blade venom is completely counteracted. Successful use of the Healing skill will
also neutralise the pain.

Potent Snake Venom
This venom is of the kind typically injected by a poisonous snake such as a cobra or similar.
Fangs are used to inject a neurotoxin in a dose sufficient to kill within a few minutes. The
potency of the venom is based on either the quantity injected or the concentration - meaning
that small snakes with quite small venom glands can often introduce a small amount of venom
that is every bit as harmful as a large dose from a larger snake.




                                                                                                     81

      Application: Injection
Onset time: Nausia after 1D3 minutes, Paralysis after 3D6 minutes, Asphyxiation at conclusion
Duration: 1 hour
Resistance Time: The victim must make a Resistance roll at the Onset Time of each stage of the
poison. Failure indicates that Condition has taken effect.
Potency: 80
Resistance: Resilience
Conditions: Nausea, Paralysis, Asphyxiation. The venom initially causes the victim to start
feeling nauseous if the first Resistance roll is failed. The location bitten then suffers paralysis if
the second Resistance roll is failed. At the end of the Duration the victim must succeed in a final
Resistance roll or suffer respiratory failure.
Antidote/Cure: Anti-venom. Some cultures have perfected anti-venom remedies which have a
Potency of 1D20+10. The anti-venom must be introduced with a successful First Aid or Healing
roll and add their Potency as a bonus to the victim’s Resilience roll to fight the venom throughout
its duration.

Sleeping Draught
Application: Ingestion
Onset time: 1D8 minutes
Duration: 2D6 hours
Resistance Time: Hourly. The first Resistance roll must be made at the end of the Onset Time,
then hourly thereafter. Success indicates the victim has woken up but remains groggy for the
remainder of the Duration.
Potency: 75.
Resistance: Resilience.
Conditions: Unconscious. If the victim fails the Resistance roll he falls into a deep sleep remaining
unconscious until he succeeds in resisting the draught, or the Duration expires. The victim awakes
feeling groggy and lethargic, gaining a level of fatigue in addition to any already suffered.
Antidote/Cure: The sap of the foxglove plant can protect against the effects of a sleeping
draught if taken in advance of the poisoning. Otherwise, there is no method save magic that can
counteract the effects.


Falls
Falling can happen for a number of reasons. Failed or fumbled Athletics rolls to climb or jump
often result in falls and Knockback can easily knock an Adventurer off a precipice or over a
parapet. An Adventurer that takes damage from a fall ends up prone. Armour Points do not
reduce falling damage.

Falling Distance
Distance Fallen            Damage Taken
1m or less                 No damage.
2m to 5m                   1D6 points of damage to a random location.
6m to 10m                  2D6 points of damage to two random locations.
11 to 15m                  3D6 points of damage to three random locations.
16m to 20m                 4D6 points of damage to four random locations.
+5m                        +1D6 damage.

A creature of SIZ 8 to 9 treats the distance fallen as one metre less. A creature of SIZ 6 to 7 treats
the distance fallen as three metres less. A creature of SIZ 4 to 5 treats the distance fallen as five


82

         metres less. A creature of SIZ 2 to 3 treats the distance fallen as eight metres less. A creature of
SIZ 1 or less treats the distance fallen as 10 metres less.

As long as the Adventurer was not surprised, they may attempt an Acrobatics test to mitigate
falling damage - a successful test allows the Adventurer to treat the fall as if it were two metres
shorter than it actually is. In addition, as long as this test is a success and the Adventurer is not
reduced to 0 Hit Points in a location due to the fall, the Adventurer lands relatively safely and
is not prone.

Adventurers falling onto soft surfaces (such as thick moss or a hay stack) may treat the distance
they fall as halved for the purposes of damage. The Games Master will decide whether this
applies or not.

Adventurers falling onto damaging surfaces (such as pit spikes or a concrete floor bubbling
with two inches of acid) will suffer the effects of the surface to all locations that are damaged
in the fall.


Falling Objects
A falling object imparts an amount of damage based on its SIZ and the distance of the fall. An
object imparts 1D6 damage for every six points of SIZ (or fraction thereof ), plus an amount of
damage equal to the Damage Taken column of the Falling Distance chart on page 82 - including
any adjustments for objects of smaller size.

For example, an anvil with SIZ 10 inflicts 2D6 damage. If said anvil fell from a height of 10 metres,
it would impart an additional 2D6 damage! If a small rock SIZ 1 was dropped from the same height,
it would inflict 1D6 damage but would gain no extra damage from the fall.


Fire/Cold
Fire and intense heat can come from numerous sources, such as naked flames or super-heated
metal.

An Adventurer normally takes damage from fire or heat to a specific Hit Location. However, if
an Adventurer is immersed in the source of the damage (such as standing within a burning room
or being burned at a stake), then all locations will suffer from the damage the fire causes. The
amount of damage suffered from fire or heat will depend on its intensity, as shown on the Fire
and Heat table. The damage from the heat source is applied every Combat Round until the heat
source is extinguished or removed, or the Adventurer manages to escape from it.

something is cold enough to cause damage, it will cause damage according to its intensity,
just like fire or heat.

Down Time
Down time is the period in between adventures when Adventurer spend their hours relaxing,
training, carousing, researching, or simply getting on with their mundane lives. It is deliberately
not a period that requires a Games Master to invest with any great detail but it can be interesting
and fun to find out what Adventurers have been up to in their down time and, perhaps, use some
of their activities either as the basis for a scenario or to form part of one.


Activities
The Adventurers can get-up to countless activities during Down Time and they do not need to
be specific about them unless they are associated with improving the Adventurer in some way, or
might have a useful implication for further adventures.

If the Games Master (and players) want to know what happens to their adventurers during
Down Time and do not wish to fill in the blanks deliberately, here are some suggestions for
common activities.

Odd Jobs
The Adventurer takes on paid, part-time work using his skills as an Adventurer. The work is
generally non-hazardous and relatively poorly paid. Either choose an odd job or roll randomly.
To see how much the Adventurer earns, either decide how many days are spent in the odd job,
and multiply it by the Payment per Day figure, or roll 1D20 to randomly determine the number
of days.

To see how successful the Adventurer was in the job, roll a second 1D20. If the die roll is a 20,
this indicates that the Adventurer was sacked from the job for some reason and pay was withheld
(or worse). If a 1 is rolled, then the Adventurer performed a sterling service. Double the earnings
from the work.


Cost of Living
When not adventuring, Adventurers have living expenses like everyone else; food, rent, taxes,
socialising and so forth. Of course, how much an Adventurer chooses to spend depends almost
entirely on what they have available to spend. Living luxuriously to one Adventurer may seem
like border-line poverty to another, depending on what Adventurers are used to.

Use the following table as a general guide to living expenses. The terms used are relative to the
amount of money the Adventurer has available: ‘luxury’ to someone with only a few silvers in
their purse might be taking a bath once a week. To someone with several thousand, it might be
taking a bath in ass’s milk every day.

The amount spent on Cost of Living excludes any dues necessary to cults or guilds and are
exclusive of training costs. Neither are the costs of specific weapons, armour or other individual
goods used in adventuring included. As a period of Down Time begins, Adventurers should
declare what standard of living they intend to pursue after having decided on training and
personal improvement activities and paid any dues to cults or other patrons. These costs should
be deducted from each Adventurer’s personal wealth and the remainder used to determine the
standard of living enjoyed for the remainder of the Down Time.



                                                                                                  85

      Encumbrance
Despite their most fervent prayers, Adventurers will be unable to carry every last weapon, piece
of armour and treasure chest they discover. There is a limit to what an Adventurer can carry and
those who exceed this limit will not be able to move very quickly.

Every piece of equipment in the Equipment chapter has an Encumbrance (ENC) score, though
some items are too small or light to have an ENC score. Adventurers can usually ignore the
effects on Encumbrance that these have unless they start carrying a lot of them - assume that
an average of 20 such items will equal 1 ENC, so long as the Adventurer has a suitable means of
carrying them, such as a sack or backpack.

An Adventurer can carry equipment with a total ENC that is less than or equal to his STR+SIZ
without penalty.


Overloading
An Adventurer carrying total ENC greater than his STR+SIZ is Overloaded.

*	   Overloaded Adventurers suffer a -20% penalty to all tests that require physical actions,
including Weapon Skill Tests and most tests that have DEX or STR as a Characteristic
(some exceptions being Sleight and Mechanisms).
*	   Overloaded Adventurers have their Movement halved. They also suffer a -20% penalty to
all Fatigue tests.


Healing
Healing can come from a variety of sources: First Aid and Healing skills are obvious, as is magical
healing in the form of spells: these healing forms are dealt with in their respective descriptions.
However, Adventurers also heal naturally and the rate of natural healing is dependent on the
Adventurer’s Resilience.


Natural Healing
The amount of Hit Points an Adventurer naturally regains is based on the Resilience value, as
shown in the Natural Healing Table:

Natural Healing Table
Resilience Value                            Healing Rate
01-10                                       1 Hit Point per 72 hours
11-30                                       1 Hit Point per 48 hours
31-50                                       1 Hit Point per 36 hours
51-70                                       1 Hit Point per 24 hours
71-90                                       1 Hit Point per 18 hours
91+                                         1 Hit Point per 12 hours




86

         There are certain restrictions on natural healing, as follows:
*	 An Adventurer cannot engage in anything other than light activity: if the Adventurer
 undertakes anything strenuous then the rate of healing is treated as one stage lower on the
 Natural Healing Table thus, an injured Adventurer with Resilience 44% heals at a rate of 1
 Hit Point every 36 hours. If he decided to assist his colleagues in defending the village from
 attack, his Healing Rate would drop to 1 Hit Point every 48 hours, for the duration of the
 time he engages in work related to the village’s defence.

*	   Natural healing will not heal a Major Wound until that location has either been treated
  with a successful Healing test (see page 60) or significant magical healing has been applied.


Magical Healing
However magical healing is achieved, whether from a spell, prayer or potion, it has an
instantaneous effect.

In addition to the restoration of Hit Points, any location suffering a Major Wound that
receives even a single Hit Point’s restorations through magical healing of commensurate power
immediately stops bleeding and can benefit from natural healing.

If an Adventurer has been knocked unconscious due to a Serious or Major Wound, the restoration
of a single Hit Point to the wounded location that caused the unconsciousness will revive them.

Unless specifically stated in the magic’s description, magical healing cannot re-attach severed
limbs or revive the dead.


Hero Points
Hero Points are part of the currency of Legend. Hero Points allow Adventurers to differentiate
themselves from the rank and file, using Hero Points earned to gain an advantage over opponents,
find a way through tricky situations, or mitigate that killing blow that gets through even the best
Adventurer’s defence.

Every Adventurer starts with a fixed number of Hero Points that are used throughout his
adventures and Quests. New Adventurers start the game with two Hero Points and more can be
earned as the game progresses.

At the conclusion of a story, each Adventurer should receive two Hero Points. This can be
modified if the Adventurer performed particularly poorly or heroically, giving a range of between
zero and four Hero Points awarded. However Hero Points need not be reserved for the end of
a story: if an Adventurer performs some action or deed that the Games Master deems especially
heroic, or which significantly adds to the atmosphere or progression of the story, then he can
make an immediate award, at his discretion. Such awards are never a right and cannot be
demanded by players for their Adventurers; they are always the Games Master’s decision. In
these cases ad-hoc awards should be of a single Hero Point and no Adventurer should benefit
from more than one such award per story.




                                                                                                   87

      Alaric’s Tale
In a battle with a group of trolls, Thrace saves the day through a mixture of quick thinking, deft tactics
and mighty thrusts with his long spear. As his initiative saves the lives of Alaric and Lilina, the Games
Master makes him an immediate award of one Hero Point at the end of the combat. At the end of the
story’s session and following more heroics from all three Adventurers, the Games Master awards each
of them two Hero Points.




Using Hero Points
Hero Points can be used in a variety of ways. Each of the following options costs a single Hero
Point. Once spent, a Hero Point is gone forever.

Last Chance Combat Action: If an Adventurer has exhausted his Combat Actions during a fight
and needs to find that last burst of desperate energy to perhaps avoid a messy end, he may spend
a Hero Point to gain a Combat Action.

Second Chance: A player can re-roll any Skill Test that affects his Adventurer. This can be a Skill
Test, damage roll or anything else that has some effect on him. He can even force an opponent
to re-roll an attack or damage roll made against him.

For example Alaric is engaged in an opposed Skill Test with his great rival, Owain. Both are attempting
to impress the fair Selena with their storytelling skills (using Influence). Owain has rolled a critical
success, beating Alaric’s normal success. Alaric thus spends a Hero Point forcing Owain to re-roll his
Influence skill: the re-roll results in a failure for Owain and so Alaric wins the contest and impresses
the giggling Selena through a last minute recollection of the heroic fight against the trolls…

Glancing Blow: An Adventurer who suffers a Major Injury may spend a Hero Point to
downgrade the wound to a Serious Injury. This reduces the damage taken to one Hit Point less
than what would be required to inflict a Major Wound.

Heroic Insight: A Hero Point may be spent to gain a hint or clue from the Games Master that
helps the Adventurer resolve a situation that has him at an impasse.

For example, Alaric is trapped within the troll’s lair and can hear troll guards bearing down on him.
Panicked by the situation, he is truly stuck for what to do next. Alaric spends a Hero Point for a Heroic
Insight: the Games Master smiles and informs Alaric’s player that, suddenly, he feels a vague draft of
air against his cheek that could only have come from the crack of a concealed doorway. This prompts
Alaric to search and he finds the exit just in time. The Heroic Insight has saved his life.

Heroic abilities: The Adventurer may spend Hero Points to acquire a Heroic Ability he has
qualified for. For more details see the Heroic abilities section on page 218.


Fatigue
Adventurers are usually hardy individuals but even the best of them are still just people,
with limits to what they can physically achieve. The greatest warrior in the world may have




88

         phenomenal endurance but even he will not be able to run 10 miles to a besieged village and
then fight for three hours non-stop. As Adventurers engage in strenuous physical activity, they
risk becoming Fatigued.

Physical activity is divided into three categories; light, medium and heavy. The length of time
an Adventurer can engage in physical activity without running the risk of becoming Exhausted
is determined by his CON, as detailed under each category of physical activity. Once this
time has elapsed, an Adventurer must begin to make Skill Tests in order to resist the effects
of exhaustion.

*	   Light Activity: Includes travelling at a reasonable pace, casting spells or carrying light loads.
  Adventurers never risk Fatigue while engaging in light activity.
*	   Medium Activity: Includes back-breaking manual labour, running, climbing or swimming.
  An Adventurer can engage in medium activity for a number of minutes equal to his CON
  before risking Fatigue. Once this time has elapsed, the Adventurer must immediately make
  a Simple (+20%) Athletics test or begin suffering the effects of Fatigue. So long as the
  activity continues, he must make another Simple (+20%) Athletics test every time a number
  of minutes equal to the Adventurer’s CON elapse.
*	   Heavy Activity: Includes fighting in combat, sprinting, swimming and climbing
  at top speed. An Adventurer can engage in heavy activity for a number of Combat
  Actions equal to his CON score before risking Fatigue. Once this time has elapsed, the
  Adventurer must immediately make a Normal (+0%) Athletics test or begin suffering
  the effects of Fatigue. So long as the activity continues, he must make another Normal
  (+0%) Athletics test every time a number of Combat Actions equal to the Adventurer’s
  CON elapse.

Note that some versions of medium or heavy activity may not require Athletics tests. The Games
Master may decide that, in order for an Adventurer to escape Fatigue after a long night in the
Great Library searching for clues, a Persistence test is required instead, as the mental exertion
counts as medium activity.


Effects of Fatigue
If an Adventurer fails a test whilst engaged in medium or heavy activity, he will begin to show
Fatigue. Every time a Fatigue test is failed, the Adventurer will drop down one level of Fatigue,
as shown on the Fatigue Levels table.


Time and Fatigue
Adventurers, regardless of activity, will naturally tire. Once an Adventurer has been awake for
10+CON hours, they must make a Persistence test or drop one Fatigue level. This test must be
repeated for every hour the Adventurer remains awake.


Recovering from Fatigue
An Adventurer will move up one level of Fatigue for every two hours of complete rest or four
hours of light activity. A successful First Aid or Healing test can raise an Adventurer by one level
of Fatigue once per day but cannot raise an Adventurer above Winded.




                                                                                                      89

      Fatigue Levels
Level of Fatigue Effects
Fresh            None.
Winded           All Skill Tests (including further tests to resist Fatigue) suffer a -10%
            penalty.
Tired            All Skill Tests (including further tests to resist Fatigue) suffer a -20%
            penalty. Movement suffers a -1m penalty.
Wearied          All Skill Tests (including further tests to resist Fatigue) suffer a -30%
            penalty. Movement suffers a -1m penalty. Strike Rank suffers a -2 penalty.
Exhausted        All Skill Tests (including further tests to resist Fatigue) suffer a -40%
            penalty. Movement is halved. Strike Rank suffers a -4 penalty. DEX
            is considered 5 points lower for the purposes of determining Combat
            Actions.

              Adventurer must make a Persistence test every minute or fall unconscious
              for 1D3x2 hours.
Debilitated        All Skill Tests (including further tests to resist Fatigue) suffer a -50%
              penalty. Movement is halved. Strike Rank suffers a -6 penalty. DEX is
              considered 10 points lower for the purposes of determining Combat
              Actions.

              Adventurer must make a Difficult Persistence test every Combat Round or
              fall unconscious for 1D6x2 hours.


Exposure, Starvation and Thirst
Freezing cold wastes or crippling hot deserts can take a terrible toll on Adventurers, as can hunger
and thirst.

Exposure occurs when an Adventurer is insufficiently prepared against a hostile environment,
normally because of a failed Survival test. An Adventurer can normally survive for a number of
hours equal to his CON before suffering from exposure, although this can change according to
weather conditions.

An Adventurer can survive for a number of days equal to his CON before becoming incapacitated
from starvation, though after three days they will begin to suffer a -10% penalty to Fatigue tests.

An Adventurer can survive for a number of hours equal to his CON x4 before becoming chronically
thirsty, though particularly arid environments may reduce this to CON x3 or even CON x2.

Whenever an Adventurer is suffering from exposure, starvation or thirst, the Fatigue test penalty
immediately doubles to -20%. In addition, the Adventurer will automatically suffer one point
of damage to all locations every day, for every condition he is experiencing. Natural or magical
healing will not heal this damage - only sufficient shelter, food or water can remedy the problem
and allow natural or magical healing to take place.


Abstract Fatigue
The standard Fatigue rules aim for a balance between realism and ease of play. However, at the
Games Master’s discretion, they can be still further simplified for players who find keeping track
of elapsed rounds almost as tiresome as armed combat.

90

         The Games Master can simply call for a Simple (+20%) Athletics test after each major exertion
by an Adventurer or antagonist. A major exertion might be: killing a foe, emptying a treasure
chamber, fleeing a foe, withstanding a cavalry charge, mounting an infantry charge, swimming
a rapid river, climbing a castle wall and so on. He should feel free to adjust the rhythm until he
and the players are comfortable - some groups may agree that it takes three kills (or major duels)
to induce a Fatigue test. Other groups may decide that the first kill merits a Simple (+20%)
Athletics test, the second and third a Normal (+0%) Athletics test, the fourth and fifth a Difficult
(-20%) Athletics test and so forth. A rest between combats might ‘reset’ this clock.

The effects of abstract Fatigue are the same as those given in the regular rules.


Inanimate Objects
Like Adventurers, inanimate objects - such as doors, walls, statues and so forth - can also sustain damage.

All inanimate objects have Armour Points and Hit Points. Except for the most unusual of
circumstances, attacks on inanimate objects will automatically hit - Adventurers simply need to
work out how much damage they deal.

The object’s Armour Points will be deducted from any damage dealt as normal, with the
remainder being applied to its Hit Points. Once an object’s Hit Points have been reduced to
zero, it is smashed and useless.

Inanimate objects likely to block or restrain Adventurers, such as doors or ropes, have Armour
and Hit Point scores. To break down a door, or burst one’s bonds, an Adventurer must succeed
with either a Brawn, Unarmed or weapon attack roll, as appropriate. A successful roll deals
damage to the item as per the weapon type; a failed roll has simply failed to apply enough force
or damage to the item to deteriorate its condition. Once the object’s Hit Points reach zero, the
item is broken or sundered. In the cases where Brawn is used (to break a rope, for example), a
successful roll inflicts the same damage as an Unarmed attack.

The Inanimate Objects table gives a range of examples of inanimate objects, along with their
Armour Points and Hit Points.

      Inanimate Objects and Weapons
A weapon is designed to cleave flesh, not stone. Using a weapon on an inanimate object with
Armour Points equal to or greater than that of the weapon, deals damage to both the object and
the weapon. For instance, using a war sword on a boulder will certainly damage the boulder but
the war sword itself will be destroyed long before the boulder is. Certain tools and weapons, such
as the mining pick (see page 115), are designed for use on rock and would not be destroyed if
used on a boulder.

The Games Master should exercise judgement on which weapons or tools can affect which
objects. For example, a warrior with a sword can easily slash through a rope but one armed only
with a maul is likely to have a much harder time.


Movement
Standard human base Movement is eight metres per Combat Round at walking pace. If sprinting,
the Movement rate is multiplied by five; however, an Adventurer can only maintain a sprint for
a number of Combat Rounds equal to his CON before he must test for Fatigue.

The Comparative Movement table summarises typical distances covered, by creatures of differing
base Movement rates, for a variety of time periods.


Movement in Armour
The armour an Adventurer wears acts against the Movement rate and certain kinds of actions
such as swimming or climbing.

Armour Penalty = Total Locations Armoured, divided by five and rounded up. Thus, a full suit of
plate armour (6 AP on seven locations gives an Armour Penalty of 42/5 = -9)

The effects of Armour Penalty on an Adventurer’s Movement are as follows:

*	   Walking or gentle jogging: Armour does not interfere with such movement, although it
can increase the Fatigue level (see page 90).




92

         *	   Sprinting: Multiply the base Movement by five and subtract the Armour Penalty. The result is how
  fast the Adventurer can move during short chases, or when charging. For example, an Adventurer
  wearing full plate armour can sprint or charge at 31 metres per Combat Round.
*	   Swimming: Divide the base Movement by two and subtract the Armour Penalty. If the
  result is zero, the Adventurer cannot move and barely keeps himself afloat. If the Movement
  is negative, then the Adventurer sinks. For example, the Adventurer wearing full plate armour,
  with a -9 penalty, has a Swimming Movement of 4-9 = -5: the Adventurer will sink if he
  attempts to swim in his armour.
*	   Climbing a rough surface (trees, steep hills and so on): The Armour Penalty is
  subtracted from three quarters of the base Movement (six metres per Combat Action
  for human Adventurers). If the result is zero or less, they are too burdened by their
  armour to climb. Thus, our hero in his plate armour cannot climb as his Climbing
  movement is 6-9 = -3.
*	   Climbing a sheer surface (walls, cliff faces and so on): The Armour Penalty is subtracted
  from the base Movement divided by two. As with climbing a rough surface, if the result is
  zero or less, the Adventurer cannot climb.
*	   Jumping: Reduce the distance in metres the Adventurer can jump (see the Athletics skill,
  page 46) by the Armour Penalty divided by two. For standing jumps this impairment is
  halved.

                                                       equipment
Adventuring is a profession like any other and this means that success often relies on good
equipment - not just on what the Adventurer knows or has experienced. This chapter covers
a comprehensive array of different equipment for Adventurers, including weapons and armour
and also items which might, at first glance, offer little practical value but, in the right place and
at the right time, prove to be life-savers.

Games Masters should read through this chapter and decide which items are going to be available
to the Adventurers based on their Cultural Background. The tables listing prices and so forth
offer guidance on availability but it is perfectly possible that a barbarian village has traded with
civilised merchants and therefore come into possession of goods one would not ordinarily find
in a barbarian community. Similarly cultural taboos might forbid or restrict the sale of certain
goods, or shortages in one commodity or another might mean availability is very limited.

Essentially Games Masters are the final arbiter on what equipment Adventurers can buy once
their Adventurers have been created and all that silver is burning a hole in their purses. Just
because this chapter lists something it does not mean that it is available.


Currency
As its default currency, Legend uses coins minted in lead, copper, silver and gold. The standard,
everyday coins are copper and silver, with gold being the preserve of the very wealthy. The names
for coins vary from place-to-place but for ease of economy, coins maintain a similar value and
standard, as follows:

5 Lead Bits (LB) = 1 Copper Penny (CP)
10 Copper Pennies = 1 Silver Piece (SP)
20 Silver Pieces = 1 Gold Crown (GC)


Armour
Armour absorbs weapon damage. Any successful attack must first penetrate an Adventurer’s
armour before it starts reducing Hit Points. This simple fact alone makes armour an essential
for any Adventurer intending to face great peril or deliberately seek out dangerous challenges.
However, armour is not infallible: every piece of armour has certain limitations and weak-spots
and a well-aimed or well-timed blow can bypass armour completely. So a total reliance on armour
- even good metal armour - is perhaps misplaced. For comfort, and as part of its protection, all
armour is considered lined or padded.




94

         Each piece of armour is characterised by the following qualities:

AP: How many Armour Points are given to each location covered by this type of armour. If an
Adventurer is wearing multiple pieces of armour on a location, only the highest Armour Point
score is used.

ENC: The weight and bulk of the armour. See page 86 for more details on Encumbrance and
its effects on Adventurers.

Locations: Which Hit Locations this type of armour protects.

Cost: The average cost in Silver Pieces to purchase this armour.


Armour Effects on Strike Rank and Movement
The more and/or heavier, the armour worn, the more restricted and slower an Adventurer is
likely to be in combat. Total the APs for each armoured location and divide the result by five,
rounding up. The result is the Armour Penalty applied to the Adventurer’s Strike Rank.

For example a chainmail shirt covers three locations for 5 AP per location. This gives a total of 15
AP which, divided by five, gives an Armour Penalty of -3. A full suit of plate mail, covering seven
locations at 6 AP has a total of 42 AP which, divided by 5 and rounded up, gives an Armour Penalty
of -9. In combat these penalties would reduce the Strike Rank of the wearers.

The same Armour Penalty is applied to various types of Movement, such as swimming or
climbing. If these penalties are too great, then the Adventurer may find themselves unable to
perform such actions (see page 92).


Effects of SIZ on Armour
Armour made for an Adventurer of SIZ 1 to 5 will have its cost and ENC halved from that
shown on the Armour table. Adventurers of SIZ 21 or higher will double the cost and ENC for
armour made for them.


Armour Types
Soft Leather: Armour made from cured hides - the simplest form of armour usually found
amongst primitive cultures but also worn in more cultivated styles where protection is important
but not necessarily an essential.

Hard Leather: Strengthened hides and cured leather used for shields and body armour. Hard
leather is the consistency of shoe leather: hard wearing yet flexible.

Linen Cuirass: Similar to a heavy leather cuirass but the armour is crafted from multiple layers
of quilted linen. The thick, stiff fabric provides decent protection at a fraction of the weight of
other materials

Ringmail: Bronze or iron rings sewn onto a leather backing. Heavier than leather but affords
much better protection.




                                                                                                    95

      Scalemail: Similar to Ringmail but the rings are replaced with scales of metal that overlap, like
the scales of a fish or serpent.

Chainmail: Woven metal links which, whilst heavy, are flexible and more durable than armour
relying on a leather base.

Plate: Made of moulded individual metal plates, this armour provides excellent protection but
is encumbering and comes with a heavy price tag.

Armour Types and Costs
Armour                 AP       ENC      Cost in Silver per Hit Location
Soft Leather           1        1        50
Hard Leather           2        2        100
Linen                  2        1        75
Ringmail               3        2        200
Scalemail              4        2        250
Chainmail              5        3        400
Plate                  6        3        1,200

Thus, a full suit of plate, covering all seven Hit Locations, would cost 8,400 SP. A full suit of
Hard Leather costs 700.

However armour does not need to be bought as a full suit: different pieces can be mixed and
matched, although nobles, especially, delight in wearing crafted armour of one type. The
coverage offered by different armour types and styles is summarised in the Armour Pieces table:

      Clothing
This section is a collection of outfits and special items of clothing that are available from place-to-
place. Unlike common goods, many of these items are very self-explanatory. The way someone is
dressed can modify Influence rolls in certain situations. Being well dressed may offer a bonus when
trying to convince poorer folk, or may bring a penalty when negotiating your way past bandits.

         Weaponry
It would be unthinkable for an Adventurer to set out into danger without the means to protect
himself. For many Adventurers a sword or dagger suffices but many soldiers, skilled in a variety
of weapons, know that different weapons have different applications and that a sword, whilst
good against one type of foe, is completely useless against another.

The assortment of weapons - Close and Ranged Combat - is extensive. Each weapon is described
and the description provides any additional effects a weapon might have in a particular situation.


Close Combat Weapons
Each Close Combat weapon is characterised by the following qualities:

Category: The type of weapon this is.

Damage Dice: The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack.

STR/DEX: The minimum STR and DEX scores needed to easily wield this weapon. For every
point a Characteristic is below these minimums, a -5% penalty is applied to a Adventurer’s skill
when attacking and parrying with this weapon.

Size: Each weapon possesses a size rating. This is related to its mass, leverage and stability.
The value is used to determine both the weapon’s ability to inflict and parry damage. The size
categories are Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Huge (H) and Enormous (E).

Reach: The weapon’s length, how far it can reach in combat (see page 139). The size categories
are Touch (T), Short (S), Medium (M), Long (L) and Very Long (VL).

Combat Manoeuvres: The Combat Manoeuvres (see the Combat chapter) a weapon can inflict
- such as Bashing, Impale and so forth.

ENC: The weight and bulk of the weapon. See page 86 for more details on Encumbrance and
its effects on Adventurers.

AP/HP: The Armour Points and Hit Points possessed by the weapon. When Hit Points reach 0,
the weapon is broken and useless.

Cost: The average cost in silver pieces to purchase this weapon.


Close Combat Weapon Descriptions
Ball and Chain: This heavy metal ball attached to a short length of chain is notoriously difficult
to parry. An opponent attempting to parry this weapon treats his parrying weapon or shield as
one step smaller for the purposes of blocking damage. However, the wielder also suffers the same
penalty when trying to Parry with the ball and chain.

Battleaxe: A single-bladed weapon with a sturdy haft, the battleaxe may be used with one or two
hands, depending on the wielder’s preference. A battleaxe can be used to bash through doors and
obstacles rather quickly. It suffers no damage when attacking inanimate wooden objects.




                                                                                                  101

       Buckler: This small, round shield is held in the hand and used to ‘punch block’ incoming blows.
Bucklers are often used to attack with the off-hand, when the main weapon is tied up. Its small
size however, provides little protection against larger weapons or missile fire.

Chain: This two metre length of chain is one step above using an improvised weapon. It is very
difficult to parry, any weapon interposed against a chain is treated as one step smaller for the
purpose of blocking damage. However, the wielder also suffers the same penalty when parrying
with this weapon. If an opponent is caught by surprise, it can also be used as a garrotte.

Club: Perhaps the simplest of all weapons and almost certainly the oldest, the club is simply a
long, stout piece of wood used to bludgeon others. However, there are several cultures that have
carved clubs made of stone, or bone - all of which can be sculpted or decorated according to the
wielder’s preference.

Dagger: Essentially a large knife attached to a short handle, the dagger is often carried as a backup
or parrying weapon. Thieves, assassins and bandits often enjoy the use of daggers because they can
be hidden and drawn with ease. Daggers are usually well-balanced enough to throw effectively.

Dirk: This is a short-handled, wide-bladed weapon about half-again the size of a dagger. It is
commonly used as a secondary weapon, even though it promises sufficient damage any time its
blade bites flesh. Parrying with a dirk increases the damage blocked by one step (i.e. it is treated
as a Medium weapon when parrying).

Falchion: A single edged, cleaver-like sword that delivers heavy, chopping blows.

Garrotte: An assassin’s weapon, the garrotte is a cord, chain or thin braided metal wire used to
loop around a target’s neck and strangle him. Only usable during a grapple or from behind on an
unsuspecting victim, the garrotte inflicts its damage each and every Combat Action the wielder
continues to actively crush his victim’s throat. Whilst being strangled, the victim can attempt to
wrestle free, or damage his opponent so badly they are forced to let go - but acts at a penalty due
to the strangler being directly behind him.

Great Axe: Up to two metres in length, dwarfing the battleaxe in size, the great axe may be either
single or double-bladed and must be used with both hands. It also suffers no damage when used
to break inanimate wooden objects.

Great Club: Little more than a massive branch of wood banded in metal, a great club is much
less a designed weapon and more a makeshift one. Some cultures might create their own varieties
of other materials but overall the great club is the weapon of choice for low-intelligence, low-
resource beings of massive strength and size.

Great Hammer: The great hammer, or maul, is an enormous weapon that deals impressive
bludgeoning damage. It is a tool as well as a weapon and can sometimes be found with a pick-
like spike on the back portion of its head. Great hammers may be used on inanimate objects
without being destroyed.

Great Sword: This group nomenclature pertains to a number of massive blades that can be
found as much as two metres in length. They are used by those warriors who want the enemy
at more than arm’s length, or cleaved beneath the sheering power of the weapon’s strike. Part of
the blade is unsharpened and leather-bound on many great swords, allowing the wielder to grip
them for more effective parries.


102

         Halberd: An axe head combined with a thrusting tip and a hook, mounted on a spear shaft,
the halberd is a multi-purpose weapon. Halberdiers are versatile opponents that can bring any
version of the weapon’s attack to bear in an instant.

Hatchet: A simple and cheap one-handed cleaving tool, the hatchet is essentially a smaller
version of an axe. It can be used to cut through wooden inanimate objects with no risk to its
edge. A hatchet is usually well-balanced enough to throw effectively and many users prefer to
call these items ‘throwing axes’.

Heater Shield: A medium sized shield designed for both mounted and foot use. Most are
reinforced with metal edging and commonly have some form of symbol or insignia painted on
the outside face. Heater shields can parry ranged weapons.

Hoplite Shield: Large circular shields designed for foot combat, which are edged and sometimes
faced with metal. This shield is an excellent defence against even two handed weapons and
provides decent cover against missile attacks.

Kite Shield: Kite shields are large shields with an inverted teardrop shape. This shield can switch
between both infantry and mounted use and is extremely popular for those who spend time in
both types of combats. Kite shields are also effective against ranged weapons.

Knife: Knives can be made from a sharp piece of metal, stone, bone or even glass. They almost
always have a short hilt carved from wood. More commonly a tool than a weapon, the knife is a
multi-purpose item that should be found in every Adventurer’s backpack.

Lance: An oversized spear designed to be used from the back of a mount, a lance can be a
devastating weapon when charging. A mounted character who uses a lance during a charge may
add his mount’s Damage Modifier instead of his own to the damage.

Long Spear: The long spear is a lengthy piercing weapon with a wide bladed head, often used in
ranked units to defeat charging cavalry.

Longsword: The longsword is a versatile sword with an elongated grip, which allows it to be
wielded with either one hand or two. Its extra length adds to its reach and used two handed, it
inflicts greater damage.

Mace: The mace is comprised of a large flanged or knobbed weight mounted on one end of
a haft, which is often reinforced with metal. Its ability to incapacitate, even heavily armoured
opponents, makes this a popular weapon in civilised cultures.

Main Gauche: Also called a ‘parrying dagger’, the main gauche is a long-bladed dagger with two
extremely long and strong quillions. It is normally used in the off-hand in conjunction with a
longsword, rapier or sabre. Parrying with a main gauche increases the damage blocked by one
step (i.e. it is treated as a Medium weapon when parrying).

Military Flail: This is a heavy metal ball or rod, usually bristling with spikes or edged flanges,
attached to a wooden haft by a short length of chain. Due to its flexible construction, an
opponent defending against this weapon treats his parrying weapon or shield as one step smaller
for the purposes of blocking damage. However, the wielder also suffers the same penalty when
trying to Parry with the flail.



                                                                                                   103

       Military Pick: Also known as a war hammer, a military pick is a short shafted weapon that has
a metal head with a hammer face on one side and a curved pick on the other. The military pick
is designed to pierce heavy armour but can also be used on inanimate objects without being
destroyed.

Morningstar: Carved from a length of wood nearly a metre long, the morningstar is a bladed
or spiked cudgel.

Net: Used by gladiators, huntsmen and watchmen, the net is more than a mere fishing net to be
tossed at a target. A fighter’s net is made of thick cord and leather, tipped with numerous hooks
and heavy weights. It can be swung like a flail, the weights lashing out to batter an opponent,
inflicting the damage listed.

Poleaxe: A polearm about the height of a man, it is has a hammer head backed with a metal
spike and a spear tip for thrusting. This style of two handed war hammer, is very popular against
heavy armour types.

Poniard: This duellist’s weapon is a long dagger, designed to be thrust into a target.

Quarterstaff: A simple staff, sometimes banded with metal at either end. In the hands of a
skilled user, it is a fast and effective weapon for both offence and defence and can be hidden in
plain sight as a shepherd’s hook or simple traveller’s walking staff.

Rapier: Fast and light, the rapier relies more on the thrust than the slash. It is a particularly
effective weapon, especially considering its reach.

Sabre: The sabre is a slightly curved sword, designed to be used for slashing or thrusting when
mounted. It has a basket hilt which adds one Armour Point to the limb being used to wield it.

Scimitar: A broad-bladed sword, the scimitar has a dramatically curved edge designed for cutting
and slashing. It is sometimes wider than a normal sheath can hold and is more often hung from
straps or some form of netting.

Shortspear: Heftier than a javelin and fitted with a broader head made for stabbing; a short spear
is commonly used in conjunction with a shield. The short spear is a popular and ubiquitous
weapon, being cheap to manufacture and having a reach advantage over most other single
handed weapons.

Shortsword: The shortsword is a straight, broad-bladed sword designed for thrusting. It does
carry an edge along its sides but use of the edge is always secondary to the thrusting point.

Target: A medium sized, round shield made of wood and covered with hide. A target mounts
a long spike on its central boss, making the shield a dangerous weapon, as well as being able to
parry ranged weapons.

Trident: Another tool turned weapon, a trident is a three-pronged or bladed spear that once was
used to catch fish in the same way as a harpoon. If a trident impales, its barbed prongs do an extra
point of damage when being ripped free.

War Sword: The most common sword type available, the war sword is generally slightly less than
a metre in length and possesses a sharpened tip to thrust with. It is the ubiquitous weapon of
choice amongst many Adventurers.

         Ranged Combat Weapons
Just as Close Combat weapons are defined by certain qualities, so are Ranged weapons.

Category: The type of weapon this is. This is used as a basis for Combat Styles.

Damage Dice: The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack.

Range: This is the effective range of the weapon. The maximum range a weapon can be fired or
thrown is twice this score.

Load: This shows how many Combat Actions are required to load or reload the weapon.

STR/DEX: The minimum STR and DEX scores needed to easily wield this weapon. For every
point a Characteristic is below these minimums, a -5% penalty is applied to an Adventurer’s skill
when attacking with this weapon.

Size: Each ranged weapon possesses a size rating. In the case of projectile weapons, this does
not relate to the firing weapon itself but rather to how ‘forceful’ its ammunition is. The value is
used to determine whether the weapon can overcome any shield which may parry it. The size
categories are Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Huge (H) and Enormous (E).

Combat Manoeuvres: Any specific Combat Manoeuvres applicable to the weapon or its
ammunition.

ENC: The weight and bulk of the weapon. See page 86 for more details on Encumbrance and
its effects on Adventurers.

AP/HP: The Armour Points and Hit Points possessed by the weapon. When Hit Points reach
zero, the weapon is broken and useless.

Cost: The average cost in Silver Pieces to purchase this weapon.

Ranged Combat Weapon Descriptions
Arbalest: This is a metal-armed crossbow that when stood on its end is as tall as a man. It fires
specially crafted arbalest bolts that have been reinforced in order to withstand the sheer force
that its braided cord propels them at. Able to drive a finger-thick bolt a full hand’s depth into an
oak tree, the arbalest hits with force enough to punch through armour as if it were thin cloth but
requires the use of a windlass to re-cock it. An Adventurer’s Damage Modifier is never applied
when he is using an arbalest.

Blowgun: This is a hollow tube or pipe, usually made of wood or bone, which expels a tiny dart
when its user blows on one end. As the dart itself is capable of negligible damage, blowguns are
seldom used without some kind of poison. An Adventurer’s Damage Modifier is never applied
when he is using a blowgun. If fired at someone wearing more protection than normal clothing,
it requires the Combat Manoeuvre of either Bypass Armour or Choose Location to strike flesh.

Bolas: A thrown weapon comprising of two or more weights tied together with lengths of cord.
Whirled and released, the bolas works by entangling its target in the cords and inflicts damage
from the winding weights. Unlike other Ranged weapons, the bolas cannot be parried by shields.
It may only be evaded.

       Dart: A dart resembles an arrow with a longer head and shorter shaft (usually slightly less than
half a metre in length). Darts are rarely a warrior’s weapon and are found in the hands of small
game huntsmen and roguish Adventurers.

Discus: A discus is a flat disc made of stone or metal. Hurling the discus is an old sport and show
of physical prowess. However, someone who is good enough with a discus could easily split skin
and shatter bone with a forceful throw.

Heavy Crossbow: Similar in concept to the light crossbow, this version is larger and reinforced
with metal bands to handle the immense pull of the string. Many heavy crossbows come with a
metal stirrup so the firer can use his foot for leverage, or a crank to pull back the thick string. An
Adventurer’s Damage Modifier is never applied when he is using a heavy crossbow.

Javelin: The javelin is a spear-like weapon with a narrow, pointed head designed for throwing
short distances. The thrower of a javelin may use Pin Weapon as a Combat Manoeuvre, against a
parrying shield. In this circumstance, the pinned shield cannot be used until the javelin has been
removed (which takes one round).

Light Crossbow: A simple mechanical bow, the light crossbow often sees service in small armies
that lack training in other types of Ranged weapons. It can be clutched in one hand and reloaded
with the other, making it a good infantryman’s weapon. An Adventurer’s Damage Modifier is
never applied when he is using a light crossbow.

Long Bow: A long bow has a shaft as much as two metres in length and is designed to be fired
on foot. A long bow cannot be used from horseback.

Net: A net can be hurled at an opponent within five metres. Due to its engulfing size, a thrown
net may only be evaded, not parried.

Recurve Bow: A recurve, or composite bow is made from a laminated combination of wood,
sinew, horn and sometimes even bone. When strung the bow’s forward-angled arms give it a
distinctive shape, allowing it to be as strong as a long bow but without the length. Recurve bows
are mainly used by mounted archers and nomads, since the reduced size means that it does not
catch on the mount that it is fired from.

Short Bow: Designed to be fired from horseback, the short bow is equally useful as a foot
soldier’s weapon. It is a good hunting tool as well as a weapon of war and when used to hunt deer
and smaller game animals it can make all the difference.

Sling: A sling is a long strip of cloth or leather used to fling a stone or bullet at a target. It is as
lethal as a bow, able to injure or kill those wearing heavy armour. Many slings also have a sewn-in
leather cup or pad in which to hold the projectile while gathering velocity. A sling’s range makes
it useful against archers.

Staff Sling: A simple sling mounted on the end of a wooden haft, the staff sling is used by
whipping the shaft overhead to cast its load. Although it cannot match the sling for range, it can
be used to throw heavier stones or burning jars of oil (or other noxious substances) in high arcs
over walls and fortifications. When not being used as a sling, the leather cup and cord can be
wound around the haft and lashed down, effectively turning the staff sling into a quarterstaff.

Trident: See entry in Close Combat Weapons.

Ranged Weapon Ammunition
The following table lists specific types of ammunition, how sturdy they might be, whether they
weigh enough to have an ENC score and their cost. Please note that unless an entry has a (#)
after its name, the price listed is for a single item.

Arbalest bolts: Made of metal-shod hardwood roughly as thick as a man’s thumb, arbalest bolts
are tipped with heavy metal heads that resemble a stiletto or dagger. They use small fletching
from waxy-feathered fowl and are remarkably accurate, if only due to the sheer force with which
they are fired.

Arrows, Bodkin: These arrows are the most commonly used ammunition in Legend. They
possess narrow spikes for points. While not as simple to make as sling bullets, they are far more
popular for their multiple utilities.



                                                                                                 109

       Arrow, Broadhead: While a normal arrow can cause quite a wound, these arrows have broad
cutting surfaces that inflict greater damage, at the expense of range. Using a broadhead arrow
reduces the distance it can be fired by 25% but inflicts an extra two points of damage on
unarmoured opponents.

Arrow, Fishing: More of a tool than a weapon, the fishing arrow is a thin-headed arrow that has
a set of three small barbs facing backwards to catch and hold a wriggling fish. It also has almost
no fletching at all (it interferes with underwater propulsion) but rather a small metal ring onto
which cord or twine can be tied to retrieve a shot fish. Using fishing arrows to catch fish grants a
+10% bonus to Survival Skill Tests.

Arrow, Signal: Not made for combat at all, signal arrows have a hollow head bored out in the same
fashion as a shrilling whistle. When fired (preferably upward into the air) the arrow corkscrews and
emits a distinct and piercing wail that can be heard on a clear day for up to five kilometres. If actually
fired at a target, the arrow has a -20% penalty to hit and will cause half damage if successful.

Blowgun Darts: Blowgun darts are small, thin needles or stubby miniature arrowheads that
often have a tuft of down or cotton at the end in order to catch the rush of air in a blowgun. They
are not designed to do damage but can deliver a single dose of poison to a target quite easily - if
the firer can manage to bypass his armour, of course.

Crossbow Bolts: Simple and stout, bolts are miniature arrows with smaller fletching designed
to carry the bolt on existing force rather than keep it aloft. They tend to have thinner, more
compact heads of metal on them to drive deeper with the impact but some have the wider
hunting heads commonly seen on arrows. Bolts tend to be thicker than arrows and are purchased
to fit a specific type of crossbow - wrist, light, medium or heavy.

Sling Bullets: Stone or lead ovals that can reach surprising speeds and accuracy when hurled by a
skilled user. Bullets can be retrieved rather easily and most can even be hammered or rolled back
into a usable shape with little effort (as lead becomes soft when heated slightly).

Using Ranged Weapons in Close Combat
Just as Close Combat weapons are not designed to be thrown, so most Ranged weapons are not
generally designed to be used in Close Combat. Sometimes, however, Adventurers will be left
with no option but to club someone with a crossbow butt or stab an enemy with an arrow…

If used in Close Combat, a projectile weapon or its ammunition is usually treated as an improvised
weapon. Use the most applicable combat skill the Adventurer has but apply a -2 modifier to any
damage rolled, reflecting the inappropriate use of the weapon.

         Food and Lodging
Merchants, explorers and Adventurers can rarely expect to sleep in their own beds every night
if, indeed, they possess homes. The following therefore illustrate the cost of living for those who

General Items
The following items, whilst billed as general, cover a range of specifics as well as day-to-day
adventuring needs. Some are more useful than others but resourceful Adventurers will be able to
find a use for just about any of the items listed in the following General Items table.

Each item has a description noting any specifics or game effects. The Cultures column notes
which Cultural Backgrounds are most likely to have access to the item - although this is offered
as a guideline only. If an item has no ENC value, it is light enough to be negligible when carried.

          hunters to attract prey, or by scouts to communicate
          signals to one another in non-verbal ways, animal
          calls are seldom larger than a hand’s span in size. Any
          Adventurer using an animal call to hunt can add
          +10% to his Survival skill for hunting purposes.

          allowing for an additional 5 ENC of equipment
          to be strapped to the sides of the backpack as well,

        inanimate objects without being destroyed.
Healer’s kit Stocked with bandages, mortar and pestle,                All          1     150 SP
        poultices, barber’s tools, basic surgical equipment

        Adventurer to use the Healing skill.
Hourglass This specially blown tube of curved glass set into          Civilised    1     20 SP
        a wooden or brass frame is filled with fine sand
        that takes exactly an hour’s time to pass through.
        Fragile and easily disturbed, the hourglass is an
        important piece of equipment for alchemists and
        mages, who need to keep track of reaction and
        application times for future notation and possible
        adjustments.
Ladder, rope Made of rope with rope or wooden rungs (increase         Barbarian,   4     2 SP
3m           ENC to 5 for wooden rungs), a rope ladder                Civilised,

        clear illumination for a three metre radius. It
        will burn for two hours on a flask of oil.
Lantern,     A cowled lantern is a smaller lantern that is always     Civilised    1     12 SP
cowled       made from bronze and brass with a stiff leather
        hood that pulls back from its one main opening.
        Inside the cowled lantern is a ring of polished
        mirrors that reflect the light of the burning oil into
        a focused beam that comes out of the opening
        when the hood is pulled back. The beam of light
        from a cowled lantern extends 10 metres but is only
        a metre wide. It will burn for one hour on a flask
        of oil.

Lantern,    An extremely delicate and decorative lantern            Civilised    1     14 SP
hanging     made of coloured paper and thin wood, a hanging
         lantern is used to cast a dim but pleasing glow to
         a large area. The coloured light from a hanging
         lantern provides hazy illumination up to a four
         metre radius. It will burn for three hours on a flask
         of oil.
Lock picks An item no self-respecting thief would ever be           Civilised    —     75 SP
         without, lock picks allow an Adventurer to use
         his Mechanisms skill to pick a lock. The Games
         Master may assign penalties or bonuses to this test
         based upon the specific circumstances.
Magnifying Whether mounted on a handle or in a pair of wire         Civilised    —     10 SP
Lens        frames to be worn as spectacles, this specifically
         shaped piece of ground glass is used to magnify
         writing, symbols or other tiny clues. While
         looking through the lens at anything within a
         distance of one metre, the Adventurer gets a +25%
         bonus to Perception. However, he suffers a -15%
         penalty to Perception tests concerning everywhere
         else. Also, a magnifying lens held still and fed
         sufficient light from the sun or other remarkable
         source can create a heat source that will ignite
         flammable objects.
Milling     This is a handheld pair of grinding stones that         All          2     8 SP
Stone       can be loaded with spices, grains and minerals to
         be turned to powder. Milling stones are helpful
         for alchemists, healers, shamans and magicians
         to have a source for their various and sundry
         ingredients while on the road. The grinding
         process takes less than a few minutes for most
         substances but could take hours for gemstones or
         other extremely dense materials.
Mining pick A mining pick allows its user to chip his way           Barbarian,   1     35 SP
         through rock (albeit slowly). If used as a weapon,      Civilised
         it is considered a club (wielded with a -20%

instrument   around 70 SP (for a flute, lute or equivalent, for
        example). Larger and better quality instruments
        cost multiples of 70 SP. For example, a good
        quality lute would costs 140 SP and a reasonable
        quality cello or bass horn would cost the same.
Net, fishing This is a two metre by two metre weighted net of        All          4     10 SP
        woven fibres designed to be dropped into standing
        or running water to catch fish, crustaceans and
        the like, for food. It takes 3D10 minutes to use
        the net properly but adds a +25% bonus to the
        Adventurer’s Survival skill for the purposes of
        catching food in this way.
Oar,         A hinged piece of metal with a wide wooden              Barbarian,   2     5 SP
collapsible end that snaps open to a half-metre length, the          Civilised,
        collapsible oar gives a +5% to Boating due to its       Nomad
        lightweight and expertly crafted design. When
        used in combat, the collapsible oar acts as a club
        (with a -10% penalty).
Oil, flask   A single flask of oil is enough to fuel a basic         Barbarian,   1     1 SP
        lantern for two hours, or, if broken on the ground      Civilised,
        and ignited, enough to sustain a small fire for         Nomad

        glass bottles but can also occasionally be found
        in waxed leather skins. A skin cannot be ‘broken’
        as mentioned previously - either on purpose or
        accidentally.
Oil, Jellied Mixing sawdust, chalk or hoof shavings into             Barbarian,   2     10 SP
        common lamp oil slowly over a period of time can        Civilised,
        eventually create a combustible jelly that is very      Nomad
        useful for smearing on torches and other objects
        that are to be set alight at a later time. A single
        spark will light jellied oil on fire and it will then
        burn as if it were a common flask of oil. After it
        has been smeared onto something, jellied oil stays
        combustible for up to a week before it begins to
        lose its potency.

         thin and is made primarily from the rendered          Nomad
         fat and oils from fish or whales. It is relatively
         odourless and carries with it only a very slight
         yellowish tint. It is only slightly more flammable
         than cooking oils and a single bottle of it can
         upkeep dozens of weapons for weeks at a time.
         Any blade treated with weapon oil after it has been
         used in combat will not suffer from mundane rust
         or tarnish for a week or so.
Papyrus,    A papyrus sheet is a sheet of thin, brittle paper     Civilised    —     5 CP
sheet       useful for taking notes, drawing maps or even
         making a rubbing of a raised surface. It is
         painstakingly made from papyrus reeds and
         is considered a luxury item by most common
         people. A sheet of papyrus is square, half a metre
         by half a metre. Once written on, a papyrus sheet
         can be ‘waxed’ to make the ink water resistant
         and smear-proof, though this also makes the sheet
         more flammable should it ever be exposed to an
         open flame.
Pole, 3m    A long pole serves many useful purposes to an         All          1     1 SP

         ground ahead of him, to functioning as a crude

Quiver      Quivers can generally hold up to 30 arrows or         All          —     2 SP
         crossbow bolts.
Razor,      The mainstay of any barber’s tools, the folding       Civilised    —     3 SP
folding     razor is the best implement to painstakingly
         remove three day old stubble. Useful for a variety
         of reasons, the razor can also be used to inflict
         rather nasty wounds on bare flesh - inflicting 1D3
         damage upon scoring a hit on an unarmoured Hit
         Location. Armour of any kind stops this damage
         completely and dulls the blade considerably. Apart
         from the damage, a folding razor has the same
         statistics as a dagger.

        silken rope is superior to braided hemp in nearly
        every way. Like its more common cousin it comes
        in 10 metre lengths but can support 60 ENC or
        60 SIZ, or any combination thereof. Silken rope
        requires more knots to make it usable for climbing
        purposes, shortening it by four metres.

        enough strokes back and forth, the hand saw can
        cut through wood at a rate of 1D4 Hit Points per
        round - ignoring AP from the wooden object.
        If used as a makeshift weapon it can be used as a
        crude short sword (with a -15% penalty) but will
        likely never be usable as a saw again.
Scythe       Primarily a tool for harvesting grain, a scythe can     Barbarian,   2     30 SP
        be put to work as a weapon when necessary. If           Civilised
        used as a weapon, it is considered a bill (wielded

Seal         Often built into jewellery, such as a ring or           Barbarian,   —     100 SP
        necklace, seals are carved with an identifying crest    Civilised,
        or mark representing its owner. These are used to       Nomad
        press wax to close letters, scrolls or other similar
        objects. Recognising a specific family, guild or cult
        seal requires a Lore (Regional) Skill Test (modified

Spade        This is a small shovel, sometimes with a                Barbarian,   1     25 SP

        human-sized people dry. It is not exceptionally         Nomad

           it does not inflict normal damage - instead, it
           inflicts 1D4 fire damage and a fumble or critical

Bit and      This is a short piece of leather or metal that is placed in the   1     15 SP
Bridle       mouth of a mount and attached to a set of leather or chain

          not having a bit and bridle on a mount when an Adventurer
          Critically Fumbles one of these tests can be catastrophic (at
          the Games Master’s discretion).
Crop         The crop is a piece of wood, bone or metal with a folded          —     15 SP
          leather strap at the end. It is used to force a mount to push
          harder. Spurring movement with the stinging and noisy
          ‘crack’ of a crop on the hindquarters of a ridden mount can
          sometimes bring higher speeds. In game terms this allows
          a rider to make an additional Riding Skill Test to increase
          speed, though he can only do so three turns in a row before
          the mount becomes numb or angry.
Driver’s     A length of thin and flexible wood tipped with a long, thin       —     25 SP
whip         piece of resin-coated cord or braided leather, a driver’s whip
          is used to sting the flanks of drawing mounts from the
          driver’s bench of a wagon, coach or cart. It is used to bring
          higher speeds out of the entire team. In game terms this
          allows a driver to make an additional Driving Skill Test to
          increase speed but he can only do so a number of turns in a
          row equal to the number of drawing mounts attached to the
          vehicle before the team becomes inured.
Falconer’s   This kit includes a thick leather glove or gauntlet with cord     1     30 SP
Kit          sewn to it in order to tether a falcon or hunting hawk when
          at rest. It also includes a leather or wooden hood that fits
          over the eyes and ears of the bird in an effort to keep the
          animal calm before releasing it to perform its duties. Anyone
          attempting to perform Craft (Falconry) Skill Tests without a
          full falconer’s kit suffers a -10% penalty to his Skill Test.
Feed/mount Whether it is a supply of corn mash and oats for a stallion,        1     5 CP
rations (per sardines for a sea lion or osprey, or chunks of raw horsemeat
day)         for a griffon, this category covers the road rations needed
          to keep a mount healthy and strong. If they do not pack
          additional feed, Adventurers will need to make additional
          Survival or Tracking rolls every week in order to keep their
          mounts from becoming sickly or unruly.

Goad          A thick-hafted piece of ivory, bone or wood tipped with a      1       25 SP
         rounded hook and jabbing pinion, a goad is like a riding
         crop for thicker-skinned beasts, such as reptiles, pachyderms,
         rhinos and the like.
Saddle,       A specialised saddle designed for beasts with wings like           3   100 SP
flight        griffons and sky bulls, this is a must for aerial cavalry. The
         flight saddle has additional thigh stirrups that keep a rider
         tethered to the animal as it flies. The straps are difficult to
         unlatch when in motion - requiring a Mechanisms roll at
         +10% to do so in combat.
Saddle, pack This is basically a riding saddle with two sets of attached 5           65 SP
        saddlebags and an additional wooden cage for goods where
        a rider would normally sit. The pack saddle can carry an
        impressive 40 ENC of weight but leaves no room for a rider.
Saddle,       This is the most common form of leather saddle and is the          3   60 SP
riding        style that most riders prefer for long trips. Even though it
         does not offer any sort of bonus to Riding Skill Tests, riding
         a horse at anything faster than a brisk walk without one
         imposes a -10% penalty to Riding.
Saddle, war   The heaviest of saddles, a war saddle has a raised front horn      4   90 SP
         and padded back in order to support an armoured rider and
         several additional buckles to attach to barding. Using a war
         saddle inflicts one level of Fatigue per full eight hours of use
         but it does add +10% to any Riding Skill Tests made during
         combat, or when resisting knockback.
Saddlebag     A pair of canvas, leather or cloth bags designed to be draped      2   20 SP
         over the shoulders or flanks of a mount in order for it to
         carry more equipment or goods for the owner. A saddlebag
         can carry 15 ENC worth of weight.
Shoes, horse Common metal shoes nailed to the bottom of hoofed             1         10 SP
        animals, ‘horse’ shoes are designed to keep sharp stones and
        gravel from chipping or splitting a hoof. Hoofed mounts
        that do not have shoes will need to be rested more frequently
        in order to remove detritus, imposing a -10% penalty to
        travel times through any type of rocky or stony terrain.

         combat
Combat is an inevitable part of Legend. Violence, whether it is a squabble descending into
fisticuffs between childhood rivals, a drunken bar-room brawl, or a duel to the death between
mortal enemies, is handled using these rules.

Legend combat has certain hallmarks that are worth bearing in mind; these are as follows:

*	   Combat is a deadly business, irrespective of an Adventurer’s level of skill. A well-placed blow
  can take down the hardest or best armoured Adventurer.
*	   Combat is tactical. Good tactical decisions or choices can greatly influence the outcome of
  a battle. The combat rules are designed to support tactical options.
*	   Combat should be fun. Although it deals with violence - and does so seriously - there is little like
  a good, well orchestrated melee to get the pulse racing and the adrenalin flowing.
*	   Legend combat aims to be cinematic. What is meant here is that melees and ranged combat
  can emulate the feats seen in television and movies - be they dashing, swashbuckling duels;
  gritty, bloody one-on-one combats, or large-scale, epic stand-offs between heroes. The
  combat rules are designed to handle all such confrontations.



Alaric’s Tale
Alaric, Thrace and Lilina have penetrated the underground layer of the troll Illsa Skessa, the troll
Alaric believes was responsible for his father’s murder. Creeping through the narrow tunnels of the
underground complex the three companions emerge into a large cavern which, the frail light of their
torches shows, is filled with debris, discarded bones from eagerly devoured troll-meals and, over in a
corner, slowly roasting something they have captured, a group of goblin guards. The goblins look up
and squint as torch-light falls over them; hands fall to nearby weapons. Alaric, Thrace and Lilina are
in no mood to run but are eager for a fight.

Combat is about to commence…



Components of Combat
Most combats consist of very similar components using very similar timeframes. These
components are as follows:


Combat Skills and Styles
Combat skills are purchased as styles. Learning the style ‘Broadsword and Shield’ costs the same
skill points as learning ‘Greataxe’, thus avoiding the necessity of having to train each weapon
in a combination separately. Alaric, for example, has the Combat Style ‘Spear and Shield’; this


                                                                                                         123

       Combat Style combines the techniques of spear attack and shield defence but does not cost
Alaric two separate skills to gain - they are trained together.

There is a myriad range of different Combat Styles and Adventurers can create their own
combinations to mirror personal preferences, cultural fighting styles or professional requirements.
Some typical examples are:

Sword and Shield (any one-handed sword and any shield type); Mace and Shield; Sword and Dagger
(any one-handed sword coupled with a dagger which is used for parrying but may also be used for attack);
Two-Handed Sword (a large sword requiring two hands to stabilise but inflicting greater damage).

In situations where the user of a ‘two weapon’ or a ‘weapon and shield’ Combat Style is unable,
for whatever reason, to utilise part of the combination, then the wielder’s skill is unchanged but
he does lose the advantage of having two weapons or the defensive capabilities of his shield.

Adventurers trying to decide what sort of Combat Style to select should consider the following:
 
*	 Two handed weapons normally grant an advantage in both inflicting and parrying damage
and give the user a greater reach (see Weapon Reach).
*	 Shields allow the user an extra Combat Action per round, as well as protecting against
missile attacks - which most other weapons cannot parry.
*	 Using two weapons simultaneously also permits the wielder an extra Combat Action per
round and maintains their effectiveness if one weapon is pinned, entangled or dropped.
Secondary off hand weapons must be one size category smaller than the main weapon,
unless both are small.
*	 One handed weapon styles do not give an extra Combat Action, but allows one hand free
for casting Sorcery spells and touch-range spells.
*	 Unarmed Combat Styles have few direct benefits save that the user is always able to fight
and protect themselves when lacking a weapon and can freely combine unarmed attacks
with any other combat style at no penalty (as long as the opponent is within reach). An
unarmed attack can be made with any part of the body, except for the torso. Thus limbs,
wings, tails and even the head can be used.

Missing Weapons: An Adventurer who is missing some of the weapons for his Combat Style
does not suffer any further penalties. For example, if Alaric is forced to use his Spear and Shield
Combat Style when he lacks a shield, he loses the protection of the shield and the bonus Combat
Action from having an off-hand weapon but there is no penalty to his skill.

Substituting Weapons: AnAdventurer can use weapons other than the ones he specialises in but
at a penalty. Firstly, any weapons used must be of the same type as those he normally uses in his
Combat Style. For example, an Adventurer can substitute a short sword for a long sword but
not a mace for a longsword as the mace is used as a bludgeon, not a cutting edge. Secondly, the
Combat Style skill is penalised as follows:
*	 -10% for using a different weapon.
*	 -10% for each Size category difference between the two weapons.
*	 -10% for each Reach category difference between the two weapons.
*	 -5% for each point of ENC difference between the two weapons.

These penalties cannot take an Adventurer below his base STR+DEX attack skill.

For example, if Alaric were forced to use a Longspear instead of his preferred shortspear, he
would suffer a penalty as follows:

124

         *	 -10% for using a different weapon.
*	 -10% for the Size difference (shortspears are Medium, Longspears are Large).
*	 -10% for the Reach difference (Long vs Very Long).
*	 No penalty for ENC, as they both weigh the same.
For a total penalty of -30%.


Combat Rounds
Since fights in Legend often involve a large number of Skill Tests for attacks, parries and such
like, combat is divided into rounds to ease book keeping. Each round represents a period of
five seconds during which time Adventurers can perform their full number of Combat Actions.

Each Combat Round begins with the participant (Adventurer, adversary or monster) with the
highest initiative acting first, spending one of his Combat Actions. This is followed by whoever
has the next highest initiative and so forth until the participant with the lowest initiative has
acted. Then, if anyone still has any Combat Actions remaining, the cycle repeats until all
available Combat Actions for all available participants have been spent. At this point the round
ends. If the participants are prepared to continue fighting, a new round begins; if they withdraw
from combat or cannot continue to fight, actions revert to Local Time and the combat is over.



Alaric’s Tale
The goblin guards are some metres distant from Alaric, Thrace and Lilana but it is clear that a fight
is likely. ‘What are you going to do?’ The Games Master asks each player. ‘We ready our weapons and
prepare to fight,’ Alaric’s player says and the others agree. ‘Okay,’ the Games Master replies and reaches
for a sheet of paper to start recording initiative, hits, damage and other combat information, ‘we’re
moving to Combat Rounds; five second bursts measured by Combat Actions. Everybody ready? Good…
Initiative rolls please…’



Initiative
Who acts first and the order of action is crucial in combat. Initiative is the method of determining
in which order the participants act. Initiative is measured in Strike Ranks and rolled at the start
of a fight, remaining in play unless something occurs to force Initiative to be re-rolled. This is
up to the Games Master to decide but at the very minimum an Initiative roll lasts for an entire
Combat Round.

Calculating Initiative
To calculate Initiative, each participant rolls 1D10 and adds his Strike Rank. The highest result
acts first, followed by the next highest and so on. If two participants tie scores, then they act
simultaneously. If both are attacking simultaneously, a weapon being used to strike cannot also
be used to parry a simultaneous blow.

Armour Penalty
Strike Rank Penalty = (Totalled Armour Points worn on all locations) divided by five.

As discussed on page 92 Armour has a negative impact on Initiative; the heavier the protection
worn, the bigger the hindrance to moving and reacting quickly. An Adventurer’s Strike Rank is
reduced by one fifth of the totalled value of AP worn on all locations (rounded up).


                                                                                                          125

       Alaric’s Tale
The Games Master has called for Initiative. This means Alaric, Thrace and Lilina must roll 1D10,
add their Strike Rank score and then apply any modifications for armour. Here are the core results of
the Initiative Rolls:

Alaric rolls 6. Strike Rank of 15 means he has a total Strike Rank of 21.
Thrace rolls 1. Strike Rank of 12 means he has a total Strike Rank of 13.
Lilana rolls 10. Strike Rank of 14 means she has a total Strike Rank of 24.

The Games Master treats all the goblins as having the same Strike Rank of 12; he rolls 3, so the goblins
have Strike Rank 15. However, armour needs to be factored into all of this.

Alaric wears soft leather (2 AP) across four Hit Locations for a total of 8 AP. Dividing this by five and
rounding up gives Alaric a -2 Armour Penalty, so his Strike Rank is reduced to 19.

Thrace wears similar armour to Alaric and so he, too, has a -2 Armour Penalty, bringing his Strike
Rank down to 11.

Lilana wears her grandmother’s leather breastplate, greaves and vambraces, plus her bronze, plumed
helmet. Her armour totals 16 AP which, divided by five and rounded up gives a -4 Armour Penalty;
her Strike Rank is reduced to 20.

The goblins wear a few scraps of armour that create just a -1 Armour Penalty. Their Strike Rank
becomes 14.

With Strike Ranks calculated and adjusted for armour, the order of combat is thus:

Strike Rank 20	       Lilana
Strike Rank 19	       Alaric
Strike Rank 14	       Goblins (three of them)
Strike Rank 11	       Thrace

Each round of combat proceeds in this order unless something happens that causes Initiative to be
calculated again.



For example a full suit of chainmail armour with a closed helm (36 points in total) creates a -8 Strike
Rank penalty.


Movement in Combat
In a Combat Round, an Adventurer may move up to his standard Movement allowance. This
movement is divided across all of the Adventurer’s Combat Actions. Each Combat Action may
include all, some or none of the Adventurer’s remaining Movement in addition to an attack or
other action. For example, an Adventurer with a Movement of 8m and 3CA could:
1st Combat Action: Move 3m, make an Attack
2nd Combat Action: Move 1m, make an Attack
3rd Combat Action: Move 4m, make an Attack or



126

         1st Combat Action: Move 0m, make an Attack
2nd Combat Action: Move 0m, make an Attack
3rd Combat Action: Move 8m, make an Attack.

The total amount moved may not exceed the Adventurer’s Movement (except when Sprinting).


Combat Actions
Combat Actions (CA), calculated during Adventurer Creation, are used when attempting any
kind of activity during a combat; for example, to attack, defend, change engagement distance,
cast spells and so forth.

When a Combat Action is spent, it is gone; Adventurers therefore need to assess how they use CA
according to the nature of the opponent and the odds being faced.

How an Adventurer’s Combat Actions are used is completely up to the player, who may be as
aggressive or defensive as he wishes When combined with Initiative, CA take on a dynamic
nature; since how they are used can depend on the order of when one acts in the round.

For example, Alaric is forced into a fight. He has 3 CA and has rolled a better Initiative than his
opponent. Going first he decides to attack and the foe succeeds in parrying. Both have used one CA
for that round. Then it is the opponent’s turn and he counter-attacks, forcing Alaric to parry. Now
both have used two CAs. Since the lowest Initiative has been reached but both combatants still have
a Combat Action remaining; the GM cycles back to the highest Initiative again - allowing Alaric to
attack a second time that round. His opponent again parries the blow and the round ends, since both
foes have no more Combat Actions remaining. Thus going first allowed Alaric to use his CA to attack
twice and parry once.
 
The following are activities an Adventurer can attempt by spending one Combat Action during
their turn. Cast Spell, Evade and Parry are special in that they can be used at any time during the
Combat Round as a reaction to an incoming threat.
 
*	 Attack: The Adventurer can attempt to strike with a hand-to-hand weapon or fire a missile
   at an opponent.
*	 Cast Spell: The Adventurer can attempt to cast a spell.
*	 Change Distance: The Adventurer can attempt to change the range at which he is fighting,
   either closing with his opponent or putting distance between them (see Closing and
   Disengaging on page 139).
*	 Change Stance: The Adventurer can shift from standing to prone or vice versa and anything
   in between.
*	 Delay: The Adventurer may pause to assess the tactical situation. This changes his Strike
   Rank to the number when he finally does act. If no action is taken before Strike Rank
   reaches zero, then the Combat Action is lost.
*	 Do Nothing: An Adventurer can decide to simply spend his Combat Action doing nothing
   useful.
*	 Evade: Adventurers can attempt to dive or roll clear of missiles or a charging attack. This
   action can also be declared in advance of an anticipated attack (see Parry). The CA available
   on the character’s next Strike Rank following an Evade attempt cannot be used to make an
   Attack. This penalty carries over to a new round if the Adventurer uses his last available CA
   in a round to Evade.




                                                                                                   127

       *	 Mount/Dismount: The Adventurer can mount or dismount a riding beast.
*	 Move: If unengaged, tthe Adventurer may move his full movement rate.
*	 Outmanoeuvre: The Adventurer can engage multiple opponents in a group Opposed Test
of Evade skills. Those who fail to beat his roll cannot attack him that Combat Round. See
the section on Outmanoeuvre on page 137.
*	   Parry: The Adventurer can attempt to deflect an incoming attack. As well as being a reactive
response, this action can also be declared in advance of an expected attack by adopting a
defensive stance. However, once committed, the CA cannot be converted back to any other
type of action and is lost if not used before his next Strike Rank occurs.
*	   Ready Weapon: The Adventurer may draw, sheath or reload a weapon. Dropping a weapon
costs no CA. However retrieving a dropped weapon within reach costs two CA: one to
retrieve the weapon and a second to return to a readied stance.



Alaric’s Tale
Alaric has three Combat Actions whilst Thrace and Lilina have 2 CA each - as do the three goblins.
Thus, Alaric has a slight edge over his opponents.




Weapon Size and Reach
Every weapon possesses two ratings, Size and Reach. These are used to determine both the
weapon’s ability to parry damage and its reach in combat. The size categories are Small, Medium,
Large, Huge, and Enormous. Further sizes are beyond the scope of mere mortal encounters. The
reach categories are Touch, Short, Medium, Long and Very Long.

The Equipment chapter provides more information on sizes, along with the reach categories for
each weapon in Legend. However, as a simple guide, use the following to calculate which size
category a weapon belongs to.
 
*	 Small - Human unarmed combat and light single handed weapons less than a kilo in
weight; a dagger, for example.
*	 Medium - Single handed weapons over a kilo in weight; a scimitar, for instance.
*	 Large - Long hafted thrusting weapons such as polearms or spears.
*	 Huge -Two handed slashing, chopping or bashing weapons, like great axes.
*	 Enormous - Weapons used by very large creatures: tree trunks used by giants, for example.

Reach categories use the following guidelines.

*	   Touch - Human reach in unarmed combat, knuckledusters and so on.
*	   Short - Weapons less than half a metre long; such as a short sword.
*	   Medium - Single handed swung weapons longer than half a metre, like a ball and chain.
*	   Long - Single handed thrusting weapons, or two handed swung weapons, e.g. a great sword.
*	   Very Long - Two handed thrusting weapons, spears or polearms for example.

The unarmed attacks of animals and monsters are assigned categories to determine their reach
and how difficult they are to parry.

         Combat Mechanics
Fighting in Legend is a brutal recreation of close combat. Most battles are resolved in a blow by
blow progression, each attack representing a single swing of a weapon. Even if an Adventurer
manages to roll a successful strike at an opponent, the foe is allowed their own roll to see if they
can parry the blow. The same mechanism is used whether the attacks are missile weapons against
opponents diving for cover, a ferocious wrestling match, or trying to evade a charge of angry
dinosaurs.


Attacks and Parries
To make either an Attack or Parry both the attacker and the defender must spend a Combat
Action and roll against their appropriate Combat Style. The attacker’s and defender’s results are
noted because the difference between them, if a difference in level of success exists, is crucial to
the outcome of the exchange.

The intention to parry must be declared before any attack roll is made. However, if the attack
misses then the parrying participant can opt not to complete the parry, thereby saving his CA
from being spent. This does mean, though, that he will not gain a defensive Combat Manoeuvre
(see Combat Manoeuvres, page 134), for the exchange.

Successful Roll
If the attacker succeeds with the attack, he rolls weapon damage and adds his Damage Modifier
(if any).

If the defender succeeds in his Skill Test, then he can reduce the attacker’s damage, if any,
according to the comparative size of their weapons.

*	   Parrying an attack with a weapon or shield of equal or greater size deflects all damage.
*	   Parrying with a weapon or shield of one size less only deflects half damage.
*	   Parrying with a weapon or shield two or more sizes less fails to deflect any damage.

For example, parrying a great axe with a greatsword would block all damage; parrying it with a
target shield would halve the damage and parrying it with a dagger would stop no damage at all.

If the attacker has missed then obviously no damage will be inflicted. However, the defender
should still roll to see if his parry succeeds, in case he manages to beat the attacker’s level of
success - granting them the choice of one or more opportunistic Combat Manoeuvres.

Unsuccessful Roll and Fumbles
If both combatants fail, then the attack/parry sequence ends and combat continues on to the
participant with the next highest initiative. No opportunistic Combat Manoeuvres may be selected.

If either combatant rolls a fumble, then they must also make a roll on the fumble table appropriate
to their weapon or combat type. Fumbling during a combat can have disastrous results and
always results in a roll on the appropriate Fumble table.

There are three Fumble tables; one for Close Combat fumbles (including parries and evading),
one for Natural Weapons and one for Ranged Weapons. When a Fumble occurs, roll on the
appropriate Fumble table for the action involved.



                                                                                                    129

No Combat Actions Remaining/Taking No Action
In a situation where a defender has no Combat Actions remaining or taking no action, or elects
not to parry, he is treated as having automatically rolled a Failure.


Success Levels and Combat Manoeuvres
After both sides have rolled for attack and defence, compare the success levels of the attack and
parry Skill Tests. Differences in levels of success are calculated by how many steps lie between the
two. In other words, if both combatants roll a critical, then the difference between them is 0.

The Levels of Success table summarises the differences in success levels depending on the attacker
and defender’s rolls.

Gaining a level of success over an opponent allows the combatant to perform an opportunistic
Combat Manoeuvre. Combat Manoeuvres can be used to put down an opponent quickly, or
render them helpless in some other way. These are fun to use, encourage tactical thinking and
encourage the adoption of less lethal combat resolution.

Levels of Success
                         Attacker’s Roll
                         Critical            Success              Failure             Fumble
Defender’s Critical         —                   Defender gets 1      Defender gets 2     Defender gets 3
Roll       Success          Attacker gets 1     —                    Defender gets 1     Defender gets 2
        Failure          Attacker gets 2     Attacker gets 1      —                   —
        Fumble           Attacker gets 3     Attacker gets 2      —                   —

For example, an attacker rolling a critical success against the defender’s success gives the attacker a level
of success and therefore 1 Combat Manoeuvre.

A defender rolls a success against an attacker’s fumble giving the defender two levels of success and
therefore 2 Combat Manoeuvres.




                                                                                                             131

       For each level of success over their opponent, the winner selects a Combat Manoeuvre from
either the Offensive or Defensive list, depending on whether the winner was attacking or
defending. So, for example, if the defender beats the attacker by two levels of success, then he
chooses two manoeuvres.

Some of the choices are common to both attack and defence - Damage Weapon, for example
- whilst others are specific to either attack or defence. Some manoeuvres are also specific to a
particular type or weapon; and, some manoeuvres are only available if the winner of the outcome
has rolled a critical success.

The Combat Manoeuvre chosen must be selected before any damage and/or Hit Location is
rolled.

Some manoeuvres can be stacked. For instance, a successful attacker with two levels of success
could choose Maximise Damage twice rather than choosing two separate offensive manoeuvres.

This manoeuvre is stackable.


Offensive Combat Manoeuvres
Bash opponent - Attacks can be used to deliberately bash the opponent off balance. The
recipient is forced backwards by one metre for every five points (or fraction thereof ) of damage
rolled. Bashing works only on creatures up to twice the attacker’s SIZ. The calculation uses the
damage value originally rolled by the attacker, before any subtractions due to armour, parries and
so forth. If the bash forces the opponent into an obstacle then the recipient must make a Difficult
(-20%) Athletics Skill Test to avoid falling prone.

Bleed (Cutting Weapons) - Causes a wound that begins to bleed critically, if the attack
overcomes Armour Points and injures the target. The defender must make an opposed roll of
Resilience vs. the attacker’s original attack roll. If the defender fails, then a major artery or vein
132

         is cut and the wound inflicts a level of Fatigue at the start of each new Combat Round. Bleeding
wounds can be stopped by the successful use of the First Aid skill but the recipient can no longer
participate in any strenuous or violent action without opening the wound up again. Fatigue
levels gained by blood loss remain until sufficient time has passed for the body to recover.

Bypass armour (Critical Success Only) - The blow finds a gap in the defender’s protection.
This counts against worn armour or the natural skin/fur/shell of creatures. If striking a target
that has both natural protection and wearing armour, then the attacker must decide which one is
bypassed. Physical protection gained from magic is considered as being worn armour.

Bypass parry - The defender’s parrying weapon is treated as being one size level less. For example,
Alaric uses Bypass Parry against a troll champion he is fighting. The troll is parrying with a glaive
(size Large). This means that, for the purposes of parrying, the troll’s glaive is treated as size Medium
for countering Alaric’s attack.

Change range - Allows the Adventurer to freely change the engagement range between himself
and the opponent. This can be used to select a more favourable distance for a particular weapon,
or even to disengage from the fight completely if desired (see Weapon Reach).

Choose location - The attacker may freely select the location where the blow lands, as long as
that location is normally within reach.

Damage weapon (Attack and Defence) - The opponent’s weapon is damaged. The winner
rolls the damage for his weapon and applies it to his opponent’s. The opponent’s weapon uses its
own Armour Points for resisting the damage. If reduced to zero Hit Points the weapon breaks.

Disarm opponent (Attack and Defence) - The opponent must roll an opposed test of his
Combat Skill vs. the original attack roll (if the attacker won) or the original parry roll (if the
defender won). If the recipient of the disarm fails, he loses his weapon. Two handed or entangling
weapon wielders may add a bonus of +20% to their skill for this check. Disarming works only
on creatures of up to twice the attacker’s STR. If the attacker has a hand free, he can grab the
opponent’s weapon on a successful Disarm.

Entangle (Entangling Weapons Only) - Weapons such as whips or nets immobilise the
location struck. If an arm, the target cannot use whatever he is holding; if a leg the target cannot
manoeuvre; if the head, chest or abdomen the target suffers a -20% penalty to all activity. On
his next action the wielder may spend a Combat Action to make an automatic Trip Opponent
attempt. An entangled opponent can attempt to break free by either pulling the entangling
weapon away from the wielder with Disarm Opponent, escaping with Slip Free, or cut himself
free using Damage weapon.

Grip (Unarmed) - As for Pin Weapon but requires that the limb used is not holding anything.
Being gripped prevents an opponent from disengaging by use of the Evade skill. Breaking free
requires the spending of a CA and winning an Opposed Test of the Unarmed skill.

Impale (Thrusting Weapons Only) - Weapons such as spears or daggers may impale. Impaling
weapons may roll damage twice with the attacker choosing which damage result to use for the
attack. If armour is penetrated and damage results, then the attacker has the option of leaving
the weapon in the wound, or to yank it free. Leaving the weapon in the wound inflicts a skill
penalty; -10% per size category of the weapon (for example, -10% for small weapons such as
arrows or daggers, -20% for medium weapons and so on). Successfully withdrawing an impaled
weapon during melee costs a Combat Action and requires a successful Brawn roll. This causes

                                                                                                         133

       further injury to the same location equal to the normal damage roll for that weapon but without
any Damage Modifier. Armour does not reduce withdrawal damage. Whilst it remains impaled,
the attacker cannot use his impaling weapon for parrying.

Maximise damage (Critical Success Only) - One of the weapon’s dice automatically does
maximum damage. For example a warsword, which normally does 1D8 damage, would instead
be treated as an 8 whereas a greatsword with 2D8 damage would inflict 1D8+8 damage. This
does not affect the Damage Modifier of the attacker, which must be rolled separately.

Stun Location (Bludgeon Weapons, Attacker Only) - Weapons such as maces, hammers and
so on, can temporarily numb the location struck. The defender must roll an opposed test of
his Resilience vs. the original attack roll. If the defender fails, then a limb is rendered useless, a
torso blow causes the foe to stagger winded (may only defend), or a head shot renders the foe
unconscious. The duration of incapacitation is equal, in Combat Actions, to the damage that
penetrated the armour. If no damage penetrated, then the impact was insufficient to stun.

Sunder (Two-handed Weapons, Attacker Only) - Damages armour worn by the opponent.
Apply the weapon damage (after reductions for parrying or magic) against the AP value of the
armour. Any surplus damage in excess of the AP is then used to reduce the AP value of that
armour location. If any damage remains after the armour has been reduced to zero AP, it carries
over onto the Hit Points of the location struck. This effect may also be used on the natural
armour of creatures, as the blow opens up a horrific gash in their hide, smashes chitin and so
forth.

Trip opponent (Attack and Defence) - The opponent must roll an Opposed Test of Evade vs.
the original attack roll (if the attacker won) or the original parry roll (if the defender won). If
the opponent fails, he falls prone. Quadruped opponents may substitute their Athletics skill for
Evade and gain a +20% bonus to their skill for this test.

Defensive Combat Manoeuvres
Blind Opponent (Critical Success Only) - The defender somehow blinds his opponent. It
could be kicked sand or dust, thrown clothes, sunlight glancing off the shield, or some other
manoeuvre that manages to blur the attacker’s vision. The Attacker makes an Opposed Test of
his Evade skill (or Weapon style if using a shield) against the Defender’s original Parry roll. If the
attacker fails he cannot attack for 1D3 CA.

Enhance parry - The size of the parrying weapon is treated as one step larger for the sake of
blocking damage.

Overextend opponent - Opponent cannot attack on his next Strike Rank.

Pin Weapon (Critical Success Only) - Prevents the opponent from using the pinned weapon or
shield, until he spends a CA to wrestle or manoeuvre the weapon free. This requires an Opposed
Test of combat skills, the winner of which can free their weapon, or continue the pin as desired.
If the Adventurer with the pinned weapon desires, he may substitute Brawn for his Combat
Skill. Whilst pinned, the item may not be used for attack or defence and the foe can only avoid
an attack by using a weapon in his other hand, disengaging completely (using the Evade skill) or
by switching Combat Style.

Redirect blow - The Defender redirects the attack so that it strikes him in a different location,
as long as that location is within reach of the Attacker. The Defender cannot avoid the damage;
he merely chooses where it will land.
134

         Regain Footing - A prone or similarly disadvantaged Defender uses the momentum of the
attack to roll back up to their feet, or grasps the Attacker’s extended limb or weapon to pull
himself upright.

Riposte - The Defender uses a CA to make an immediate counter attack with one of his
defending weapons or shield.

Take Weapon (Unarmed Only) - As for ‘Disarm Opponent’ but only when using Unarmed
skill. If successful, the Defender ends up with the Attacker’s weapon in his own hands.

Slip Free - An Entangled, Gripped or Pinned character may break the hold on himself or his
weapon.

Stand Fast - Skilful or braced footwork allows the defender to avoid the Knockback effects of
any damage received.



Combat Manoeuvres - Optional Rule
Each time that a specific tactic is repeated during a fight, the opponent gains an additional 10%
bonus to his next roll in the combat against the repetitive combatant - be that an opposed roll to
resist the manoeuvre, or their next attack or parry roll. This reflects the advantage gained by the
opponent recognising and taking advantage of the increasingly predictable strategy. The bonus
is cumulative and does not reset until the fight (against that particular opponent) ends, even if
other tactics are interspersed during the combat.



Close Combat Situations
Various modifiers may be applied when using a weapon, or as the result of a Combat Manoeuvre,
as shown on the Situational Modifiers table. These modifiers are applied to attacking, parrying
and evading equally. The skill modifier applies directly to the skill in question and multiple
modifiers stack.

The following tactics and circumstances also affect Close Combat. Each has its own guidelines
to reflect the action being undertaken.

                                                                                                   135

       Cover
If a target is in cover or partially covered by an object (such as a wall, door or fence), any attack
that hits a covered location will instead hit the object. See Inanimate Objects on page 91. Cover
affects both Ranged and Close Combat attacks.

The normal way of negating cover is to use the Choose Location Combat Manoeuvre to aim
at the visible parts of the target - or to strike through the cover if the weapon is capable of
penetrating it.

If the cover is total but the attacker knows his attack will penetrate the cover, he cannot use
Choose Location to target a specific location and must rely on randomly determining a location
(using 1D20) as per normal. In addition, the attacker suffers a -40% penalty to his attack. Note
that this only applies where the Attacker:

*	   Is 100% certain that the target is behind the cover.
*	   The cover is not so extensive as to permit the target to move freely behind it.

Thus, a target lurking behind a bush can still be attacked, even though the attacker might not be
able to see his quarry. However a target behind a lengthy hedgerow is completely obscured and
the attack will automatically fail.


Evading
Some attacks such as missile fire, destructive spells, charging creatures or even dragon’s breath,
can be very difficult to avoid. In these circumstances all an Adventurer can do is hurl himself to
the ground, or dive behind cover to escape the effects.

Evasion attempts are always treated as Opposed Tests, pitting the relevant attack skill against the
Evade skill of the Defender. If the Attacker wins then inflict damage as normal. If the Defender
wins damage is completely avoided. Whatever the result, the evasive gambit momentarily places
the Defender at a disadvantage as he regains his balance, preventing him from performing an
attack with the CA available on their next Strike Rank.

If the winner of the Opposed Test achieves one or more levels of success over his opponent, the
result of the roll may be modified by applicable Combat Manoeuvres as per normal combat.

Some circumstances prevent a character from evading:

*	   The Adventurer is helpless or prone.
*	   There is nowhere to evade to (balancing on a rope above a lake of lava, for example).
*	   A mounted Adventurer may evade only by rolling out of the saddle, automatically
dismounting.

If an Adventurer is facing a close combat attack against which he has no applicable defence -
either because his weapon has been broken, dropped or because the attacking weapon is simply
too big to successfully parry - then he may choose to defend himself by using Evade. However,
using Evade as a melee defence involves giving ground or leaping aside, placing the Defender at
a disadvantage.




136

         Knockback
Any attack which causes more damage than the SIZ of the recipient automatically results in
a knockback. The recipient must immediately make an Athletics test to avoid falling prone
from the force of the blow. He is also shoved one metre for each five points of damage (or
fraction thereof ) exceeding the target’s SIZ. This calculation uses the original damage roll before
subtractions due to parrying and armour.
 
Note that Knockback is different than the Bash Combat Manoeuvre. A Bash is a deliberate tactic
based on timing and technique, whereas a Knockback is the accidental side effect of awesomely
powerful blows. The former is not directly affected by SIZ, whereas the latter is.


Leaping Attacks
Some creatures leap upon their targets in order to knock them prone. A leaping attack requires
a Combat Action to initiate, using an Opposed Test of the creature’s Athletics skill against the
Defender’s Evade skill. The Defender may also Parry with a shield if he has one ready. If the
leaper wins the test then the Defender is knocked prone and cannot recover his feet for the next
1D3 Combat Actions. Otherwise he suffers no other damage. If the Defender is a quadruped,
then it may substitute Athletics for Evade and gain a +20% bonus to roll to avoid falling over.

A leaping attack only affects targets less than twice the SIZ of the Attacker.


Mounted Combat
Whilst mounted, the combat skills of a warrior cannot exceed the value of the Ride skill.
However, the warrior gains the following benefits:
 
*	 A mounted warrior rolls a 1D10+10 for Hit Location if using a small or medium weapon. 
*	 Using a CA the rider may substitute either his own Combat Style or Ride skill instead
 of his mount’s, to defend the mount against attacks. 
*	 The warrior may add the SIZ of his mount to his own for the purposes of avoiding
 Knockback, as long as he can make a successful unopposed Ride Skill Test. 
*	 He can use the Damage Modifier of his mount instead of his own when charging with a
 braced weapon. A weapon braced for a charging attack cannot be used for defence until
 the charge has been completed. Weapons which impale during a charge remain in the
 body of their target and will be lost if the mount continues past (See Charging).


Multiple Opponents
No penalties are suffered if facing multiple opponents. The inherent disadvantage occurs simply
in the fact that the combatant will become swamped by his enemies and run out of Combat
Actions for parrying before his attackers run out of attacks. An attack against an opponent who
cannot parry treats the Defender, by default, as having automatically failed their roll.

If outnumbered in an environment where movement is still possible (not pinned against a wall or
forced into a corner, for example), a Defender may expend a Combat Acton to outmanoeuvre his foes
for the remainder of that round. The attackers participate in a single (group) Opposed roll matching
their Evade skill against the Evade skill of the Defender. Those who fail to beat the Defender cannot
attack that round, as they become blocked by the position of their allies. Those opponents who
win against the Defender may freely attack as per normal. Unless the Defender wishes to disengage
entirely and run away, the number of opponents cannot be reduced to less than one.
 


                                                                                                     137

       An example of how this works in practice would be a swashbuckler using the tables, chairs, stairs and
chandeliers in a tavern to block his multiple foes, whilst he whittles them away one-by-one.
 
Multiple Opponents - Optional Rule
Constant manoeuvring in combat is extremely exhausting. At the end of each round it occurs,
the Defender must make an Opposed roll of Athletics versus the best Athletics skill of the
attackers. If failed, the Defender gains a new level of fatigue. Eventually even the greatest fighters
can be worn down.


Pulled Blows
Sometimes an Adventurer wants to hurt or incapacitate, but not maim or kill, his opponent.
By using Pulled Blows, which also includes using the flat of a blade, as well as limiting the
force applied, the Adventurer can deliberately halve the damage inflicted for a successful hit.
The Adventurer must declare that he is pulling a blow before making the attack; otherwise the
damage is applied as per a normal attack.


Surprise
Surprise is gained when one side in a combat manages to launch an attack without the other side
being aware of the intention and is thus unprepared for it. A carefully staged ambush is the most
common situation for surprise to occur but there will be other circumstances.

A surprised Adventurer is one who:

*	   Has completely failed to notice an impending attack through a Perception roll.
*	   Is attacked when completely unprepared (asleep, perhaps, or absorbed with another activity).
In these circumstances modifiers to combat rolls reflecting the surprised Adventurer’s status
(a -20% penalty for a freshly awoken and groggy character, for example) may apply.

The effects of surprise are as follows:

*	   The surprised party suffers an immediate -10 to his Initiative for this round of combat. For
the following round Initiative is determined as normal.
*	   The surprised party is only able to use CA to defend against attacks (not make them),
including Evading, for this round, and can only use CA in response to attacks made after
his own Strike Rank.


Unarmed Combat
Adventurers or creatures who can reach an opponent with their natural weapons may use their
Unarmed skill interchangeably with any other weapon style they may be using. Punches, kicks,
head-butts and all other Unarmed attacks do 1D3 points of damage.

Users who succeed in an opposed unarmed attack may either: inflict damage, establish a grapple,
or break free. Grappling can only occur if the appendage being used is empty and capable of
gripping. The effects of a grapple depend on the location held. Grappling a limb prevents that
limb being used to attack, defend or move. Grappling the head or torso inflicts a -20% penalty
to all activity attempted by the victim. Combatants with a poor unarmed combat skill may
instead substitute their Brawn skill to maintain or break free of grapples.




138

         Once the grapple is established it continues automatically until the grappler lets go or the
opponent breaks free. Whilst the hold is maintained, on his Strike Rank the grappler may
make unarmed attacks to inflict damage on the location held, by gauging, twisting, crushing or
strangulating the location. The Defender may oppose with his Unarmed or Brawn skill in order
to reduce or block the damage.


Unusual Combat Conditions
Whilst climbing an Adventurer’s Combat Skill cannot exceed the value of his Athletics skill.
Bipedal Adventurers may only use a single limb to attack or defend, requiring the others to cling
to the surface they are scaling.
 
Whilst swimming an Adventurer’s Combat Skill cannot exceed the value of his Swimming skill.
Only thrusting weapons capable of impaling can be used successfully when immersed in water
and those will only inflict half damage. All other weapons are impotent. Natural attacks which
involve ramming, biting or strangulation are unaffected.


Weapon Reach - Closing and Disengaging
Weapon Reach, Closing and Disengaging are optional rules for those desiring more realistic
combat. Roughly speaking, a weapon has a reach equivalent to its size. In circumstances where
the size of combatants’ weapons are different in length by two or more steps, then the wielder
with the shorter reach cannot directly attack the opponent with the longer reach. They are, quite
simply, out of range.

The threat of longer reach is one of the advantages granted by two handed weapons, offsetting
some of the benefits lost by not using a shield. The only method of overcoming this situation is
if the wielder with the shorter reach closes on their opponent.

Although a combatant may be out of range, unable to hit their opponent, they can reverse the
situation by the use of Combat Manoeuvres… such as endeavouring to disarm or damage the
opponent’s weapon; or by changing the engagement distance.

In the case of huge monsters using unarmed combat, the appendage being used to strike with can
be targeted directly and in this case there are no hindrances to counter attack it.

Closing
An Adventurer whose reach is two sizes less than their opponent, needs to actively close into
Close Combat range, otherwise remain unable to strike at them. Closing on an opponent
requires a Combat Action (if not taking advantage of a Combat Manoeuvre) and requires the
opponent to decide whether he wishes to counter the closing action, or whether to strike at the
closer instead. Either option uses a Combat Action.

If the opponent decides to counter the closing action, then the closer and the opponent make an
Opposed Test using their Evade skills. The winner either closes or maintains distance as desired.

However, if the opponent decides to use the closing action to take an attack instead, then the
opponent resists the Evade Opposed Test with his Combat Skill. Whether or not he is hit, the
closer succeeds in reaching Close Combat distance.




                                                                                                 139

       Once within the reach of the opponent’s weapon, the advantage switches to the wielder of the
shorter weapon. The opponent now cannot parry with his weapon until he reopens the distance.

Disengaging
Adventurers that have been closed upon by opponents with a shorter reach are at a serious
tactical disadvantage. Their only escape is to disengage from combat and in so doing, restore
the original range between them. This works in exactly the same manner as Closing. To
disengage requires a Combat Action (again, if not taking advantage of a Combat Manoeuvre)
and the opponent must decide whether he wants to remain in Close Combat distance, or
whether to take an attack at the disengaging combatant instead. Either option also requires a
Combat Action to use.
 
If the opponent decides to remain in close combat, then the disengaging combatant and the
opponent make an Opposed Test using their Evade skills. The winner of the contest either
retreats or maintains distance as desired. However, if the opponent decides to use the disengaging
action to take a free attack instead, he resists the Evade Opposed Test with his combat skill.
Whether or not the blow lands, the disengagement succeeds and the advantage returns to the
combatant with the longer reach.


Ranged Attacks
Ranged weapons include bows, slings and thrown melee weapons such as spears and daggers.
Just as with close combat, ranged combat participants use the skill or style associated with
their ranged weapon to attempt a successful attack - as long as they are within range of the
target.

Ranged attacks can usually only be parried by shields: Defenders lacking a shield have the option
to dive for cover using Evade (see page 136). What this means is that, unless an opponent can
take evasive action or parry, an aAttacker using a ranged weapon has an immediate advantage
because attacks that are undefended automatically gain the aAttacker an appropriate Combat
Manoeuvre. This is a deliberate design mechanic highlighting the potential lethality of ranged
weapons in the hands of a competent warrior.

Certain specific notes concerning ranged attacks are as follows:


Aiming
By increasing the amount of time spent in aiming a missile weapon, an Adventurer can increase
his chance to hit. For every Combat Action that an Adventurer spends aiming, he gains a bonus
to his Ranged Weapon skill equal to his critical range (10%) in that skill. For example, Alaric
has 3 CA and has Sling 46%. By aiming for two CA he would gain two additional +5% bonuses,
taking his chance to hit to 56%.


Loading Ranged Weapons
When a ranged weapon is readied, it is either in hand (for throwing weapons) or loaded (for
bows and other projectile weapons). While readying most ranged weapons takes only a single
Combat Action, others may take more. The number of Combat Actions it takes to load a ranged
weapon is listed in its statistical entry in the Ranged Weapons table, page 109.

 Attacker condition modifiers are cumulative.


Damage Modifier
If an Adventurer’s Damage Modifier can be applied to the damage of a ranged weapon, this is
stipulated in that weapon’s entry on the Ranged Weapons table in the Equipment chapter.


Firing into a Crowd
When firing a ranged weapon into a crowd, Close Combat or any group where the target is
adjacent to one or more other potential targets, there is always a chance the Attacker will hit
someone other than the target he was aiming at.

When firing into a crowd, the Games Master should determine which locations of the target
have cover from the ranged attack. The ranged attack is then resolved as normal for a target
behind cover (see page 136).

If a covered location is hit by the attack, the firer has hit one of the individuals adjacent to the
target (the Games Master will decide who). The accidental target may try to evade or parry this
attack as normal. If the attack damages the accidental target, roll the Hit Location randomly.
                                                                                                    141

86.204.39.123
         If the accidental target successfully evades a ranged attack, the projectile continues on its original
path and may strike the intended target. The intended target may also attempt to evade or parry
the attack as normal.


Firing on the Move
Ranged weapons can be used from horseback or chariots but the chance of success cannot exceed
the Attacker’s skill with either Ride or Drive, as appropriate. If an Attacker is running then
his attack percentage cannot exceed his Athletics skill. Ranged attacks may not be used if the
attacker himself (rather than a mount) is charging.


Impaling Ranged Attacks
An Adventurer that impales an enemy with a Ranged attack (a thrown spear or fired arrow)
obviously does not have the option of immediately attempting to yank out the projectile.


Range
A target within the weapon’s Range may be attacked without penalty. A target within double the
weapon’s Range may be attacked but the Attacker’s effective Weapon skill is halved (before other
modifiers are applied). Attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s Range automatically fail.


Full-Round Manoeuvres
Some manoeuvres take up almost all of an Adventurer’s effort and attention in combat. An
Adventurer who makes a Full-Round Manoeuvre must dedicate all but one of his Combat
Actions for the round to the manoeuvres (usually moving). Full-round manoeuvres must be
declared when the Adventurer first acts in the round.

Full-round manoeuvres include:
*	 Charging (below): The Adventurer moves a total of 3x his normal Movement and attacks
  along the way. During the round, all the Adventurer’s Combat Actions but one must be
  spent on Move, but in each action he moves up to 2x his normal Movement.
*	 Sprinting (see page 93): The Adventurer moves up to 5x his normal Movement. During
  the round, all the Adventurer’s Combat Actions but one must be spent on Move but in each
  action he moves up to 3x his normal Movement.

For example, Alaric is in the middle of a pitched battle between his clan and another band of barbarians.
He is currently unengaged with any particular foe as the battle swirls around him. In the distance, he
sees Thrace being menaced by a trio of foes. Alaric decides to sprint to his friend’s side. At the start of the
next round, when it is Alaric’s turn to act, he declares that he will spend this round Sprinting. Alaric’s
movement allowance for this round increases to 40m (5x his normal Movement of 8m). For his first
Combat Action, Alaric moves 16m. For his second, he moves 16m. He still has one Combat Action left,
and as he has spent all but one of his Combat Actions on moving and thus fulfilled the requirements for
Sprinting, he can spend this last Combat Action to move 8m and make a sling attack on his foes.


Charging
Charging gains a number of benefits but is subject to a number of additional rules:
 
*	 During the round in which he charges, all of the Adventurer’s Combat Actions but one
 must be spent on Move, but in each action he moves up to 2x his normal Movement.
*	 During a charge a bipedal creature improves its Damage Modifier by one step. Quadruped
 creatures improve their Damage Modifier by two steps. For example, a charging horse with
 a Damage Modifier of +1D6 would improve its Damage Modifier to +1D10.
                                                                                                               143

       *	 The recipient of a charge has the choice of either standing firm to receive the charge, or
attempting to evade the charge.
*	 Standing firm allows the recipient the opportunity to strike at the charging opponent but
he will potentially suffer the brunt of the charge attack, usually resulting in serious damage
and/or knockback. If the opponent is mounted they might also face a potential further
attack from the mount or be trampled by it. Unlike normal initiative, whichever combatant
has the longest reach attacks first (see Weapon Reach). 
*	   Evading the charge permits the recipient to make an Opposed Test of his Evade skill verses
the charging opponent’s attack skill or Combat Style (as required). If the recipient wins he
throws himself completely clear of the charging opponent (and the mount if they are riding
one). If he loses he is instead caught at an inopportune moment and is treated as being
defenceless. Using Evade prevents the recipient from making a counter attack. 
*	   If the recipient possesses a long shafted impaling weapon (such as a two handed spear or
polearm) he may set it against the charge and use the Damage Modifier of the charging
opponent (or its mount if the opponent is riding) instead of his own. 
*	   Any charge made against a static formation of defenders, which does not inflict Knockback
on the target, staggers the charging creature into immobility. The charger can also be
stopped if one of its legs is incapacitated (assuming it does not have six or more legs!). 
*	   A mounted Adventurer has the choice of continuing (if he has enough movement left to get
clear of the enemy’s Weapon Reach) after the Combat Action or stopping. If the charging
Adventurer is on foot, then the defender may choose to let the charger continue; if he does
not, then the charger is now engaged with the Defender and must stop moving.
*	   If the charging creature continues, the charge only allows a single Combat Action for the
Attacker, their mount (if combat capable) and the Defender during that round, because the
speed of the charging creature carries it clear of the engagement zone. The recipient of a
charge may not make a further ‘Free’ Attack if the charger continues past and away, since
charging is different from disengaging.
*	   If the charging creature stops, he is now engaged in Close Combat with his opponent.
 
Treat Flyby Attacks the same as Charging.


Damage and Wound Levels
If an attack strikes successfully, it causes damage according to the damage rating for the weapon
(see the statistical entries for Close Combat and Ranged weapons in the Equipment chapter,
pages 101 and 107). A shortsword, for instance, inflicts 1D6 damage.

The rolled damage for the weapon or attack is modified in the following ways:

*	   Add or subtract the Damage Modifier for the Adventurer making the attack.
*	   Modify the damage from any weapon enhancing (or reducing) magic.
*	   If parried, reduce the damage appropriately.

If a Hit Location is armoured (physically and/or magically), subtract the Armour Points value.


Hit Locations
A successful attack damages a specific Hit Location. To determine which location has been hit,
roll 1D20 and compare the number rolled with the Humanoid Hit Location table.


144

         Humanoid Hit Locations
1D20                                       Hit Location
1-3                                        Right Leg
4-6                                        Left Leg
7-9                                        Abdomen
10-12                                      Chest
13-15                                      Right Arm
16-18                                      Left Arm
19-20                                      Head

Some unusual creatures have slightly different Hit Location tables to reflect their own unique
physiology. Such creatures have their modified Hit Location tables listed with their description.

If the damage inflicted by the attack is above zero, then the Hit Location sustains that
amount of damage, with the damage total being immediately removed from the location’s
Hit Points. Note how many Hit Points the location has remaining and the wound category
that results.

Use the following rules if a location receives a Serious or Major wound. Note that wounds
requiring Resilience checks must test them in an Opposed Test against the value of the original
attack roll. This reflects the ability of highly skilled warriors to make more deadly strikes.
Resilience rolls are not repeated unless the location is wounded again.


Minor Wound (Hit Location has positive Hit Points)
Minor wounds are cuts, scratches, bruises and contusions. They hurt, they may bleed but are not
significant enough to slow down or hamper the victim.


Serious Wound (Hit Location is Zero Hit Points or
Below)
If a location is reduced to zero Hit Points or below, the victim receives a Serious Wound. The
location is permanently scarred and the victim cannot attack (but can still parry or evade) for the
next 1D3 Combat Actions due to being stunned or distracted by the pain of the wound.

An Adventurer suffering a Serious Wound to a limb must immediately make an Opposed Test
of his Resilience versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in the limb being
rendered useless, until the location is restored to positive Hit Points. If a leg, the victim drops
prone. If an arm, he drops whatever he is holding unless the object is strapped on (use common
sense here).

An Adventurer suffering a Serious Wound to the Abdomen, Chest or Head must immediately
make an Opposed Test of his Resilience versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure
results in unconsciousness for a number of minutes equal to the amount of damage sustained
in the attack causing the Serious Wound. First Aid or Healing skills can be used to help an
unconscious victim regain consciousness but he will not be able to rejoin any combat until he
has received further healing to the Seriously Wounded location.


                                                                                                   145

       Major Wound (Hit Location has lost twice its starting
Hit Points)
If a location is reduced to a negative score equal or greater than it’s starting Hit Points, the
Adventurer receives a Major Wound. The location is permanently maimed and the Adventurer
is immediately incapacitated, unable to continue fighting.

A limb is considered to be severed, transfixed, shattered or ripped off by a Major Wound. The
Adventurer drops prone, physically incapacitated and must immediately make an Opposed Test
of Resilience versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in unconsciousness
from the agony. If a severed, punctured or ripped-off location is not treated within a number of
minutes equal to the Adventurer’s CON+POW, the Adventurer dies from blood loss and shock.

The victim of a Major Wound to the Abdomen, Chest or Head drops unconscious, totally
incapacitated and must immediately make an Opposed Test of Resilience versus the successful
attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in an instant and gratuitous death (decapitated, chopped
in half, impaled through the heart, torn apart and so forth). If he survives and the location is not
treated within a number of rounds equal to half the Adventurer’s CON+POW, he still dies from
blood loss and shock.

Since most Major Wounds require some form of surgery or major magic to heal, the sufferer will
be very unlikely to recover from a major wound in time to rejoin combat.

Heroic Last Actions
In special cases where key Adventurers receive a Major Wound, the Games Master might allow
a heroic last action - such as spitting out one last spell, attempting to cut down their slayer,
crawling away to hide, or trying to tourniquet their own wound. They must have working limbs
applicable to the action and burn a Hero Point. They get a single opportunity to attempt their
desire and then immediately collapse into unconsciousness and probable death.


Optional Combat Rules For Non-Player
Characters
One of the most time consuming elements of handling Non-Player Characters (NPCs), such as
monsters, enemies and so on is keeping track of locational Hit Points during a fight, especially
where several NPCs are involved. This can become confusing and often slows-down a game
considerably. Legend offers are several optional ways of dealing with this issue.


General Hit Points
First, reserve locational Hit Points for major villains and enemies. For all other foes, use General
Hit Points instead. General Hit Points are calculated on the average of the CON and SIZ
Characteristics, rather than on their sum. So, a foe with CON 12 and SIZ 16 would have 14 Hit
Points (12+16, divided by 2).

*	 Every NPC has a ‘Critical Wound’ rating equal to half the General Hit Points (rounded up).
Thus, in our example, a foe with 14 HP has a Critical Wound rating of 7.
*	 Weapon damage is removed directly from the Hit Point total. When Hit Points reach
zero, the NPC must make a Resilience test to remain conscious. If the test is successful a
Resilience test must be made every combat round until Hit Points are brought up to 1 or
more. If the NPC loses consciousness, death results within a number of Combat Actions
equal to the Critical Wound value, unless Hit Points are brought up to 1 HP or more.


146

         *	 If General Hit Points are reduced to a negative amount equal to the Critical Wound rating
  or more death is instantaneous. In our example, if the foe sustains 14 or more points of
  damage, he dies automatically.
*	   If the NPC suffers a single wound that exceeds his Critical Wound rating in one blow, the
  Games Master may make a roll on the Critical Wound table to determine what additional
  effects are suffered. The armour value being worn is subtracted from the D20 roll.
*	   If the blow inflicted by the Adventurer is a Critical Hit, add the damage to the 1D20 roll.
*	   In addition to the effects detailed in the Critical Wound table, the target always receives an
  impressive-looking scar as a permanent reminder of the experience.

NPC Critical Wound Table

14                                            Target Stunned and must make a Resilience test to
                                           avoid being knocked unconscious.
15           Arm Disabled                     Target’s arm is disabled (broken or paralysed).
                                           Target is Dazed and anything held by that arm is
                                           dropped.
16           Leg Disabled                     Target’s leg is disabled (broken or paralysed). Target
                                           is Dazed and falls prone.
17           Abdominal Injury                 Target Stunned. Must make a Resilience test to
                                           avoid death and spilling intestines over the floor.
18           Chest Injury                     Target Stunned. Must make a Resilience test to
                                           avoid death and coughing up gouts of blood.
19           Head Injury                      Target Stunned. Must make a Resilience test to
                                           avoid death from a slashed throat, thrust through
                                           eye and so forth.
20           Fatal Injury                     A vital location is struck (heart, throat, brain and so
                                           on) and target dies instantly!

Example: Alaric is battling a broo. The broo has 12 General Hits Points and wears 3 points of
armour. On the first blow Alaric hits and inflicts 7 points of damage (after armour has been taken
into account), which exceeds the broo’s Critical Wound level of 6. The Games Master rolls 1D20 and
scores 13. This is reduced to 10, taking into account the broo’s armour. The broo is dazed (losing its
next Combat Action) and needs to make a Resilience test (which it does) to avoid unconsciousness.

On the next blow Alaric again scores a hit, delivering a further 5 points of damage. The broo is now
reduced to zero Hit Points. Since it has been reduced to zero Hit Points it must make another Resilience
roll or fall unconscious. This time it fails and Alaric spends his next action to give it a coup-de-grace.




                                                                                                          147

       Underlings
Underlings are competent but inconsequential foes usually sent en-masse to harass Adventurers.
A simple way to handle fights involving lots of underlings is to radically adjust Hit Points to lend
the advantage to the Adventurer. Whilst they still have combat abilities and can dispense damage
as easily as anyone else (and indeed, they should certainly try), they are there to be sword-fodder
for the heroes of the story. If you choose the Underlings option:

*	 Underlings have a number of Hit Points equal to their CON divided by 2. Damage is
sustained as normal, with armour protecting but when Hit Points reach zero, the Underling
is dead.
*	   A Critical hit inflicted by an Adventurer always incapacitates an Underling, rendering it
unconscious. No Resilience roll is necessary.
*	   If half the Underlings’ number is incapacitated, the rest flee.

Use this option only when the Adventurers are facing a ravening horde of relatively inconsequential
adversaries which are, to all intents and purposes, completely expendable. Competent NPCs and
major villains should be treated differently.


Alaric’s Tale - The Goblin Fight
This part of Alaric’s Tale continues the description of the battle with the three goblins, picking-
up after Initiative and Combat Actions have been determined. The example uses the full combat
rules and does not use the Optional Combat Rules from page 146.

Our heroes are facing three angry goblins.

Alaric is armed with a short spear (1D8+1damage, Size Medium, Reach Long, 4 AP and 5 HP)
and a heater shield (1D4 damage, Size Large). His combat style is Spear and Shield at 80%. As
Alaric uses a shield he gains an additional CA, bringing his CA total to 4.

Lilina is armed with a long sword (1D8 damage, used one-handed, Size Medium, Reach Long,
6 AP and 12 HP) and a heater (1D4 damage, Size Large). Her combat style is Sword and Shield
at 64%. As she uses a shield she gains a CA, bringing her total to 3.

Thrace is armed with a long spear (1D10+1 damage, , Size Large, Reach Very Long, 4 AP and
10 HP). His Combat Style is Spear 58%. As he uses only one weapon, he gains no additional
CA so his CA total remains at 2.

The goblins are armed with short swords (1D6 damage, Size Medium, Reach Short, 6 AP and 8
HP) and bucklers (1D3 damage, Size Medium). They all have the same combat style of Sword
and Shield at 50% and gain a CA for this style, bringing their CA total to 3.

Having determined the order of Initiative, by Strike Rank, and knowing how many Combat
Actions each participant in the fight has, the first round of combat begins.

The Games Master asks each Adventurer, in Strike Rank order, what they intend to do in this
first round of combat. Lilina says she will attack the closest of the three goblins with her sword,
defending with her shield. Alaric says he will attack the larger of the goblins, attacking with his




148

         spear and defending with his shield. The Games Master states that the three goblins are prepared
for a fight and are closing for the attack. Two goblins have singled-out Alaric, as the largest of the
humans and one is advancing on Lilina. Thrace says he is intending to try to circle around the
group of goblins to try and take the pair attacking Alaric by surprise.

First Combat Round
Lilina acts first on Strike Rank 20 and rolls for her Sword and Shield, scoring 55 - a successful
hit. This costs her one of her 3 CA. The goblin attempts a parry, rolling 12 - a successful parry.
There is no difference in the success levels, so neither gains a Combat Manoeuvre; however,
Lilina can roll damage, scoring 7 with her 1D8 longsword damage. Her sword is Medium Size
and the goblin’s buckler is the same: he counters all Lilina’s damage with his shield and has spent
one of his CA doing so. The action now passes to Alaric on Strike Rank 19.

Alaric faces two of the goblins and singles out the meaner-looking of the two for a lunge with
his spear, rolling 94 - a miss. This costs him one CA. The goblin was attempting to parry with
its buckler and scores 19 - a successful parry. The goblin has one level of success better than
Alaric (a successful defence against a failed attack) and so gains a Combat Manoeuvre chosen
from the Defensive options. The goblin chooses ‘Trip Opponent’. Alaric is caught by surprise
by the goblin’s sudden sidestep and must roll against his Evade skill against the goblin’s original
parry of 19 to avoid losing balance. With a 46 Alaric succeeds and easily wins the Opposed Test,
thankfully remaining upright. The action now passes to the three goblins on Strike Rank 14.

The goblin facing Lilina has two CA remaining to use this round and makes an attack with its
short sword, rolling 39 - a success. Lilina has already said that she is parrying and uses a CA to
do so, rolling 69 - a failure. The goblin has thus achieved one level of success over Lilina and
can both inflict damage and select a Combat Manoeuvre. The manoeuvre must be chosen before
damage is rolled and it opts for Impale. This manoeuvre lets the goblin roll damage twice, taking
the best result: it rolls 5 and a 4, so the goblin retains the first roll. He thrusts his sword into
Lilina’s right arm (a roll of 13 on 1D20). Lilina’s armour on this location is leather, offering only
1 AP of protection. She therefore takes 4 points of damage to her right arm and, as she only has 3
HP in this location, sustains a Serious Wound (her right arm HP are now -1) and cannot attack
for the next 1D3 Combat Actions. However, the Impale result for the goblin allows it to either
leave its sword embedded in her arm or withdraw it, causing further damage, if the goblin can
succeed in a Brawn roll. This costs it another CA, meaning that it has used all three of its CA for
this round but the Brawn roll is a success. The goblin inflicts a further 1D6 damage, with the
lucky result of 1, taking Lilina’s right arm down to -2 HP. Her wound level remains at Serious for
that location and she must make an Opposed Test of her Resilience against the goblin’s successful
attack roll. Her Resilience is 45% and she rolls 53, failing. Her arm is badly injured and drops
her long sword from pain, her arm rendered useless until healed.

The action now passes to the two goblins tackling Alaric. The meanest looking goblin has two
CA remaining, having parried Alaric’s spear lunge and the other has three CA. Alaric has three
CA left this round and will defend against both his foes.

The mean looking goblin slashes with its short sword scoring 53, a miss. Alaric is parrying and
so still rolls. His roll is 59, a success, and gains a defensive manoeuvre. He chooses Pin Weapon,




                                                                                                      149

       slamming his shield onto the goblin’s sword blade and wedging it against the ground. The mean
goblin needs to spend a CA to free its weapon but must wait until his Strike Rank comes round
again. Until freed, the mean goblin cannot attack with its pinned sword.

The second of the two facing Alaric also lashes out with its short sword. Alaric spends his third
CA to parry and fails but fortunately the goblin rolls 00 - a fumble! As neither succeeded in their
rolls, Alaric does not get a defensive manoeuvre - but since the goblin has fumbled, it must roll
on the Close Combat Fumble table. The 1D20 result is 4 - the goblin’s sword slips from its grasp
and lands a metre distant. Although it cannot attack with the sword until it is recovered, it can
still use its buckler to hit him instead, if it wishes.

The Initiative moves now to Strike Rank 11 and Thrace, who is yet to act. Thrace asks the Games
Master if he has seen what is happening with Lilina and can he do anything about it? The Games
Master rules that, as Thrace has not done anything yet and because Lilina is quite close, Thrace
can act against the goblin that has injured her. He thus makes an attack against it.

The goblin has spent all its CA for this round and so cannot parry Thrace’s attack. The Games
Master also rules that Thrace is coming at the goblin from the side and awards Thrace a +20%
bonus for flanking. Thrace now rolls against an adjusted skill of 78% and scores 06 - a critical
success! With the goblin’s automatic failure to defend, Thrace has two levels of success, resulting
in two Combat Manoeuvres. And, with a critical roll, Thrace can select from those manoeuvres
that can only be made on a critical success. Thrace chooses Bypass Armour and Maximise
Damage. The first manoeuvre means that the goblin’s scraps of armour, wherever they might be,
will not protect it. Maximise Damage ensures Thrace’s long spear will inflict its full 11 points of
damage, in addition Thrace also adds his +1D2 Damage Modifier, which he must roll, for a total
of 13 damage. The Hit Location he rolls is 11 - Chest. Thrace drives his spear straight between
the goblin’s ribs: the amount of damage results in a Major Wound which, for the chest, means
the goblin must match its Resilience of 38% against Thrace’s attack score of 06. To survive, the
goblin must roll a critical success on its Resilience and gain a higher roll than 06. As this is plainly
impossible to do with a 38% Resilience, the goblin screams as Thrace plunges the spear into its
heart and dies instantly.

The action has now cycled through each participant in Strike Rank order. The Games Master
quickly notes CA remaining for each combatant:

Lilina - 3 CA but has spent two and cannot attack on her next Strike Rank due to her wounded
arm. She has one CA remaining in this Combat Round.

Alaric - 4 CA and has used three: one attack and two parries.

Goblins - the one who attacked Lilina is dead. The mean-looking one has its sword pinned to
the ground by Alaric’s shield but has one CA remaining. The other goblin who dropped its sword
has two CA remaining.

Thrace - has one CA remaining and has saved Lilina in spectacular fashion.




150

         Alaric can now act with his fourth CA. With one goblin pinned and the second weaponless,
Alaric thrusts his spear at the mean goblin. The goblin can only parry with its buckler and uses
its last CA to defend itself. Alaric rolls 24, a success, and the goblin fails to parry. Alaric receives
one Combat Manoeuvre and chooses Impale. He thrusts his spear into the goblin’s abdomen (9
on 1D20). Of the two rolls for damage - 3 on the first and 8 on the second, he naturally chooses
the 8 result. His Damage Modifier of +1D2 takes the overall damage to 10 points. With only 2
AP protecting its stomach and 5HP in that location, the goblin is reduced to -3 HP: a Serious
Wound. This forces the goblin to immediately make an Opposed Test of its Resilience versus
Alaric’s successful attack roll of 24. The goblin’s Resilience is 38% but it fails with a 69, falling
unconscious from the shock and pain. The mean goblin is out of the fight.

However the goblin that lost its sword bears down on Alaric and prepares to make an Unarmed
Attack. Alaric’s spear is still rammed into the mean goblin’s chest up to its crossbar but since he
has no CA remaining he cannot parry anyway. The goblin’s Unarmed is 33% and its scores 09
- a success. Alaric is treated as automatically failing. The goblin selects Disarm Opponent as his
offensive manoeuvre and Alaric makes an Opposed Test of his weapon skill against the goblin’s
original attack of 09. He rolls 98% and is shocked when his shield is ripped out of his grasp,
incidentally taking 2 HP damage to his shield arm from the goblin’s claws!

Action moves back to Thrace and his final CA for the round. He sees that Alaric has his spear
jammed into a possibly dead goblin whilst being battered by another. He also has enough room
to Charge - but he can’t Charge this round, as Charging is a Full-Round Manoeuvre that has
to be declared at the start of a round. He could just move up and attack the goblin, but Thrace
wants the damage bonus from charging. Instead, he casts a quick Magnitude 2 Bladesharp spell
on his spear. As the spell’s casting time is equal to half its Magnitude, it takes only one Combat
Action to cast, and gives a +10% bonus to hit and a +2 bonus to damage.

Second Combat Round
Usually Initiative is maintained for a fresh round but given that two goblins are down, and Lilina
hurt, the Games Master calls for new Initiative rolls. The outcome is:

Alaric 20
Goblin 18
Thrace 17
Lilina 16

Thus, Alaric acts first.

With a goblin bearing down on him and his spear still stuck, Alaric decides to cast a Dragon
Breath spell that he recently learned instead of attacking with a weapon. This Common Magic
spell only takes 1 CA to cast and so takes effect, if successful, on this CA. Alaric rolls against his
Common Magic of 64% and scores 28 - a success. Alaric’s chest swells and he exudes a burst of
flame at the goblin bearing over him. The goblin unwittingly tries to parry this magical fire with
its buckler, immediately failing and thus grants Alaric a combat manoeuvre: he chooses Choose
Location and directs the burst of fire straight into the goblin’s face. Dragon Breath inflicts 1D10
damage and the result is 3. The goblin is wearing a leather helm which protects for 1 AP, so it
sustains only 2 points of damage. It has 4 HP in the head and is thus reduced to 2 - there is the




                                                                                                        151

       sickly stench of burning skin but the damage is not enough to put the goblin down. Alaric has
also just used two Magic Points for the spell.

Now the goblin can act. Angered by the burst of fire it lashes out with its buckler and lands Alaric
a critical blow on a roll of 02. Lacking any shield Alaric attempts to parry with his Unarmed
Combat Skill but rolls 85 - a failure. The goblin has two levels of success now and chooses
Maximise Damage and Bash Opponent. It inflicts 3 points of damage and hits Alaric in the
abdomen; the force of the blow, with Bash Opponent, means that Alaric is knocked backwards by
a metre; Alaric staggers backwards and as his spear is still lodged in the mean goblin, the Games
Master rules that he has been forced to release his grip on it, unless he wants to spend a CA now
in making a successful Athletics roll to keep hold. Alaric decides to take the consequences and is
sent reeling under the force of the blow. The damage is not enough to seriously hurt him since
he has 6 HP in his abdomen; but he will have a nasty bruise.

It is now Thrace’s turn and he is charging. With a blood curdling scream Thrace runs at the
goblin, spear levelled. The goblin knowing its buckler cannot stop all the damage from a
longspear, uses his last CA in an attempt to dive clear using its Evade of 35%. Thrace rolls 13 - a
successful Long Spear check and the goblin rolls 49, failing to avoid the attack. Thrace slams
into the goblin and gains a Combat Manoeuvre too. He chooses Choose Location, opting for
the head. Because he is charging, Thrace’s Damage Modifier increases by one step from +1D2 to
+1D4: his total damage is 6 points for the spear, 3 points for the Damage Modifier and 2 points
for his Bladesharp spell. The goblin takes 11 points of total damage to its head, its 1AP helmet
reducing it to 10. Already damaged in the head from Alaric’s spell, this is a Major Wound for the
goblin and it must make a Resilience roll, opposed by Thrace’s 13 attack, to remain conscious: it
rolls 55 and expires with the spear rammed into one eye.

All three goblin are either dead or incapacitated. Lilina’s arm is bleeding badly and Alaric is
standing shieldless and weaponless, sore from the punch to the guts but Thrace’s fast thinking
and skill with his spear have saved the day. Thrace grins as he cleans his spear tip on the goblin’s
rags and names his spear ‘Goblin Smiter’ - The Games Master likes the touch and awards Thrace
a Hero Point for his actions. Alaric goes over to the injured Lilina and prepares to heal her
wounded arm…

           magic

Magic is inherent to Legend. Access to it is not restricted by culture or profession and, in many cases,
magic is a commonplace element used by most people to aid their daily lives. In a high-fantasy setting,
for example, most Adventurers begin with some common magic, taught to them along with all the
other mundane skills of their society. In other settings magic may be less common but still apparent:
it remains, however, as fundamental as the physical laws of the planet or plane of existence.


The Pursuit of Magic
Even though the magical types work very differently and are, to a large extent, mutually exclusive,
there is nothing to prevent Adventurers from learning and developing more than one magical
style. An Adventurer may therefore freely learn Common Magic, dedicate himself to a god to gain
Divine Magic and even learn a smattering of Sorcery. Sorcerers will more than likely have a good
understanding of Common Magic but may also pray to their gods to gain a few Divine Spells.

In reality Adventurers who desire great magical power will choose one form to pursue above
the others and many societies or cults consider some magical styles to be taboo - but these are
cultural limitations rather than a limitation of the rules. In reality any Adventurer can pursue any
magical style and develop several style simultaneously, if they so wish.


Types of Magic
The three magical types are:


Common Magic
Spells and cantrips that are ubiquitous to many cultures and societies. Common Magic
manipulates the natural order with varying degrees of subtlety and offers a host of effects
that ease daily life or augment specific endeavours, such as combat and skill use. The range of
Common Magic spells an Adventurer might know may be based on how his culture has shaped
and prepared its own use of magic, with some spells being more common, or accepted, than
others. However the nature and effects of Common Magic are visible to all, understood by most
and recognisable from one culture to another.

Although the name - Common Magic - denotes it as being rather banal, Common Magic
spells can still be very powerful, if used carefully and thoughtfully. Sorcerers, Shaman or Priests
might sneer at Common Magic’s limitations but only the most foolish of them would ignore or
denigrate Common Magic’s utility and capabilities.


Divine Magic
Divine Magic stems from the gods. It reflects their natures, ways, spheres of influence, desires,
needs, successes, failures and mythic standing. Gaining access to Divine Magic requires
a dedication of faith and the willingness to enter into a personal relationship with the deity


                                                                                                        153

       worshipped. In return for this devotion the worshipper channels aspects of the god’s power and
abilities. With greater devotion comes greater levels of power: the more the relationship deepens
the more like the god the worshipper becomes.

Divine Magic is not limited in the same way as Common Magic but it does have certain inherent restrictions
based on the depth of faith and the strength of the relationship between worshippers and worshipped.


Sorcery
Sorcerers find their power by unlocking the fabric of reality and shaping it through their ability
to manipulate the rules of creation - moulding it, bending it or breaking it. Sorcery is not based
on a cultural relationship with magic, or a relationship with a god: it is based on formulae and
intellect and an overt desire to manipulate reality to suit the caster.

At its most fundamental level Sorcery appears to lack power. However through a mastery of
manipulation, massive levels of power are possible - effects that go far beyond what is here and
now and visible. The best sorcerers are rightly feared; but to pursue Sorcery to these levels requires
dedication to its cause and a willingness - or need - to engage in lengthy study and research.

The learning of Sorcery may be taboo amongst some cultures and societies because it breaks the
tradition of establishing a relationship with a god. This does not make Sorcery evil necessarily but it
does reinforce the belief that Sorcery is essentially a self-centred activity - an acquirement of personal
power that obviates the need for, and reliance upon, gods. Sorcery is the key to the universe and
sorcerers are often driven to seek and attain power that places them on a par with the gods.


Magic Points
All living creatures possess a basic affinity with magic, whether or not they ever become trained in
it. It is this raw magical power that is nursed and improved by spellcasters over time. This nascent
magical power fuels spells and other magical or mystical abilities and can also provide protection
against magical attacks. In Legend, an Adventurer’s magical power is measured by Magic Points. All
Adventurers start play with Magic Points equal to their POW Characteristic score. An Adventurer’s
POW score also acts as a maximum limit for the amount of Magic Points an Adventurer can store
at any one time. However there are certain things that affect available Magic Points:

*	   Certain Magic Items or Spells can raise or lower these limits.
*	   POW dedicated to a god or cult cannot be used for Magic Points, reducing the available
number for fuelling Common Magic, Sorcery spells or other mystical abilities.


Using Magic Points
Whenever Magic Points are used to power a spell, the total is temporarily reduced by the amount
used. The Magic Point total cannot fall below zero. Using all one’s Magic Points takes its toll
on the body’s physical reserves; if an Adventurer reaches zero Magic Points he must make a
successful Resilience roll to remain conscious.

If the Resilience roll is successful, he gains a level of Fatigue (see page 88 for more on how Fatigue
works); if he fails it and falls unconscious, he remains that way for a number of minutes equal to
his CON subtracted from 21.


Regaining Magic Points
Adventurers automatically regain Magic Points equal to their POW, less any POW dedicated to
a Pact, every 12 hours. They will regain this amount in six hours if they are fully resting, such as
sleeping, or through the use of the Meditation Advanced skill (see page 62).

154

                                 common magic
Common Magic is the name given to a variety of spells that are routinely encountered throughout
many societies where magic is used on a daily basis. Separate cultures may place a different
emphasis on Common Magic’s importance and have very different spells in regular use; but
Common Magic is just what it says: magic that is common to all and encountering it is not
considered to be out of the ordinary.

Common Magic is taught as part of a culture’s approach to and understanding of magic. Thus,
in settings where magic is prevalent, a certain set of Common Magic spells will be taught to the
community as a part of their cultural learning and development. Religious cults and schools of
sorcery generally offer a certain set of Common Magic spells reflecting their nature.


Casting Common Magic
The casting of any Common Magic spell requires a successful Common Magic roll. This one
skill covers casting of any Common Magic spells known. An Adventurer who knows Bladesharp
and Thunder’s Voice casts both at the same Common Magic value; the two spells do not have
discrete casting skills.

Whenever a Common Magic spell is cast there is always a sight and sound that nearby creatures
can detect, be it a flash of light, a crack of thunder or a shimmering in the air. The exact effects
are up to the Games Master and player to decide for any given spell but will automatically be
detected by any creatures within 10 metres times the Magnitude of the spell. Example effects are
included with each spell description.



Alaric’s Tale
Being part of an barbarian clan living in the enchanted Gloamwood, Alaric experiences magic
every day. As part of his clan education, and interest in the heavenly wars of the Thunderer, Alaric
has learned Bladesharp 2, Thunder’s Voice 1, Heal 2 and Vigor 1. He casts all four spells with his
Common Magic skill of 34% and the number following the spell’s name is the maximum magnitude
at which Alaric can cast the spell.

It is likely that, given time, Alaric will learn more Common Magic - either new spells, or by developing
the Magnitude for existing ones.



Situational Modifiers for Common Magic
Like any skill, Common Magic is subject to circumstances which may inhibit a spell’s chance of
success. The Common Magic skill modifiers are as follows:


156

         Casting Modifiers Situational Modifiers
 Situation                                      Skill Modifier1
 Spellcaster is gagged or silenced              Automatic Failure
 Spellcaster is restrained                      -30%
 Spellcaster is prone                           -20%
 Spellcaster is on unstable ground              -20%
 Partially obscured target                      -20%2
 Heavily obscured target                        -40%2
 Totally obscured target                        Automatic Failure

1
These modifiers are cumulative - a prone spellcaster casting at a partially obscured target
decreases his Common Magic skill by -40%.
2
These modifiers only apply if the spell has a target other than the spellcaster, his immediate
location, his carried possessions or a touched object/individual.


Casting Time
All Common Magic spells take a number of Combat Actions to cast equal to half their Magnitude
(rounded up). Thus a Bladesharp 3 spell would take 2 CA to cast. More powerful spells take
longer to cast as the Adventurer seeks to harness the spell’s inherent power.

No offensive Combat Action may be taken while casting a spell, though the Adventurer may
slowly walk up to half his Movement rate or can act defensively, Parrying or Evading, for instance.

The Adventurer need not have a hand free to cast a Common Magic spell, with the exception of
Touch spells, which must be delivered by touching their target.

A spell’s result takes effect at the end of its last casting Combat Action.

Distractions or significant injuries inflicted on a spellcaster as he casts (such as a Serious Wound)
require unopposed Persistence tests to maintain concentration on the spell. If the spellcaster is
incapacitated from a Major Wound or by some other effect, blinded for instance, then the spell
automatically fails.

Magic Point Cost
A Common Magic spell costs a number of Magic Points equal to its Magnitude. So, casting a
Magnitude 2 spell costs 2 Magic Points.

Dismissing Spells
As a single Combat Action, a caster can dismiss any spell he has cast. Ceasing to focus on a
Concentration spell is immediate and not a Combat Action.


Learning Common Magic Spells
In order to learn a spell, an Adventurer must locate a teacher who already knows it and is willing to
teach it in exchange for money, services or even undertaking a quest to prove themselves worthy. An
Adventurer with connections to a religious cult or sorcerous order will have an easier time finding
teachers for more powerful spells. Beginning Adventurers may already have a selection of Common
Magic spells at the start of their adventuring career, depending on their Cultural Background.


                                                                                                     157

       Every Common Magic spell is graded by its Magnitude, a score that indicates its relative power.
Magnitude 1 spells are the weakest and easiest to learn. Learning a new spell takes one day per
point of Magnitude and costs the equivalent number of Improvement Rolls.

Learning Common Magic Spells
Magnitude                Cost                                      Time to Learn
1                        1 Improvement Roll                        1 day
2                        2 Improvement Rolls                       2 days
3                        3 Improvement Rolls                       3 days
4                        4 Improvement Rolls                       4 days
5                        5 Improvement Rolls                       5 days
6                        6 Improvement Rolls                       6 days
7                        7 Improvement Rolls                       7 days
+1                       +1 Improvement Roll                       +1 day

A spell’s Magnitude also defines the intellect required by the individual to absorb, memorise and
articulate its fabric. The maximum Magnitude of a Common Magic spell any Adventurer can
learn is equal to his INT divided by three (rounding up). Thus Alaric, with INT 16 can learn any
Common Magic spell up to a maximum Magnitude of 6. If Alaric wanted to learn the Dragon
Breath spell, it would cost him two Improvement Rolls and two days of study.

Increasing the Magnitude of a known spell is similar to learning the spell at that Magnitude from
scratch. Thus, if Alaric wanted to increase from Bladesharp 2 to Bladesharp 3 he would need
to find a teacher who knows Bladesharp 3 and spend three days in study of the spell. However,
the number of Improvement Rolls required to learn a higher Magnitude version of a spell, is
equal to the difference in their Magnitudes, i.e. learning Bladesharp 4, when you already know
Bladesharp 2, only costs a further two Improvement Rolls.

Learning a spell at a higher Magnitude means that the Adventurer can still cast the spell at a
lower Magnitude if he so chooses or needs. Thus Alaric could learn Bladesharp 3 but still cast
Bladesharp 1 and Bladesharp 2.


Spell Traits and Descriptions
Every Common Magic spell is defined by a series of traits that tells you what kind of spell it is
and how it is used in the game. A description then follows describing the spell’s precise effects.
The traits used by spells are detailed here.

Area (X): The spell affects all targets within a radius specified in metres.

Concentration: The spell’s effects remain in place as long as the Adventurer concentrates on it.
Concentrating on a spell is functionally identical to casting the spell, requiring the spellcaster to
continue to chant and ignore distractions.

Duration (X): The spell’s effects will stay in place for the number of minutes indicated.

Instant: The spell’s effects take place instantly. The spell itself then disappears.




158

         Magnitude (X): The strength and power of the spell. Also the minimum number of Magic
Points required to cast it. If two identical spells are cast on the same target, only the spell with
the greater Magnitude takes effect - their Magnitudes do not stack.

Progressive: This indicates that the spell can be learnt and cast at greater levels of Magnitude.
The spell can also be cast at a lower Magnitude if the caster desires.

Ranged: Ranged spells may be cast upon targets up to a maximum distance of the Adventurer’s
POW x 5 in metres.

Resist (Evade/Persistence/Resilience): The spell’s effects do not occur automatically. The target
may make an Opposed Test of their Evade, Persistence or Resilience (as specified by the spell)
against the casting roll, in order to avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Evade)
spells require the target to be able to use a Combat Action in order to Evade.

Touch: Touch spells require the Adventurer to actually touch his target for the spell to take effect.
The spellcaster must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire casting.

Trigger: The spell temporarily lies dormant until an event stated in the description takes place.
The spell then takes effect and is expended. If the triggering event does not occur within five
minutes, the spell fades.


Common Magic Spells
Abacus
Instant, Magnitude 1

This spell allows the caster to instantly count the quantity of individual pieces, parts or units
that one collection of something has. The caster must specify what is being counted: sacks of
grain on a barn floor, trollish infantry in an army, arrows in a stockpile and so on. This number
will be exact and unerring but will not account for miscalculations due to poorly defined terms
for counting.


Armoursmith’s Boon
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to his next Craft Skill Test
involving any sort of forged metal and cannot stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.


Babel
Duration 5, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

If this spell is successful, it garbles the language of the affected creature. The target can still
think and, for the most part, act normally but anything it says comes out as gibberish. Thus, a
commanding officer would be unable to give orders to his men and a spellcaster would be unable
to cast spells.




                                                                                                      159

       Bandit’s Cloak
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to his next Stealth Skill Test
involving any sort of hiding or lurking and cannot stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.


Bearing Witness
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to his next Skill Test made
to discover lies, secrets or hidden objects and cannot stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.


Beast Call
Instant, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

The Beast Call serves to attract an animal within range. When the spell is cast, it affects a targeted
creature with a fixed INT of 7 or less. If it fails to resist, the creature will be naturally drawn to the
place where the spell is cast, whereupon the spell effect terminates. Any barrier, immediate threat or
counter control also ends the effects of the spell, leaving the creature to react naturally. For example,
the Beast Call spell might cause a horse to turn and walk towards the spell but a single yank of
its reins by the rider would end the spell’s effect. This spell is a potent aid to hunters and herders.


Bestial Enhancement
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

This spell causes the creature to become more bestial, augmenting its natural weapons and
reflexes. For every point of Magnitude, it increases the target’s chance to hit with natural weapons
by +5% and they deal one point of extra damage. This extra damage is magical and will affect
creatures that can only be hurt by magic. The base natural weapon damage remains non-magical.


Becalm
Instant, Magnitude 1, Touch

This spell gives the target the ability to sleep for exactly 10 hours uninterrupted by bad dreams,
pains, aches or even gentle movement. Unless stirred by a loud noise or abrupt physical contact,
the target will have a full night’s rest. It should be noted that the spell does not put the target to
sleep, merely calms their mind in order to better enjoy their next slumber. This spell is useful to
spellcasters who wish to fully regain their Magic Points.


Befuddle
Duration 5, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

If successful, this spell confuses an opponent to the extent that it may forget who it is or who its
friends are. The affected target may not cast spells and may only take non-offensive actions. The
target may run if it so chooses or Evade and Parry normally in combat, though it may not make
any attacks unless it is attacked first.

Spirits and non-corporeal creatures are not affected by this spell.


160

         Bladesharp
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

This spell can be cast on any weapon capable of cutting and/or thrusting. For every point of
Magnitude, it increases the attack chance with the weapon by +5% and deals one point of extra
damage. This extra damage is magical and affects creatures that can only be hurt by magic. The
weapon’s base damage remains non-magical. A weapon under the effects of Bladesharp cannot
benefit from other damage enhancing spells such as Pierce or Fireblade.


Bludgeon
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

This spell can be cast on any crushing or smashing weapon, such as a warhammer, club or mace.
For every point of Magnitude, it increases the attack chance with the weapon by +5% and deals
one point of extra damage. This extra damage is magical and will affect creatures that can only
be hurt by magic. The weapon’s base damage remains non-magical.


Boon of Lasting Night
Area Special, Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

If successful, the spell turns the area of effect into a sphere of darkness equal to a moonless night.
All non-magical light (including sunlight) passing or present within the boundary is reduced to
the equivalent of a candle. This radius of the area is equal to the Magnitude of the spell.


Cauterise
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to his next First Aid or Healing
Skill Test made to mend open wounds and cannot stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.


Chill
Instant, Magnitude 1, Touch

This spell allows the caster to drastically lower the temperature of any mundane object. With this ability he can
speed up the cooling of metal in a forge, make pub drinks cold for his companions, along with several other
interesting tricks. It is up to the Games Master to decide the exact effects this would have in a given situation.


Clear Path
Duration 5, Magnitude 1

This spell allows the caster to move through even the most tangled, thorny brush as if he were
on an open road.


Co-ordination
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the caster’s DEX score increases by two. This may
have an additional effect on his skills and Attributes, such as Combat Actions and Strike Rank.
The caster cannot increase his DEX in this way to more than twice its original value.

                                                                                                                  161

       Countermagic
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

Countermagic is used to dismiss another spell within range. The targeted spell is nullified if the
Magnitude of the Countermagic equals or exceeds its own. Countermagic can be cast reactively
to neutralise offensive spells, by using the Cast Spell Combat Action.

Exploring an ancient tomb, Lilina encounters her dreaded enemy, Rhazil the Vivisectionist.
On his first Combat Action Rhazil casts a Befuddle spell. Lilina immediately declares that she
is using the Cast Spell Combat Action to defend herself. She casts Countermagic 2, which
fortunately dismisses Rhazil’s spell before it can hit her.


Countermagic Shield
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This spell actively disrupts offensive spells aimed at the caster or his equipment. Countermagic
Shield will attempt to block the effects of any spells cast toward it. It will not have any effect on
spells that are already affecting an Adventurer. The effects of Countermagic Shield depend on the
relative Magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell.

Countermagic Shield Results
Incoming Spell’s Magnitude is. . .                     Effect
1 or more points weaker than Countermagic              Incoming spell eliminated and
Shield’s Magnitude.                                    Countermagic Shield remains.
Equal to the Countermagic Shield’s Magnitude.          Both incoming spell and Countermagic
                                                  Shield are eliminated.
1 or more points stronger than Countermagic            Countermagic Shield eliminated and
Shield’s Magnitude.                                    incoming spell takes effect.


Darkwall
Area Special, Duration 5, Magnitude 2, Ranged

By casting this spell, the Adventurer creates a patch of pitch blackness that fills the target area.
Light sources within this area shed no illumination and normal sight ceases to function. Other
senses such as a bat’s sonar function normally. The radius of the area is equal to the Magnitude
of the spell.


Demoralise
Duration 5, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

The target of this spell will become demoralised, losing all hope of victory and losing faith
in its own abilities. When attacking, the target’s weapon skills are halved (before modifiers)
and it may not cast offensive spells. However, the target continues to defend at its full
skill. If this spell takes effect before combat begins, the target will try to avoid fighting
and will either run or surrender. The effects of this spell are automatically cancelled by the
Fanaticism spell and vice versa.

162

       Detect X
Concentration, Magnitude 1, Ranged, Resist (Special)

Detect is several spells, which allow the caster to locate the targets of the spell within its range.
This effect is stopped by dense or thick materials such as metal, or earth and stone at least
one metre thick. It is also blocked by Countermagic Shield (or equivalent spells) of a greater
Magnitude. The separate Detect spells are listed here.

Detect Enemy: Gives the location of creatures who intend to harm the caster. Targets attempting
to keep their motivations hidden may resist with Persistence.

Detect Magic: Gives the location of enchanted items, magical creatures or active spells.

Detect Species: Each unique Detect Species spell will give the location of members of the specified
species. Examples of this spell include Detect Duck, Detect Rhino or Detect Trollkin.

Detect Substance: Each unique Detect Substance spell will give the location of substances of the
specified type. Examples of this spell include Detect Coal, Detect Gold or Detect Wood.

The Games Master should provide the rough power of the detected subject (‘weak magic’ or ‘rich
gold lode’) and require further Common Magic tests for more detailed information.


Disruption
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

A particularly grisly offensive spell, Disruption literally pulls a target’s body apart. For each point
of Magnitude the target suffers 1D3 points of damage to a random Hit Location, ignoring any
Armour Points.


Dragon’s Breath
Instant, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Evade)

With this spell, the caster spits a stream of fire at his target. If the fire is not evaded, it inflicts
1D10 points of heat damage to a random location. Armour Points are effective against this
damage and it counts as both magical and fire damage.


Dullblade
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

This spell can be cast on any weapon but will not affect unarmed attacks or natural weaponry.
For every point of Magnitude, it reduces the damage dealt by the targeted weapon by two.


Endurance
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

For every point of Magnitude, this spell restores one level of Fatigue that the target is currently
suffering from.



164

         Entertainer’s Smile
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to the target’s next Dance,
Sing or Play Instrument Skill Test involving the observations and appreciation of others and
cannot stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.


Extinguish
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

This spell instantly puts out fires. At Magnitude 1, it can extinguish a Flame, Magnitude 2 a
Small Fire, Magnitude 3 a Large Fire and Magnitude 4 will put out an Inferno (see page 83 for
sizes of fire).


Fanaticism
Duration 5, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

The target of this spell becomes fanatical, believing he can defeat any foe and overcome any
obstacle. His attacks with Close Combat Weapon skills are increased by half but he may not
attempt to evade, parry or cast spells. The effects of this spell are automatically cancelled by the
Demoralise spell and vice versa. Willing targets of Fanaticism may surrender to the spell without
resisting it.


Fate
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch, Resist (Persistence)

This spell allows the caster to influence fate, either for the good or ill of the target. The caster can
increase or decrease the target’s next Skill Test by 10% for each point of the spell’s Magnitude.
The caster must choose at the time of the casting whether to increase or decrease the target’s
chances - allowing him to give his friends an advantage or hobble his enemies. Only the next
Skill Test made after (resisting) the spell’s casting is affected.


Firearrow
Instant 1, Magnitude 1, Touch, Trigger

Casting this spell on a missile weapon (such as an arrow, bolt, rock or dart) will cause it to burst
into flame when it is fired or thrown. When it hits a target, the missile will deal an extra 1D6
points of magical fire atop its normal damage. A missile under the effects of Firearrow cannot
benefit from Multimissile or Speedart.


Fireblade
Duration 5, Magnitude 3, Touch

By touching a cutting or impaling weapon, the caster causes its blade to burst into flame. For the
duration of the spell, this weapon will deal an extra 1D6 points of magical fire damage atop of
its normal damage. A weapon under the effects of Fireblade cannot benefit from other damage
enhancing spells such as Bladesharp or Pierce.


                                                                                                        165

       Frostbite
Instant, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

This attack spell allows the caster to freeze his opponent, dealing 1d3 points of damage (rolled
once) to all Hit Locations, ignoring any Armour Points. Magical effects that protect against cold
damage can block this effect but mundane items (such as cold weather gear) are ineffective.


Glamour
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the caster’s CHA score increases by +2. This may have
an additional effect on his skills. The caster cannot increase his CHA in this way to more than
twice its original value.


Golden Tongue
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

The caster gains a bonus to any Commerce, Evaluate or Influence test equal to +5% x the
Magnitude of the spell. This bonus only applies when an Adventurer is evaluating, buying or
selling goods or equipment.


Hand of Death
Instant, Magnitude 4, Resist (Resilience), Touch, Trigger

This fearsome spell allows the caster to deal an awful wound with the merest touch. Casting the
Hand of Death, charges his body with the spell. Touching an unsuspecting target, or succeeding
at an Unarmed attack against a wary target, releases the spell’s effect. If the Resilience test to
resist the effect is failed, the Hit Location touched immediately suffers enough damage to cause
a Major Wound. If the Resilience test is a success, the target only loses 1d3 Hit Points. Armour
does not protect against this damage.


Heal
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the caster can repair one Hit Point of damage to an
injured Hit Location. Casting this spell on creatures of a different species will have half the Hit
Points restored.

This spell cannot re-attach a severed limb, or heal a maimed one. Such wounds require stronger
magic.


Ignite
Instant, Magnitude 1, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

Ignite sets fire to anything flammable within range, creating a Flame (see page 88). Living
creatures cannot be ignited and if the target is worn or held by a living being (such as clothing)
then the wearer/wielder may resist.


166

         Light
Area Special, Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Ranged

When cast on an inanimate object, this spell produces a steady radiance which extends one metre
per point of Magnitude. The area is considered to be illuminated. Note that only the specified
area is illuminated - everything outside the area of effect is not.


Lucky
Instant, Magnitude 2, Trigger

This spell allows the caster to re-roll his next failed Skill Test but cannot be used to re-roll a
fumble. Whatever the result of the second roll may be, the caster must accept it. A caster can only
benefit from one casting of Lucky at a time.


Mason’s Boon
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to his next Craft Skill Test
involving any form of natural earth, stone or sand and cannot stack with any other spell-effect
bonuses.


Mindspeech
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

This spell affects one target for every point of Magnitude. It allows telepathy between the caster
and any target, though targets will not have telepathy with one another. The words transmitted
by telepathy must be whispered and will be heard directly in the head of the recipient, in the
same language in which it was spoken.


Mobility
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the target’s Movement score is increased by one metre.


Multimissile
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch, Trigger

Cast on a missile weapon (such as a knife, arrow, javelin or rock), this spell is triggered when
it is fired or thrown. Multimissile creates one additional magical missile for every point of
Magnitude. Each magical missile’s attack is rolled for separately and compared against the target’s
single Evade or (shield) Parry roll. They use the same dice of damage as the original but will not
benefit from the firer’s Damage Modifier. The additional missiles created through Multimissile
will affect creatures that can only be hurt by magic. A missile under the effects of Multimissile
cannot benefit from Firearrow, Pierce or Speedart.




                                                                                                   167

       Parry
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

Parry improves the caster’s defences whilst parrying with the targeted weapon or shield. Each
point of Magnitude increases his parry chance by +5% and the Armour Points of the weapon
by 1.


Pierce
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

This spell can be cast on any weapon with a blade or point. For every point of Magnitude, it
ignores two Armour Points when it strikes an armoured location, including magical Armour
Points. A weapon under the effects of Pierce cannot benefit from other damage enhancing spells
such as Bladesharp or Fireblade.


Protection
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, one Armour Point is added to every Hit Location of
the caster. This stacks with any existing armour and is treated in the same manner.


Push/Pull
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

This spell allows the caster to move an item of up to 1 SIZ or ENC per point of Magnitude either
towards or away from the caster in a straight line, as if pushed suddenly from one direction or the
other. The item is not moved with significant enough force to inflict damage unless it is naturally
damaging (a bottle of acid, for instance) and the caster has no control over the distance pushed
or pulled; as this depends on the location of the item or the surface it rests on. Living creatures
targeted by this spell are allowed a Resilience roll to resist.


Repair
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

Every point of Magnitude of this spell repairs one Hit Point of damage to a non-living target. The
marks of repair remain visible, probably reducing the target’s market value, unless an appropriate
Craft test is made at the time of casting.


Second Sight
Duration 5, Magnitude 3, Ranged

Second Sight allows the caster to gauge the POW aura of every creature and magic item within
range, which is not blocked from his vision. The caster will know if each aura is less than his own
POW, within three points of his own POW or greater than his own POW.

Second Sight also reveals invisible entities, such as spirits or ethereal undead, though only a hazy
image will show (treat such targets as partially obscured).


168

         Skybolt
Instant, Magnitude 3, Ranged, Resist (Evade)

The caster summons a lightning bolt from the heavens regardless of the weather. The target must
be outdoors in plain view. Skybolt inflicts 2D6 points of damage to a single chosen location.
Only magical Armour Points offer protection against this damage.


Slow
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the target’s Movement score will be decreased by one
metre. A target’s Movement may not be reduced to below one through use of this spell.


Speedart
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch, Trigger

Cast on a missile weapon (such as a knife, arrow, javelin or rock), this spell is triggered when it
is fired or thrown. Attempts to parry or evade the missile suffer a -5% penalty per Magnitude
of the spell and damage is increased by one point per Magnitude. A missile under the effects of
Speedart cannot benefit from Firearrow, Multimissile or Pierce.


Spirit Bane
Area Special, Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Resist (Persistence)

This spell creates a zone with a radius of one metre per point of Magnitude, which spirits find
exceptionally hard to enter. Any spirit with a POW less than the caster’s attempting to enter the
protected area must resist the spell in order to do so. Spirits within the zone at the time of its
creation must resist it or be compelled to leave as quickly as possible.


Strength
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the caster’s STR score increases by +2. This may have
an additional effect on his skills and Attributes, such as Damage Modifier. The caster cannot
increase his STR in this way to more than twice its original value.


Thunder’s Voice
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This spell grants the caster a thunderous voice of command. For every point of Magnitude of this
spell, the caster has +10% added to his Influence skill and can also be heard at up to the spell’s
Magnitude x 100 in metres.




                                                                                                   169

       Understanding
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This spell grants the caster a +5% per point of Magnitude bonus to any Language skill he
currently knows.


Vigour
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the caster’s CON score increases by +2. This may have
an additional effect on his skills and Attributes. The caster cannot increase his CON in this way
to more than twice its original value.


Warmth
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This spell keeps the caster warm and comfortable in a bitter cold environment. He suffers no
penalties to Fatigue tests from a cold environment while this spell is functioning. Warmth also
protects the caster from one point of cold damage (magical or mundane) for every point of
Magnitude.


Water Breath
Duration 5, Magnitude 2,

This spell allows the caster to breathe water for the duration of the effect. Water Breath has no
effect on the target’s ability to breathe air.

         divine magic
Whereas Common Magic is available directly to Adventurers, Divine Magic is not. Divine Magic
is gifted by the gods and is usually available only through membership of a cult - and even then,
only to cult members who have attained an appropriate level of standing within the cult. Lay
members of a cult - those who follow the cult’s precepts and generally adhere to the faith but
make no formal commitment to it - have no access to Divine Magic. Initiates and above - those
who have opted to serve the cult and their god directly - do have access to Divine Magic and
Divine spells are often a significant enough lure to secure this depth of commitment.


How Divine Magic Works
Divine Magic has a number of essential Characteristics separating it from other types of magic:

Spells offered reflect the god. -Unlike other forms of magic, where the Adventurer may seek out
any spells he wishes, Divine Magic is inextricably linked to the god it springs from. No matter
how great her faith, a priestess of the Moon Queen will never be able to hurl a blast of fire, as her
divine patron has no authority over fire.

Divine spells are significantly more powerful than Common Magic spells in that no Magic Points
are needed to cast them; instead they are channelled directly from the god. However, the amount
and strength of Divine Magic any Adventurer can use is dependent on how deep a relationship
that Adventurer has cultivated with his god, through the dedication of POW and increasing the
pact with the deity.

Divine Magic relies on two skills: the Pact skill, which reflects the strength and depth of the
divine relationship and is used to both gain and regain spells; and Lore (Specific Theology) to
cast the spell.


Pact (CHA+Dedicated POW)
Essentially a Pact is a commitment to serve a god through devoting one’s soul through worship.
The making of a Pact is represented by dedicating one or more points of POW to the god. The
Adventurer still possesses the POW for calculating skills but it is the god that harvests the Magic
Points from the dedicated POW.

Making a Pact is simple: the Adventurer, at the point of cult initiation, declares how many points of
POW he intends to dedicate to the Pact. He must dedicate a minimum of one point and a maximum
of one quarter of his available POW. The dedicated POW then forms the basis of his Pact Skill.

An Adventurer may be initiated into more than one cult and thus have several concurrent Pact
skills.



                                                                                                     171

       The Magic Points available to the Adventurer are limited to the amount of his undedicated POW.
Thus, an Adventurer with a POW of 12 dedicating 7 points to his cult would have only 5 Magic
Points available for use elsewhere. Once a point of POW has been dedicated to a cult, it cannot
be used for any other Pacts, until membership of that cult is renounced. Thus, a follower of the
Thunder God with a POW of 10 might dedicate six points to the Thunderer cult but this would
leave only a further four points to be dedicated to another cult. Leaving a cult reduces the related
Pact skill to zero and prevents him from using any Divine Magic from that god - but releases the
POW previously dedicated to that Pact.

Dedicated POW forms the basis of a ‘pool’ of points used to power Divine Magic spells. For
example, a priest with 4 POW dedicated to his god has 4 POW to invest in Divine spells.

The starting value of the Pact skill is equal to CHA + Dedicated POW. Like any other skill it can
be developed through the spending of Improvement rolls, improving the CHA characteristic,
or dedicating further POW. Pact can also be increased in other ways, as the Pact Improvement
table, following, demonstrates. The higher the Pact skill, the more dedicated the follower. It is
not a measure of how much an Adventurer knows about the cult or god; that is still measured by
the Lore (Specific Theology) skill.

Multiple Pacts
Adventurers may join more than one cult, thereby establishing more than one Pact with a deity
- as long as the different cults are compatible (being allied in some way or a sub-cult of a larger
organisation). The only restriction on having multiple cult membership is the amount of POW
the Adventurer is willing or able to devote to each Pact: a Pact always requires a dedication of at
least one POW.

Pact Improvement
Circumstance                                                     Pact Improvement
Undertaking and completing a great quest for your god or         1D10+1
cult. .
Undertaking an unsuccessful great quest.                         1D6
Undertaking a successful lesser quest for your god or cult.      1D4+1
Undertaking an unsuccessful lesser quest for your god or         1D2
cult.
Dedicating more POW to the Pact.                                 1 per point of POW dedicated
Emulating the behaviour of your god in extreme                   1 point per instance
circumstances.

These improvements are in addition to any Improvement rolls an Adventurer wants to use for
developing the relationship with his god.

As the Pact increases, so does the propensity to act in the way or ways the god or focus of
veneration acts. The higher the Pact, the more like the god, or object of veneration, the character
becomes. Thus his character, judgements, deeds and actions reflect those of his god, because the
character is essentially becoming more and more like his god. This kind of behaviour requires
roleplaying for its effectiveness and Games Masters should watch for situations where the
strength of the Pact will assert itself in an Adventurer’s actions. Adventurers can, as their Pact
increases, undergo complete personality changes as a result, although the circumstances where
this happens are judgement calls for the Games Master.



172

         Quests
Gods demand service from their followers, in the form of quests. The nature and scope of the
quest varies from deity to deity. A servant of the Thunderer, for example, might be sent to slay a
terrible frost-worm that dwells atop a distant mountain. Those who worship the Green might be
charged with bringing water to the desert lands, so they bloom with new life. Most quests involve
furthering the god’s aims, protecting other worshippers, gathering new followers, or thwarting
enemies. Not every quest involves travel or adventure; the god of knowledge might demand that
a petitioner solve an ancient riddle or obtain a copy of a lost book of secret wisdom.

Many cults have rituals or myth-cycles that must be enacted again and again as lesser quests. For
example, to advance in the cult of the Thunderer, Alaric must enter the underground pits in the
Vale of Storms and fight his way past the snake-men who dwell there until he finds the Great
Green Gong and sounds it. Completing this lesser quest increases his Pact score by 1D4+1%.
Every aspiring follower of the Thunderer in Alaric’s tribe undertakes this quest.

By contrast, every great quest is unique and extremely perilous. Great quests do not re-enact tired
old ancient myths - they forge brave new legends!

Limits to Dedicated POW
The amount of POW that can be dedicated to any particular Pact is dependent on the rank
and the cult itself. Some cults will have a minimum dedication but all cults have a maximum
dedication, based on the rank. The Cults section of this chapter provides more detail on the
different ranks.

Lay Member (Level 0) - No Dedicated POW
Initiate (Level 1) - ¼ of POW
Acolyte (Level 2) - ½ of POW
Priest (Level 3) - ¾ of POW
High Priest (Level 4) - All POW


Lore (Specific Theology) (INT x2)
A specific theology skill is associated with every god. Thus Lore (The Thunderer) exists discretely
from Lore (Moon Goddess). The skill is used in two ways: first as a measure of the knowledge the
Adventurer has of the god’s myths, aspects, behaviour and so forth and of the rituals, ceremonies
and practices associated with the god’s cult. Secondly Lore (Specific Theology) is used as the skill
roll for casting any Divine Spells associated with the god successfully. So, an Adventurer with
Lore (The Thunderer) 60% has a 60% chance to cast any of the Divine Spells he has gained from
his worship of the Thunder God.

If a deity is part of a wider pantheon then the Adventurer understands the Lore of gods associated
with the pantheon at half his Lore (Specific Theology) value but he cannot use this to cast Divine
Spells. Pantheistic cults do, frequently, teach the spells from one member god to cult members
of an allied cult and where this is permissible then the Adventurer uses his full Lore (Specific
Theology) for spell casting.


Casting Divine Magic
Divine Magic spells are prayed for by the worshipper before they can be called upon. Each
Divine spell takes up a single point of Dedicated POW to store. However, Divine Spells do not
cost any Magic Points when cast, as the caster is channelling the power of their god and is not
fuelling the spell through his own, personal, magical reserves.

                                                                                                    173

       Alaric’s Tale
Alaric has become an Initiate of the Thunderer, a cult strongly represented in his own community.

In becoming an Initiate Alaric has dedicated 4 POW to the Pact, giving him a Pact (The Thunderer)
14%. His POW, for the purposes of available Magic Points, is lowered from 14 to 10 but it also means
that Alaric has four points that can be dedicated towards the Thunder God’s Divine Magic.

Alaric also has Lore (The Thunderer) 52%. The skill means that any Divine Magic spells Alaric gains
as an initiate of the cult are cast at 52%. It also means that Alaric knows the lore of the associated
cult, the Runefather, at 26% because the Thunderer and the Runefather are father and son in the
same pantheon. However Alaric cannot cast any Runefather Divine spells unless they are taught to
him as part of allied cult rituals. If he gains any allied cult spells then they will operate at 52%, his
Lore (The Thunderer percentage.

So at this point in his life Alaric’s understanding of the Thunderer is reasonably strong as he has spent
most of his life exposed to its rituals and practices. However his direct relationship with the Thunderer,
represented by his Pact, is still very weak. Alaric has only just embarked on the road of devotion to his
god and will need to strengthen and deepen his Pact over time.




As a measure of the faith of the worshipper, when a Divine spell is cast it possesses an inherent
Magnitude of one tenth of the caster’s Pact skill. Priests and High Priests are able to channel so
much of their god’s power that their spells are exceptionally hard to block or dismiss.

The same Divine Spell can be learned multiple times.

To cast the spell the Adventurer must successfully roll against his Lore (Specific Theology). Note
the result of the roll.

Critical Success: The spell is cast and may be cast again. It is not placed beyond use.

Success: The spell is cast successfully and is then placed beyond use until the Adventurer can
regain it as per his rank in the cult (see the Regaining Divine Spells).

Failure: The spell does not work but the Adventurer can attempt to cast it again later.

Fumble: The spell does not work and is also placed beyond use until the Adventurer can regain
it as per his rank in the cult (see the Regaining Divine Spells).

When a spell is placed beyond use it is not forgotten; it is merely the case that the Adventurer
cannot channel his god’s power via that spell again, until he has successfully regained the god’s
ongoing trust in their relationship.

Regaining Divine Spells
Depending on their rank within the cult, a spell can be regained upon a successful Pact test,
showing that the Adventurer has re-established their faith with the god and is able to channel
that god’s power once more through the Divine spell. 


174

         Alaric’s Tale
As a Thunderer initiate, Alaric learns Lightning Strike, Blessing (Spear and Shield), Shield and
Channel Strength. This takes all of his 4 points of Dedicated POW to store. The spells are cast at
Alaric’s Lore (the Thunderer) of 52%. His Pact (the Thunderer) of 14% governs the Magnitude of all
the Divine Spells he can cast: at a tenth of his Pact, rounded up, each of his four Divine Spells can be
cast at Magnitude 2 (14/10 = 1.4, rounded to 2).

During an adventure Alaric successfully casts Shield. As the spell was a standard success he cannot use
it again until he has returned to a shrine of the Thunderer and succeeded in a Pact roll of 16% or less.

Later in the same adventure Alaric critically succeeds in casting Channel Strength. This means he can
use Channel Strength again without having to attempt a Pact roll to re-establish his relationship with
the Thunderer. He is forced to cast Channel Strength once more but this time fumbles in the attempt;
not only does the spell fail to work but this level of failure places the spell beyond Alaric’s use until he
can return to a shrine and attempt a Pact roll to recover it.



Lay Members - No access to Divine spells.
Initiates - May test to regain a Divine spell the day after it was used but must return to a shrine
or temple to pray for the spell. It requires a successful Pact test to recover; failure requires that
they try again the following day.
Acolytes - May test to regain a Divine spell the day after it was used; however, if the test fails
they must return to a shrine or temple and recover the spell there.
   *	 Priests - Lords -May test to regain a Divine spell an hour after it was used; however, if
       the test fails they must return to a shrine or temple and recover the spell there.
High Priests - May test to regain Divine spells an hour after they have been used; failing the
roll simply incurs a delay of another hour before they can try again, whereas a fumble means the
spell must be recovered at a temple. 

Dismissing Divine Magic Spells
Like Common Magic, a caster can dismiss any Divine Magic spell(s) he has cast as a single
Combat Action. Ceasing to maintain a Concentration spell is immediate and not a Combat
Action.

An Adventurer may also willingly release a Divine Magic spell from their Dedicated POW.
This immediately frees the spell from their psyche, harmlessly dissipating the divine link and
liberating the point of Dedicated POW to store a different spell if desired.


Acquiring Divine Magic
Learning Divine Magic requires a sacrifice of time and effort. To acquire a new Divine Magic
spell, the Adventurer must possess the Lore (Specific Theology) skill appropriate to the religion
from which the spell is requested and be of sufficient rank within the cult.




                                                                                                            175

       Learning a new Divine Magic Spell
Minimum Cult Rank           Minimum Temple
of Spell                    Requirement            Cost                         Prayer Time
Initiate                    Shrine                 1 Improvement Roll           1 day
Acolyte                     Minor Temple           2 Improvement Rolls          2 days
Priest or High Priest      Major Temple           3 Improvement Rolls          3 days

The Minimum Cult Rank denotes the rank the Adventurer must be within the cult to be granted
access to that spell. The most powerful Divine Magic is withheld for those who have proven their
faith and prowess.

The Minimum Temple Requirement represents the fact that the character must be at a sufficiently
holy site in order for the god in question to grant the spell to the Adventurer. Such temples
will also have experienced Acolytes or Priests that can aid the Adventurer in their religious
supplications. Once learned, the Adventurer must return to a temple of similar status in order
to regain the spell.

The Cost of the spell is how many Improvement Rolls it takes to learn a new Divine spell. Once
taught, there is no further cost to regain the spell by prayer.

Depending on the setting, cults rarely charge a monetary cost for learning Divine Magic,
although they sometimes set tests for worshippers to prove themselves worthy of being granted
such spells. This is for the simple reason that anyone learning Divine Magic from a cult is already
an active member and it benefits the cult to make active members more powerful.


Divine Magic Spell Traits and Descriptions
Every Divine Magic spell is defined by a series of traits describing the spell and how it is used
in the game. A description then follows describing the spell’s precise effects. By default, the
Magnitude of any Divine spell is equal to one tenth of the caster’s Pact. Unless specifically stated
in its description, Divine Spells take one Combat Action to invoke. The other traits used by
Divine Magic spells are detailed here.

Area (X): The spell affects all targets within a radius specified in metres.

Concentration: The spell’s effects remain in place as long as the Adventurer concentrates on it.
Concentrating on a spell is functionally identical to casting the spell, requiring the spellcaster to
continue to gesture with both arms, chant and ignore distractions.

Duration (X): The spell’s effects stay in place for the number of minutes indicated.

Instant: The spell’s effects take place instantly. The spell then disappears.

Ranged: Ranged spells may be cast upon targets up to a maximum distance of the Adventurer’s
POW x 10 in metres.

Rank: The minimum cult rank the spell is available to.




176

         Resist (Evade/Persistence/Resilience): The spell’s effects do not occur automatically. The target
may make an Opposed Evade, Persistence or Resilience test (as specified by the spell) in order to
avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Evade) spells require the target to be able
to use a Combat Action in order to dodge.

Touch: Touch spells require the character to actually touch his target for the spell to take effect.
The spellcaster must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire casting.


Absorption
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell absorbs incoming spells aimed at the target or his equipment, converting their
magical energy into Magic Points which are then available to the target. Once cast on a subject,
Absorption will attempt to absorb the effects of any spells cast at the target. It will not have any
effect on spells that are already affecting an Adventurer. The effects of Absorption depend on the
relative Magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell - see the Absorption Results table for
more details. Any spell absorbed by this spell is cancelled and has no effect.

Absorption Results
Incoming Spell’s Magnitude is. . .           Effect

An Adventurer may not accumulate more Magic Points than his undedicated POW while
Absorption is in effect - excess Magic Points garnered through Absorption simply vanish.
Absorption is incompatible with Reflection, Shield and Spirit Block.


Alter Target
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Ranged

The caster of this spell has the ability to re-direct ranged attacks away from their intended target.
Each missile attack or spell of lesser Magnitude requires a Combat Action to deflect, turning it
away from its original target and towards another victim of the caster’s choice. This new recipient
has to be a viable target for the source of the attack and cannot be the original source of the attack.


Amplify
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

The caster requests that his god boosts the magical abilities of the recipient. While the spell is in
effect all castings of Common Magic with the Progressive trait have their Magnitude boosted by
the Magnitude of this spell. No Common Magic spell can have its Magnitude boosted beyond
10. This increase in Magnitude does not cost the recipient any more Magic Points than normal.

For example, Thrace casts a Magnitude 3 Bladesharp, spending the required 3 Magic Points
and makes the Common Magic Skill Test. Since he is currently under the effects of a Magnitude




                                                                                                       177

       5 Amplify cast by Lilina a few minutes before, the Bladesharp counts as having been cast with
Magnitude 8 for all purposes.


Aphrodisiac
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell increases the target’s sexual attraction. Any failed Influence or Streetwise rolls toward
members of the opposite sex (or those of the same sex that would find the target sexually
attractive), are treated as successes instead. Fumbles, normal successes and criticals are unaffected.
Aphrodisiac makes all opposite-sex individuals around the target friendlier and more focussed
upon them - which could be a very good or very bad thing depending on the circumstances.


Beast Form
Duration 15, Rank Acolyte, Touch

This spell transforms the caster and all his personal belongings into an animal that is sacred to
his cult or faith. The caster retains his INT, CHA and POW scores but exchanges his STR, DEX,
CON and SIZ scores for average values of the animal shape and gains a bonus to each physical
Characteristic of +1 per point of Magnitude. He also gains the natural abilities of the creature.
The animal cannot be mystical or magical in any way and the Games Master should have the
final say as to what manner of creature would fit a specific cult if it is not obvious.


Behold
Duration 15, Rank Initiate

The caster sees what another cult member of equal or lesser rank is currently experiencing.
The image is from the point of view of the cult member being beheld, so there could be some
confusion as to what is happening in certain circumstances (member is sleeping, blindfolded and
so on). This spell does not convey sound, only image and if the member is dead or magically
protected against scrying by a spell of greater Magnitude the caster will be rendered effectively
blind for the duration.


Berserk
Duration 15, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Persistence), Touch

The recipient of this spell is overcome with bloodlust, causing him to disregard his own safety
and loyalties but imbuing him with tremendous stamina and combat ability.

For the spell’s duration the Close Combat skills of the recipient are increased by half again, his
Damage Modifier increased by one step and he automatically succeeds any opposed or unopposed
Resilience or Fatigue test... although a Major wound will still incapacitate him. However, in
return the subject may not Parry, Evade or cast any magic while under the influence of Berserk.

Unwilling targets receive a chance to resist. Normally, the recipient remains in the Berserk
state for the entire duration of the spell but Games Masters may allow a Berserk Adventurer to
shake off the effects with an unopposed Persistence test. At the end of the spell, the recipient
immediately drops two Fatigue levels. Berserk may not be combined with Fanaticism - Berserk
will always take precedence in such cases.


178

         Bless Crops
Duration Special, Rank Priest, Touch

Cast on cultivated farmland Bless Crops affects a number of square kilometres equal to the
Magnitude of the spell. It guarantees a harvest if maintained for a year irrespective of weather or
other conditions. This spell cannot be recovered or released, for as long as the spell is maintained.


Blessing
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell grants a bonus to a cult skill. The target receives a bonus of +5% per Magnitude of
the spell. The specific skill is determined by the caster but must be one of the cult’s skills. For
instance, an Earth Cult might grant a bonus to Craft (Masonry) but a War Cult could grant the
bonus to all Weapon Skills. This bonus cannot be stacked with any other spell-effect bonuses.


Breathe Water
Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Touch

Breath Water allows an air-breathing creature to breathe water (the subject will still be able to
breathe air as well), for up to one hour per point of Magnitude. This spell cannot be recovered
or released, until the spell ends.


Call Winds
Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

Allows the caster to summon or bend the winds to his will, in an area whose diameter is equal to
the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres. The maximum strength of winds the caster can control
or invoke depends on their Cult Rank. Acolytes can summon up to Moderate Winds, Priests
up to Gales and High Priests up to Hurricanes (see Wind Strength page 232). If the caster can
control the wind he may reduce it to Calm or change its direction if desired. This spell cannot
alter magically-created weather effects of greater Magnitude.


Channel Strength
Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Touch

Through this spell the caster can help to prevent the target from suffering from the ill effects of
Fatigue. The target of this spell will not receive another level of Fatigue for up to one hour per
point of Magnitude. This spell cannot be recovered or released, until the spell ends.


Clear Skies
Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

This spell grants a short reprieve from poor weather. The caster creates mild, pleasant weather
conditions in an area with a diameter equal to the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres. Rain
stops, sweltering heat becomes cool breezes and dark clouds separate to reveal the bright and
warming sun. This spell cannot alter magically-created weather effects of greater Magnitude.




                                                                                                     179

       Consecrate
Area Special, Duration Special, Rank Priest

This spell is as much a part of a temple’s foundation as is its cornerstone but may actually be
cast almost anywhere. It creates a sphere with a radius of 10 metres per point of Magnitude. The
consecrated sphere is sacred to the spellcaster’s god. Consecrate by itself does nothing to keep
outsiders at bay but the caster of the spell will know immediately if a spell, spirit or someone who
is not a member of his cult crosses the boundaries of the Consecrate spell.

While within the area of a Consecrate spell, an Initiate of the same religion gains a bonus to Lore
(Specific Theology) tests made to cast Divine Magic spells equal to 5% per point of Magnitude.
Initiates of other gods suffer an equal penalty to such tests.

Consecrate requires one hour per point of Magnitude to cast. This spell cannot be recovered or
released, for as long as the spell is maintained. It is usually the duty of the Priest in charge of a
temple or shrine to maintain the spell.


Crash of Thunder
Area Special, Instant, Ranged, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Resilience)

This spell allows the caster to summon a powerful blast of thunder from the open sky, directed
toward his foes. The spell affects an area around the caster equal to 10 times the Magnitude in
metres, forcing all non-Cult members to resist the spell. Those who fail are knocked from their
feet for 1D2 Combat Actions and struck deaf for 1D6 minutes. Should anyone fumble the
Resistance roll against the spell, they are struck permanently deaf. Also, any items of glass or
pottery will shatter automatically within the area of the spell.


Cure Disease/Poison
Instant, Rank Acolyte, Touch

This spell lifts the effects of any mundane disease or poison afflicting the target; or magical ones
whose potency is less than the Pact % of the caster.

If the disease is the result of a Disease Spirit and therefore magical in nature, the spell exorcises
the Spirit as long its POW is within three times the spell’s Magnitude. For example, a Magnitude
5 Cure Disease/Poison will exorcise any Disease Spirit of POW 15 or less.


Disarm
Instant, Ranged, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Persistence)

This spell gives the caster a powerful ability to take weaponry from the hands of a number of
targets equal to the Magnitude of the spell. When cast, the target makes a Resistance roll for
every weapon or shield in their hands at the time. Each failed roll means that the item is flung or
torn from the target and lands 1D6 metres away in the direction toward the caster. It obviously
has no effect on natural weaponry of any type.




180

         Dismiss Elemental
Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Resilience)

Dismiss Elemental may be cast against Gnomes, Salamanders, Shades, Sylphs or Undines. The
spell affects an elemental of up to one cubic metre in size per point of Magnitude. Failure to
resist the spell causes the elemental to be dismissed and leaves the material substance of its body
in place.


Dismiss Magic
Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate

Dismiss Magic may be cast against either a general target or a specific spell. Dismiss Magic will
eliminate a combined Magnitude of spells equal to its own Magnitude, starting with the most
powerful affecting the target. If it fails to eliminate any spell (because the spell’s Magnitude is too
high), then its effects immediately end and no more spells will be eliminated. A spell cannot be
partially eliminated, so a target under the effects of a spell whose Magnitude is higher than that
of Dismiss Magic will not have any spells currently affecting it eliminated. The caster can also
target Dismiss Magic against a single specific spell.

As long as Dismiss Magic’s Magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell’s Magnitude, the target
spell is eliminated. Dismiss Magic may be fired defensively to neutralise incoming offensive spells,
by using the Cast Spell Combat Action.


Ebb and Flow
Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Ranged

This spell allows a caster to seriously speed up or slow down a water-going vessel of any kind by
forcing the water it rests in to either push faster or work against it. The caster can increase a craft’s
speed by half-again, or decrease it to one-half, chosen at the time of the spell’s casting. The spell
continues until dropped, allowing for higher-powered castings of the spell to make considerable
changes to travel time by boat, ship or raft. This spell cannot be recovered or released, for as long
as the spell is maintained.


Eclipse
Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

This spell turns day into night for a short period of time. Animals flee in confusion, people tend
to question what they are seeing and fear is widespread. Whatever the reason for doing so, the
caster can choose whether it is twilight or midnight black in an area whose diameter is equal to
the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres.



Elemental Summoning
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell summons forth an elemental associated with the god’s portfolio. For example cults
associated with an Earth god would summon Gnomes. The caster summons an elemental of
one cubic metre per point of Magnitude in 1D3 Combat Rounds and remains in the area for
the entire spell duration. For obvious reasons, the caster must have access to the same volume of


                                                                                                         181

       the element’s material to cast this spell successfully. If less volume is available, then the caster can
animate the material with a smaller elemental if desired. The elemental follows the directions of
the caster for the duration of the spell but disperses once the spell expires.


Evergreen
Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Touch

This Spell grants the caster the ability to bless a single plant to become immune to the ravages
of natural weather. A tree will not lose its leaves, flowers will not cease to bud and bloom even
in winter and vines sprawl through the withering heat of high summer. Although this spell alters
the natural state of the enchanted plant, it remains healthy - although some plants may not be
able to seed if enchanted in this manner. This spell cannot be recovered or released, for as long
as the spell is maintained.


Excommunicate
Permanent, Rank Priest, Resist (Persistence), Touch

This spell takes one hour to cast and severs the mystical link a worshipper enjoys with his god,
causing the target of the spell to immediately and permanently lose all Divine Magic from the
caster’s cult. In addition, the target also loses the Pact skill, freeing any POW dedicated to the
god. The target will never again be able to learn or use Divine Magic spells from the cult, though
he will still be able to use Lore (Specific Theology) for purely academic purposes.


Exorcism
Instant, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Persistence), Touch

By means of this spell, a divine spellcaster calls upon their god to drive out a spirit currently
possessing a corporeal being. Whether the possession is dominant or covert is immaterial. The
spellcaster must be open to the spirit world in order to cast this spell - he may not be shielded
by a Spirit Block, or similar effect.

The spirit receives a -5% penalty per point of Magnitude to resist the spell. Failure severs the
possession but leaves the spirit free to engage any other nearby target in Spirit Combat if it
desires. Thus this spell can be potentially dangerous for the caster.


Extension
Duration Special, Rank Acolyte

This spell lengthens the duration of any Divine Magic spell with the Duration trait, for as long
as the caster wishes to maintain it. Extension, and the spell it is extending, is cast simultaneously
by the caster - this is an exception to the normal rule that only one Divine Magic spell may be
cast during a single Combat Action.

If the Extension spell fails to cast while the augmented spell succeeds, the augmented spell is not
extended and operates normally. If the augmented spell fails to cast while the Extension spell
succeeds, the Extension spell is not cast.

Extension prevents recovery or release of both the extended spell and the Extension itself, for as
long as the spell is maintained.

182

         Fear
Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This spell causes the target to be gripped with overwhelming fear. Fear has no effect on
unconscious targets, targets without an INT Characteristic or targets that are currently under
the effect of another emotion controlling spell of higher Magnitude.

Targets that fail to resist flee in terror for a number of minutes equal to the Magnitude of the
spell. Victims will avoid engaging in combat unless forced to.


Fog
Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

The caster creates a thick fog that obscures all vision and muffles hearing, in an area with a
diameter equal to the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres. Anyone caught in the fog has their
Perception skill reduced by half. The fog will remain in the area it was cast but can be pushed
away or dispersed by a significantly strong wind. This spell is useful for stealthily moving large
numbers of animals or troops.


Gleam
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This Spell enchants a single weapon with a speck of bright light that dances along its edge, always
shining through the eyes of the target opposing its attacks. Anyone attempting to Parry or Evade
a weapon currently under the effects of Gleam has their Skill Tests reduced by -5% per point
of Magnitude, due to the dazzling light. Gleam is incompatible with any damage boosting or
weapon skill improving magic, such as Bladesharp, Bludgeon or similar spells.


Heal Body
Instant, Rank Acolyte, Touch

This powerful spell instantly heals a number of Hit Locations equal to its Magnitude. Each Hit
Location thus healed is restored to its maximum Hit Points. The caster may choose which Hit
Locations are healed. Heal Body will even heal maimed, or reattach severed, locations if cast within
an hour of receiving the Major Wound. Beyond this period the Regrow Limb spell is required.


Heal Mind
Instant, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell gives the caster the ability to remove derangements from a single target. In the case
of magically-induced madness or similar instabilities, the spell works on a permanent basis if its
Magnitude is equal to or greater than that of the magical disorder.


Heal Wound
Instant, Rank Initiate, Touch

Heals one location back to its full Hit Points but will not cause a severed limb to reattach or
regenerate.
                                                                                                    183

       Illusion
Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist Special

This spell is used to temporarily modify the sensory projections of a single target, for example a
cow can be made to look like a tiger, sound like a howling wolf when it moos, smell of roses,
taste of butterscotch, feel like it is icy cold, or a combination of these. The caster can adjust one
sensory projection per point of Magnitude. Once set, the illusion can no longer be modified for
the duration of the spell.

Depending on the target, the illusion can extend up to its Magnitude in metres in any dimension.
To cover a larger target, multiple castings of Illusion can be combined together, thus a small
fortress could be made to appear as a briar covered hill for example.

If the spell is cast directly upon an unwilling living target, it may resist with its Resilience.
Observers who interact with the illusion are permitted an opposed Persistence roll against the
spell, in order to resist any debilitating psychosomatic effects it creates, i.e. deafness, pain, nausea
and so on. The illusion itself is incapable of causing harm but the underlying target remains as
dangerous as it was before the spell.


Laughter
Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This spell infects the caster’s foes with laughter, making common activity difficult and exhausting.
The caster picks a number of targets equal to the Magnitude of the spell, who all must resist the
spell individually. Those who fail are subject to gut-wrenching laughter for the duration of the
spell, suffering a - 20% penalty to all DEX-related Skill Tests and a level of Fatigue when the
spell expires.


Lightning Strike
Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Evade)

This spell causes a sizzling bolt of lightning to streak from the hand of the caster toward the
target. If the bolt is not evaded, the spell will cause 3D6 damage to a specified Hit Location.
Natural and worn armour offers no protection against this damage but magical protection does.
However, any magical Armour Points the target possesses are reduced by 1 AP per point of
Magnitude.


Madness
Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This spell causes the target to lose contact with reality and become a gibbering loon. Madness
has no effect on unconscious targets, targets without an INT Characteristic or targets that are
currently under the effect of another sanity influencing spell of greater Magnitude.

Targets that fail to resist, gibber and rave uncontrollably for a number of minutes equal to the
Magnitude of the spell. Victims will perform random Combat Actions during this period. Roll
1D6. 1: Move to Close Combat attack a random target. 2: Run in a random direction. 3: Cast a
spell at random target. 4: Use ranged attack against random target. 5: Shout at random target. 6:
Dance wildly. In non-combat situations, the Games Master should allow the target to perform
passive but perhaps more frightening or entertaining actions.

       Meditate
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This Spell grants a single target the ability to regain their magical strength through mystic
meditation. This requires the target to spend a quarter of an hour in solitude without interruption
but will replenish all of the target’s spent Magic Points after that time. This meditation is not
deep and can be interrupted by any outside contact but the target can make a Persistence Skill
Test to ignore any outside stimuli that might wake him (as long as it is not a direct attack).


Mindblast
Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This spell applies a penalty to the victim’s INT equal to the Magnitude of the spell. This may
cause the target to lose access to some Sorcery spells, or reduce the maximum magnitude of
cast Common Magic. If the target’s INT is reduced below 8 they lose the power of speech and
become animalistic in their thought processes.


Mindlink
Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate

This spell allows the transmission of conscious thoughts, spell knowledge and Magic
Points between participants. Each point of Magnitude in Mindlink allows mind-to-mind
communication between two people, either creating several separate pairs of Mindlinked people,
or making the caster the central hub of a small Mindlink network. In the second case, only the
‘central’ Adventurer is linked directly to other participants. Thus, if Alaric is linked to Lilina and
Thrace, Lilina and Thrace are not linked to each other.

Mindlink must be cast upon all participants at the same time and it is limited to consenting
participants. Those participating in a Mindlink may use the spells and Magic Points of others
they are linked to without consent but only if they have the appropriate skill to cast it, i.e. to
use one of Alaric’s Divine spells, Lilina must possess the Lore (the Thunderer) skill. Divine spells
used in this way must be recovered normally by the original owner.

Participants in a Mindlink have a special vulnerability to INT, POW, CHA and morale-effecting
spells. Such a spell cast against any member of a Mindlink will affect all those connected, though
all participants are entitled to resist individually.

Although participants in a Mindlink share Magic Points and conscious thought, they remain
their own entity. Mindlink does not include hidden thoughts, memories, unconscious urges,
skills or permanent spell knowledge. Any participant may sever their connection to the Mindlink
as a Combat Action, or by leaving the spell’s range.


Rain
Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

This Spell grants the caster the ability to bring rain from a clear sky. For the duration of the spell
rain falls from the sky in an area whose diameter equals the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres.
The rain can be as heavy or light as the caster desires, though not heavy enough to cause severe
flooding but can be the difference between life and death for plants and thirsty men. If Rain is
cast in sub zero temperatures, snow is created instead.


186

         Reflection
Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate

This spell reflects incoming spells aimed at the target or his equipment, redirecting the spell back
at the original caster. It will not have any effect on spells that are already affecting the target. The
effects of Reflection depend on the relative Magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell - see
the Reflection Results table for more details.

Reflection is incompatible with Absorption, Shield and Spirit Block.

Reflection Results
Incoming Spell’s Magnitude is. . .                    Effect
Equal to or weaker than Reflection’s                  Incoming spell reflected and Reflection
Magnitude.                                            remains.
1 or more points stronger than Reflection’s           Reflection eliminated and incoming spell
Magnitude.                                            takes effect.


Regenerate Limb
Concentration Special, Rank Acolyte, Touch

This spell causes a location severed or maimed by a Major Wound to regenerate, or if the
detached location is still present, for it to reattach itself to its stump.

Regenerate Limb takes a number of rounds equal to the location’s HP to reattach or repair,
during which time the caster must maintain concentration on the spell. The Hit Location is
immediately restored to 1 Hit Point at the end of this period. Regenerating a severed location
works the same way but takes minutes instead of rounds.


Resurrect
Concentration Special, Rank Priest, Resist (Persistence), Touch

This spell brings the dead back to life. The body of the deceased must be present and cannot be
lacking any Hit Locations vital for life. If the target died due to disease or poison, the ailment
must be eliminated first or the spell will fail.

Resurrect summons the deceased spirit to approach its former body. The caster of the spell must
then persuade the returning spirit to re-enter its body - while those with unfinished aims or
seeking revenge may be more than willing to return to life, those who died in lingering pain due
to old age or persistent illness may be less than happy at a return to corporeality and may resist
the summoning.

Resurrect takes a number of hours equal to the target’s POW Characteristic to take effect, during
which time the caster must maintain concentration on the spell. A resurrected Adventurer
returns to life with zero Hit Points on all locations.

After death, Resurrect must be cast within a number of days equal to the Magnitude of the spell,
otherwise the magic automatically fails.




                                                                                                        187

       Sever Spirit
Instant, Rank Priest, Resist (Resilience)

This spell severs the bond between body and soul, to devastating effect. The target may resist
the spell by opposing his Resilience with the caster’s Lore (Specific Theology) roll made to cast
the spell. If the resistance attempt fails, then the target dies. If the resistance roll succeeds, then
the target takes one point of damage for every two points of Magnitude of the spell to each Hit
Location simultaneously. This may, in some cases, still result in the death of the spell’s target, if
further Resilience rolls for the damage sustained are failed.


Shield
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell protects the caster from physical and magical attacks. Each point of Magnitude either
gives the caster one Armour Point on all Hit Locations or one point of magical protection,
as per Countermagic Shield, or a combination thereof. These effects are cumulative with
other Common Magic spells, as well as any physical armour the caster is wearing. Shield is
incompatible with Absorption, Reflection and Spirit Block, as well as further castings of Shield
on the same recipient.


Soul Sight
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell allows the recipient to see the POW aura of anyone he looks at, enabling him to
discern that creature’s current Magic Points, as well as the nature of any active spells, the source
of their magic and any enchanted items the creature is carrying. It also allows the recipient to
see into the spirit world.


Spirit Block
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

Spirit Block is one of the most powerful ways in which to block the malign influence of ghosts,
wraiths and other creatures of the spirit world. The recipient of Spirit Block may only be affected
by spirits with a POW greater than the spell’s Magnitude, squared.

Spirit Block Effectiveness
Spirit Block’s Magnitude           Recipient May Only Be Harmed By Spirits With…
1                                  POW 2 or higher
2                                  POW 5 or higher
3                                  POW 10 or higher
4                                  POW 17 or higher
5                                  POW 26 or higher
6                                  POW 37 or higher
7                                  POW 50 or higher
8                                  POW 65 or higher
9                                  POW 82 or higher
10                                 POW 101 or higher

Spirit Block is incompatible with Absorption, Reflection and Shield.


188

         Sunspear
Instant, Ranged, Rank Priest, Resist (Evade)

This spell will only function in direct sunlight. When cast a shaft of light, two metres wide,
streaks from the sky to blast a single target. If the target does not evade, the blazing light will
burn it for 2D6 damage per Hit Location (roll separately for each location). Armour Points are
not effective against this damage and it counts as both magical and fire damage.


Sureshot
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

Sureshot magically guides the trajectory of missiles thrown or fired by the recipient so that they
almost always hit, no matter the situational modifiers or cover, as long as the target is within
range of the weapon.

For the duration of the spell, any failed missile attack roll is treated as a success instead. Fumbles,
normal successes and criticals remain unaffected. The target of the missile attack can still attempt
to Parry or Evade as normal.

Sureshot may not be combined with Firearrow, Multimissile or Speedart - Sureshot will always
take precedence in such cases. Precise Attack attempts do not work whilst this spell is operating.




True (Weapon)
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

Cast on the specified type of Close Combat Weapon, this spell doubles that weapon’s normal
damage dice. Other bonuses, such as Damage Modifiers, are not affected. The wielder of the
weapon should roll the weapon’s damage twice and total the result.




                                                                                                       189

                                                                            sorcery

Sorcery uses formulae, both written and mentally envisaged, to achieve magical effects. A
somewhat crude way of looking at Sorcery is to consider it as short-cuts and bypasses that alter
the fabric of creation to serve the caster’s own ends. Whereas Common Magic is a miscellany of
charms and cantrips, and Divine Magic channels the powers of the gods, Sorcery is a deliberate
attempt to bend the way the universe functions.


Sorcery Grimoires
Sorcerers record their spells in grimoires. A grimoire can hold just one spell or many. Some
grimoires are disparate collections with no single theme whereas others are deliberate collections
of spells of a particular nature, gathered together to reflect a particular mindset or requirement.

Grimoires can take unusual forms. In some cultures they are often recorded on scrolls or within
tomes. However these are perishable, so some civilisations engrave grimoires on plates of metal,
carve them into stone walls or even embed them in crystalline formations. Since the recording of
a spell takes up a large amount of space, most enduring grimoires are near immovable and even
the smallest scroll with a single spell is large and unwieldy.


Sorcery and Other Types of Magic
Because Sorcery is based on deliberate endeavours and has little basis in naturally occurring
magic, many cultures view it with deep suspicion and may shun it completely. Sorcery may be
viewed as heretical and manipulative - magic that breaks the very nature of a divine relationship
or corrupts the stability of the spirit world.

Some sorcerers view Common and Divine Magic with contempt. A good sorcerer does not need
to rely on the relationships these kinds of magic require; all he needs is his own intellect and his
grimoire. Sorcery can remove the tiresome, restrictive constraints necessary to the other kinds of
magic. He can, if he chooses, stand alone and still wield great power. In more open minded societies
where Sorcery forms part of a cult’s structure, it is often at the expense of Divine Magic - either
because those who established the cult possessed no celestial or otherworldly relationships to begin
with, or have lost it through overly dedicating their energies to developing the power Sorcery offers.


How Sorcery Works
A sorcerer works magic through two skills, Sorcery (Grimoire) and Manipulation.


Sorcery (Grimoire) (INT x2)
The Sorcery (Grimoire) skill reflects the knowledge of all the spells learned from within a
particular grimoire. It is this skill which a sorcerer rolls against to see if they cast a spell correctly.
The skill also limits the effect of the spell. A sorcerer can study more than one Grimoire and thus

190

         possess many Sorcery (Grimoire) skills. Sorcerers are not in the habit of carrying their grimoires
around with them: a grimoire is a powerful document and the physical thing is often closely
guarded. Therefore sorcerers are forced to memorise spells from their grimoire(s). The complex
equations, symbols, incantations and arcane gestures consume a great deal of mental capacity.
Therefore no sorcerer can ever memorise more spells, from one or multiple grimoires, than he
has INT, with one spell occupying one point of the INT Characteristic. A sorcerer with INT
16 could thus keep in his mind up to 16 spells from the same or multiple grimoires. Casting a
spell does not erase it from his mind; but to change which spells he has memorised a sorcerer
must spend 1D6 hours expelling an old spell from memory and memorising a new one from its
grimoire.

For Example, Jedekiah is a sorcerer of one of the illustrious Jade Circle Schools. As a member of the
Seventh Circle sect he has Sorcery (Seventh Jade Grimoire) 60% and Sorcery (Book of the Whisperer)
45%. His INT is 14. The Seventh Jade grimoire has over a dozen spells in its pages whilst the
Whisperer’s Bookhas only six. Jedekiah can therefore memorise any combination of spells from either
grimoire as long as the total number of spells does not exceed 14. To successfully cast those spells found
in the Seventh Jade Grimoire he needs to roll 60% or less; and 45% or less to cast those from the
Whisperer’sBook.

If the same spell is found in one or more grimoires a sorcerer knows, he always casts it at the
highest rated Sorcery (Grimoire) percentage.


Manipulation (INT+POW)
On their own, Sorcery spells can be quite weak and limited in their scope. However a sorcerer’s
true power lies in his ability to extend the fundamental aspects of all spells, enhancing their
reach. By default, Sorcery spells cast without any Manipulation have a Magnitude of 1, a Range
of touch, a Duration equal to the caster’s POW in minutes and focus upon a single target.
However, the Manipulation skill allows a sorcerer to modify the spell’s Magnitude, Range,
Duration, Targets and even Combine several spells into a single casting.

Manipulation is a single skill which can be applied to all known Sorcery spells; a separate
Manipulation per Grimoire is not necessary.

The Manipulation skill is never rolled against when casting a spell. Instead, each 10% or fraction
thereof of the Manipulation skill allows one point of Manipulation to be assigned to a single
Sorcery spell component. Sorcerers therefore need to specify at the moment of casting how the
points of their Manipulation skill will be used. For example, Jedekiah with Manipulation 50%
could place three points into manipulating Duration and two into manipulating Range; or five into
a single component.

Manipulation of the following components is possible:

Magnitude: Used to penetrate magical defences or resist magical attacks.
Range: Used to increase the distance a spell can be cast over.
Duration: Used to extend the period of time the spell’s effects last.
Targets: Used to increase the number of targets affected by the spell.
Combine: Used to fuse together several spells into a single casting.

The Sorcery Manipulation Table shows what effect each point of Manipulation has on the
different spell components. It takes no Manipulation to cast a Sorcery spell in its basic format
(as indicated by the ‘None’ row).

                                                                                                          191

Magnitude
Sorcery spells have a default Magnitude of 1 at no additional Magic Point cost. It costs one
Magic Point to augment the Magnitude of a Sorcery spell, regardless of its final intensity.

Manipulating this component allows the sorcerer to increase the Magnitude of a spell. For Sorcery
spells Magnitude is only used to see if it will overcome magical defences or resist magical attacks. It
does not modify the effect of the spell which is controlled by the Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.

Range
Sorcery spells have a default Range of Touch, at no additional Magic Point cost. It costs one
Magic Point to augment the Range of a Sorcery spell, regardless of its final distance.

Manipulating this component allows the sorcerer to increase the Range of a Sorcery spell. Unlike
other manipulations the range value does not progress linearly, enabling sorcerers to cast spells
over great distances. However since most spells require the target to be under direct observation,
a sorcerer often needs other forms of perception or magical aid to cast sorcery reaching beyond
their immediate senses.

Spells cast at a Range of Touch require the sorcerer to make a successful Unarmed attack on
a resisting target. To avoid touch spells a recipient must use Evade to dodge the attack, since
defending with a Combat Skill will still transfer the magical effect through the parrying weapon
or shield.

If Range is augmented beyond Touch then the caster automatically strikes his intended target,
unless the target is able to dive for cover or flee out of reach before the spell is completed.

Duration
Sorcery spells have a default Duration equal to the POW of the caster in minutes, at no additional
Magic Point cost. It costs one Magic Point to augment the Duration of a Sorcery spell, regardless
of its final time span.

Manipulating this component allows the sorcerer to increase the Duration of a Sorcery spell. The
maximum Duration to which the spell can be increased to is noted in the Sorcery Manipulation table.

192

         Targets
Sorcery spells have a default Target of one person or item, at no additional Magic Point cost. It
costs one Magic Point to augment the Targets of a Sorcery spell, regardless of the final number
of recipients.

Manipulating this component allows the sorcerer to increase the number of targets of a Sorcery
spell. The maximum number of targets the spell can affect is noted in the Sorcery Manipulation
table. If the spell is cast successfully, the effect of the spell is applied multiple times, once for each
target included; the spell’s potency is never divided between them.

Combine
Manipulating this component allows the sorcerer to combine the effects of multiple Sorcery
spells in a single casting, so they will affect the target simultaneously. This is the most powerful
aspect of Sorcery, as it allows a skilful sorcerer to use his Magic Points judiciously and achieve
multiple effects within a short space of time.

A spell may not be combined with itself - only different spells may be combined.
If the combined spells come from different grimoires, then the lowest Sorcery (Grimoire) skill is
used as the base casting chance.

The spells must all have the same target or targets. A sorcerer cannot combine a Palsy targeting
an enemy and a Spell Resistance targeting himself, for instance.

Any other Manipulation effects applied in a combined spellcasting apply to each and every one
of the spells involved. Only one Magic Point need be spent per Manipulation effect, regardless
of the number of spells involved.

Each additional spell added to a combined spellcasting costs one extra Magic Point and reduces
the casting chance by 10%.


Casting Sorcery Spells
A sorcerer must be able to gesture with his hands, be able to visualise the lay-out of the spell as it
appears in the grimoire and be able to chant in order to complete the casting. Whenever a spell
is cast, there is always a sight and sound that nearby creatures can detect, be it a flash of light, a
crack of thunder or a shimmering in the air. The exact effects are up to the Games Master and
player to decide but attempting to invoke a spell subtly permits nearby observers an opposed roll
of their Perception versus the casting roll to spot the invocation.

Casting a Sorcery spell requires a successful Skill Test of the Sorcery (Grimoire) skill to which
that spell belongs.

Magic Points
Sorcery spells cost one Magic Point plus as many Magic Points as the number of Manipulation
effects applied to it. Jedekiah, for example, casting a Sorcery spell upon himself with no
Manipulation uses only a single Magic Point. Applying five Manipulations would cost six Magic
Points (one for the basic spell, plus one point per Manipulation). Casting two spells upon himself
at the same time with the same Manipulations applied to both spells would cost seven Magic
Points, as well as reducing his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill by 10%.



                                                                                                          193

       Casting Modifiers
Sorcery spellcasting tests apply the same modifiers as Common Magic spellcasting tests.

Casting Critical Successes
If the Sorcery (Grimoire) roll is a critical success, the spell costs no Magic Points to cast,
irrespective of the amount of Manipulation applied to it.

Casting Failures
If the casting test fails the spell does not take effect and costs the caster a single Magic Point.

Casting Fumbles
If the Sorcery roll is fumbled the spell fails and the sorcerer loses the full Magic Point cost of
the spell.

Casting Time
All Sorcery spells take as many Combat Actions to cast as the number of Manipulations used
to cast them, with a minimum casting time of 1. No other Combat Action may be taken while
casting a spell, although the Adventurer may still walk up to his Movement rate while spellcasting.

A spell’s effect takes effect at the end of its last casting Combat Action.

Physical and magical attacks on a sorcerer as he casts automatically ruin the spell if he suffers
a Major Wound, is immobilised, or is prevented from observing the target. Lesser distractions
require successful Persistence tests to maintain concentration on the spell.


Dismissing Sorcery Spells
Like Common Magic, a caster can dismiss any active Sorcery spell(s) he has cast as a single
Combat Action, at any point.

Acquiring Sorcery
Adventurers desiring to learn Sorcery must fulfil certain conditions:

Have access to the grimoire from which the spell originates.
Be able to read the language of the grimoire.
Have time to conduct the study in quiet and solitude.
Possess enough Improvement Rolls to learn the Sorcery (Grimoire) skill for that grimoire.

No matter how many spells are contained within, it requires one week of studying a grimoire
to gain its specific Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. This is treated as learning a new Advanced Skill
and starts at a base percentage of INT x2. Once the theories and philosophy described by the
grimoire are understood, the sorcerer may then begin to learn the spell or spells contained within.

Each spell takes a further week and two Improvement Rolls to learn, after which the sorcerer will
then be able to cast that spell using the Sorcery (Grimoire) skill for the grimoire it belongs to.
A sorcerer belonging to a sorcery cult is usually forbidden from transcribing the spells from the
grimoire - as doing so may allow the knowledge to spread beyond their reach.




194

         Depending on the setting and culture, admittance to such grimoires may be difficult. Whilst
membership of some sorcery cults or schools may allow study of their grimoire free of charge;
others might require gifts paid, quests performed or attaining a specific membership rank before
granting access.

Spell Traits and Descriptions
Every Sorcery spell is defined by several traits defining the spell and how it is used in the game.
A description then follows describing the spell’s precise effects. The traits used by Sorcery spells
are detailed here.

By default all Sorcery spells are binary in effect rather than progressive: they either work or they
do not. The strength of the effect, or scope of the target they can affect, is dependent on the
caster’s Sorcery skill in the grimoire from which that spell comes.

Autonomous: The spell’s effects will remain until its duration ends, without need for
concentration.

Concentration: The spell’s active effects continue so long as the Adventurer concentrates on
it. Once focus is dropped, the spell’s effect ceases or remains static until concentration can be
resumed. A sorcerer may move or perform non-complex actions without penalty. More stressful
situations, such as walking a narrow ledge, engaging in combat, suffering serious injury, or casting
another spell immediately require a Persistence roll to maintain focus. By default a sorcerer may
only concentrate on a single Concentration spell at any one time.

Resist (Evade/Persistence/Resilience): An offensively cast spell does not take effect
automatically. The target may make an Opposed Test of their Evade, Persistence or Resilience
skill (as specified by the spell) against the casting roll of the sorcerer, to avoid the effect of the
spell entirely. To resist using the Evade skill, the Adventurer must expend a Combat Action.


Abjure (Substance/Process)
Autonomous

There are many Abjure spells; for instance, Abjure Air, Abjure Food, Abjure Water and so on.
Each discrete Abjure spell permits a sorcerer to forgo a single specific substance or process
necessary for life, such as air, water, food, sleep and so forth. The sorcerer can affect a living target
of up to three points of SIZ for every 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, utterly removing the
need for that particular requirement until the spell ends. Thus an Abjure (Air) spell could allow
a sorcerer to move underwater without needing to breath.

Many exotic versions of this spell exist, which affect dreams, pain or even aging.


Animate (Substance)
Concentration, Resist (Special)*

This spell animates a specific type of substance as indicated by the particular spell; thus there are
many variants of Animate available. The sorcerer animates three points of SIZ or a cubic metre of
insubstantial material for every 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, causing it to move about and
interact clumsily with its surroundings. The substance moves at a rate of one metre by default,




                                                                                                         195

       although points of SIZ or ENC may be substituted for extra movement on a three for one basis;
and cubic metres on a one for one basis.

Jedekiah knows the Animate (Wind) spell and has increased his Sorcery (Seventh Jade Grimoire)
to 73%. He is sailing a small skiff across the sea when he sees a warship bearing down on him.
In desperation he tries to escape and invokes the wind to his aid. The Games Master decides
that the skiff ’s sails hold two cubic metres of air, so the remaining six cubic metres Jedekiah
can normally control may be used instead to increase the wind’s speed. Converting them over
and adding to the base one metre speed provided by the spell, allows the skiff to be blown at an
additional seven metres per round. More than enough to outdistance the warship.

The sorcerer’s chance to have the animated object perform any complex physical skill is equal
to his own chance to perform that action halved (before any modifiers). If combined with the
appropriate Form/Set spell (through application of the Combine Manipulation), the caster can
perform much finer manoeuvring of the target. In this case, the animated object will use the
caster’s full skill scores for physical activities.

*The myriad versions of this spell normally only affect inanimate matter, such as clay, steel, dead flesh
and so on; or ethereal substances such as air, fire, darkness. If the substance is already under magical
control or is a living elemental, then the target gains a Resistance roll of some form, such as an opposed
magical skill or Persistence. Darker versions of this spell are rumoured which allow sorcerers to animate
living creatures and control them like puppets.


Attract (Harm)
Autonomous, Resist (Persistence)

This spell steers attacks of a singular type within its range, so they strike the recipient instead. It
works differently according to the type of harm affected by the spell variant. This can even cause
a spell or missile attack to turn back upon its own caster!

Magic - Draws offensive spells of up to 1 Magnitude per 10% known in the Sorcery (Grimoire)
skill.
Missiles - Attracts all missile attacks which inflict up to a maximum (including magical
augments) of 1 Hit Point per 10% known in the Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.
Spirits - Baits any hostile spirit with up to 3 POW per 10% known in the Sorcery (Grimoire)
skill.
Energy - Redirects all sources of harm linked to a particular energy or effect, such as fire, poison,
cold, undeath and similar forces.


Banish
Autonomous, Resist (Persistence)

Allows a sorcerer to dismiss spiritual or demonic entities of up to 3 POW per 10% of his Sorcery
(Grimoire) skill. If the spell overcomes the Persistence of the targeted entity it is sent back to
the Plane from whence it originally came. The spell does not work against otherworldly beings
which are bound within a material object or fetish. However, if the entity is temporarily freed
from its binding to perform a service, then the spell breaks whatever magical hold linking it to
its owner/master. Likewise the spell cannot cast forth a spirit or demon possessing a victim, only
one that is first tricked into abandoning the host.



196

         Castback
Autonomous

Castback is a defensive invocation shielding the sorcerer from hostile magic and has a chance
of sending it back to the attacking spellcaster. It reflects hostile magic of up to 1 Magnitude per
10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill and only affects spells that target the user specifically
and possess the Resist trait. Such spells may affect the protected Adventurer normally but if it is
resisted, the spell is launched back at the person who cast it.


Damage Enhancement
Autonomous

This spell can be cast upon anything capable of inflicting physical damage; weapons, traps,
unarmed attacks or even other offensive spells. Attacks and weapons, where maximum damage
does not exceed two Hit Points per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, will always do
the maximum amount of damage without needing to roll.

Thus a sorcerer with Damage Boosting 43% could cast the spell on a War Sword, which normally
does 1D8 damage. If successful, the sword would then automatically inflict eight points of
damage every hit until the spell ended.


Damage Resistance
Autonomous

This spell protects the body of the recipient (including clothing and small belongings carried
upon his person) by generating an invisible force field, which deflects incoming damage. Any
attack where damage does not exceed one Hit Point per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire)
skill, glances off with no effect - although the protected Adventurer may still suffer from
Knockback if applicable. Attacks that inflict more damage than the spell can handle, completely
bypass it with no reduction.

Damage Resistance may be combined with other spells which provide magical Armour Points.
In this case the damage is compared to the Damage Resistance spell first and only encounters the
Protection spell if the Damage Resistance is bypassed.


Diminish (Characteristic)
Autonomous, Resist (Persistence/Resilience)

A Diminish spell exists for each Characteristic (so, Diminish Strength, Diminish Constitution
and so on). The spell temporarily reduces a target’s Characteristic by two points per 10% of
the sorcerer’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. To be effective, the targeted creature must possess the
Characteristic in question. If used malevolently Diminish (STR, DEX, CON or SIZ) are resisted
with Resilience; Diminish (INT, POW or CHA) are resisted with Persistence. The minimum
value any Characteristic can be reduced to is 1.

Note that creatures affected by Diminish SIZ actually shrink, rather than becoming wasted and
skeletal as they do with the Tap spell. Diminish is incompatible with any other Characteristic
reducing spell.



                                                                                                      197

       Dominate (Species)
Concentration, Resist (Persistence)

This spell gives the caster control over a creature belonging to a specific species: thus many
variations of this spell exist. A sorcerer may attempt to dominate a target of up to 3 INT per
10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. If the target fails to resist, it must obey the commands of
the caster for the duration of the spell. Suicidal commands instantly break the spell, although the
target might be tricked into doing something indirectly fatal. Commands which run contrary
to the target’s ethics or instincts allow the dominated subject another opposed Persistence roll
to escape control.

The controlled target shares a limited one-way telepathic link with the sorcerer by which it can
receive orders. If the sorcerer and the dominated creature do not share a common language, the
sorcerer can order it by forming a mental image of the actions he wishes it to perform. However,
control of the subject lapses once it leaves the normal Range parameters. To keep track of what
a dominated subject is doing once out of sight; the sorcerer must use some other form of magic.

A separate Dominate spell must be learned for different species. However, each variant is quite
broad in scope, covering an entire family of a type of creature. For example: felines, canines,
bears, fish, snakes and so forth.


Enhance (Characteristic)
Autonomous, Resist (Persistence/Resilience)

An Enhance spell exists for each Characteristic (so, Enhance Strength, Enhance Constitution
and so on). Essentially the reverse of the Diminish spell, Enhance temporarily increases the
specified Characteristic by two points per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. A creature
must have the Characteristic in question to be affected and the Characteristic cannot be boosted
beyond twice its original value.

If used malevolently, Enhance (STR, DEX, CON or SIZ) are resisted with Resilience; Enhance
(INT, POW or CHA) are resisted with Persistence.

This spell is incompatible with any other Characteristic boosting spell.


Fly
Concentration, Resist (Evade)

Using this spell allows the caster (or whomever or whatever he targets with the spell) to fly.
A sorcerer can affect a target of up to 3 SIZ per 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. Those
affected by this spell move at the spellcaster’s behest, not their own. By default the spell grants
a Movement rate of one metre per round, although points of SIZ may be substituted for extra
movement on a three for one basis.

Offensive use of the spell allows a victim to attempt an opposed Evade roll (or equivalent) to
initially break free of the spell’s grip.




198


       Form/Set (Substance)
Autonomous, Resist (Resilience)

There are many Form/Set spells in existence, each one controlling a general type of substance.
The categories are broadly based upon form and material, for example; gases, liquids, earth and
stone, metal, wood, flames, darkness, ice, flesh and bone and so on.

The spell affects up to three points of SIZ (or one cubic metre of an ethereal/gaseous substance)
per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. For the duration of the spell, the affected material
can be formed into whatever shape the sorcerer desires; although complex configurations require
an appropriate craft skill and several rounds of concentration to mould. Assuming the material is
solid, the substance retains its shape at the end of the spell. More mutable substances like water
immediately flow back to their natural form.

This spell can also be used to mend damage done to an object. The sorcerer must be able to affect
the entire object and must succeed at an appropriate Craft test; but if successful he will restore
the full Hit Points to an item.

Normally this spell is only employed on inanimate substances. However, if used against a living
or animate creature, the spell must be able to affect the entire target and the target receives an
opposed Resilience roll to resist. No damage is inflicted on those that fail but their appearance
and outward physique may be warped as desired.


Glow
Autonomous, Resist (Evade)

This spell causes an area to glow with a soft light, bright enough to be able to read by. Sorcerers
can illuminate a space of up to one metre radius for every 10% of their Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.

The light is able to counter Darkness spells equal to or less than its Magnitude. However, if the
Darkness spell is centred upon an animate creature, then the target may resist using its Evade skill.


Haste
Autonomous

Haste increases the Movement rate of whatever it is cast on. The spell affects targets of up to 3
SIZ per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. By default, the base Movement of the target
is doubled. To further improve speed a sorcerer may substitute surplus points of SIZ for extra
movement, each 3 SIZ giving an extra one metre. Haste is incompatible with other Movement
boosting spells.


Hinder
Autonomous, Resist (Evade)

Hinder decreases the movement rate of whatever it is cast on. The spell affects targets of up to 3 SIZ
per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. By default, the base Movement of the target is halved.
To further reduce speed a sorcerer may substitute surplus points of SIZ for extra effect, each 3 SIZ
giving an additional reduction of one metre per round. A target’s Movement cannot be lowered to less
than one with this spell. Hinder is incompatible with other Movement slowing spells.


200

         Holdfast
Autonomous, Resist (Resilience)

Holdfast causes an object of up to 3 SIZ per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, to
merge with another, contacting surface. The binding is unbreakable by normal means, save for
the destruction of the target or the surface it is bonded to. Only magic can dispel the effect, by
overcoming the Magnitude of the Holdfast.

This spell can affect both organic and inorganic substances. However, if a sorcerer attempts to
bond a living being, or anything it is holding or wearing, the spell may be resisted using the
Resilience skill. Failing to resist indicates the victim is bound to an object it touches, or his sword
is bound inside its scabbard for example.


Intuition
Concentration, Resist (Persistence)

Intuition allows a sorcerer to discern the emotions and motives of the target, as if he had made
a successful Insight roll. The caster may affect targets of up to 3 POW per 10% of his Sorcery
(Grimoire) skill. The sorcerer however is unable to read memories or guarded thoughts, so a
target who is aware that this spell is being used may attempt to veil his feelings, gaining another
opposed test of their Persistence roll against the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) percentage, each time
the caster attempts to discern a new fact.


Mystic Vision
Concentration

This spell allows the caster to perceive magic, by augmenting his primary senses. It allows him
to see, hear or perhaps even smell spells, enchanted items and even a creature’s Magic Points.
The sorcerer must be able to actually detect the creature or object for this spell to work. Mystic
Vision also enables observation into the hero, spirit and essence planes - although the spell does
not grant access.

Sorcerers will either roughly know how many Magic Points an object or creature currently has
(1-10, 11-20, 21-30 and so forth), or will automatically be aware of a spell’s magical origin
(Common, Divine or Sorcery).

Spells or enchantments of up to one Magic Point (or POW) per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery
(Grimoire) skill, have all their attributes revealed - including what the spell does, whether it has
been overcharged, enchantment conditions and the unique ‘aura’ of who cast it; which can be
used to identify other spells cast by the same person.


Neutralise Magic
Autonomous

Neutralise Magic negates a combined Magnitude of spells on a target. The spell affects up to
one point of Magnitude for every 10% of the sorcerer’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. It works by
dismissing the most powerful spell it can act on, reducing its own effect by the Magnitude of the
eliminated spell, then continues to dismiss the next most powerful spell it can still affect. A spell
cannot be partially eliminated, so only ‘complete’ spells are negated.


                                                                                                       201

       Jedekiah is under the effect of a Magnitude 2 Protection spell, a Magnitude 4 Haste spell and
a Magnitude 6 Damage Resistance spell. When hit by a Neutralise Magic cast at 44% (affects
5 Magnitude), the Damage Resistance spell is ignored as it is too powerful. The Haste spell is
neutralised but this reduces the Neutralise Magic’s effect to 1, which is not enough to take out
the Protection spell.

Enchantments and other permanent magical effects are temporarily neutralised for the duration
of the spell.

Neutralise Magic can be used defensively, as if parrying or evading to neutralise incoming spells.


Palsy
Autonomous, Resist (Resilience)

This spell paralyses one random Hit Location on the target. The sorcerer can affect locations of
up to ome Hit Point per 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. The effect of the spell depends on
the location struck. A limb stops working; the abdomen causes both legs to collapse and the head
or chest results in unconsciousness.


Phantom (Sense)
Concentration, Resist (Special)

Each specific Phantom spell produces an illusion which affects a different sense or perception.
There are five basic versions, one for each of sight, sound, smell, taste and touch; but there are
also variants for unusual sensory mechanisms (such as the darksense of trolls). Illusions produced
by each Phantom spell are stimulations of the target’s own perceptions and nervous system - not
temporary manifestations of reality.

Targets of a phantasm must succeed in an opposed test of their Persistence against the caster’s
Sorcery (Grimoire), otherwise they truly believe what they are experiencing.

Phantasms cannot cause direct harm, although they may be injurious in an indirect manner,
such as creating an illusion of a cow over a griffon, or by masking the taste of a virulent poison.
However, most effects are psychosomatic in nature and permit further Resistance rolls when
used offensively.

Phantom spells can react to their surroundings as long as the sorcerer maintains concentration
over them. If concentration lapses, then the illusion remains static within the victim’s mind,
continuing to produce the last effect imagined by the caster - the smell of roses, a moaning wind,
bone biting cold and so on. The sorcerer can resume concentration at a later time to change the
illusion as long as the spell has not expired. Multiple Phantom spells can be concentrated on
simultaneously as long as they are cast as a single spell using the Combine manipulation.

Spells providing magical protection block a Phantom (Sense) spell of equal or lesser Magnitude.

Odour
This spell reproduces any single scent, anything from the delectable odour of lotus perfume to
the stench of rotting flesh. If used offensively and the caster overcomes the target in an opposed
roll of Sorcery (Grimoire) versus Resilience, an odour can be created which incapacitates or
entrances those who smell it.

202

         Taste
This illusion creates or hides any single taste for consumables, substances or persons within the
spell’s effect. If used offensively, such as creating the burning effect of hot chillies to cause the
victim to gag, the caster must overcome the target in an opposed roll of Sorcery (Grimoire)
versus Resilience. Several Phantom (Taste) spells could, for example, make a meagre meal of
boiled worms, sour berries and nettle leaves taste like the recipient’s favourite meal - although
the texture might need some work.

Sight
Creates a visual illusion of anything the caster can imagine. The vision is completely non-
corporeal, so physical interaction passes straight through. If used subtly, it can augment or
modify the appearance of an already existing target; granting outlandish clothing or changing
colour for example. Creating a complete fabrication out of context with the setting, or physically
interacting with it, allows the viewer an opposed roll of their Perception against the caster’s
Sorcery (Grimoire). Animate creatures produced by this spell, which appear to perform complex
physical actions, use the relevant skills of the sorcerer. For example, an illusionary giant ant sent
to attack the recipient would use the caster’s own Unarmed combat skill to fight.

Sound
This spell creates an audible illusion, anything from a whisper to a clap of thunder. The caster
can manipulate the nature and volume of the sound as long as he continues to concentrate upon
it. Although a sorcerer can create very loud sounds, he cannot cause permanent deafness or
damage with them. However, the illusionary volume can be such that recipients standing next to
each other need a Perception roll to hear each other speak; and any task which requires hearing
one’s own voice or maintaining concentration (such as spell casting), must win an opposed test
of Persistence against the spell to continue.

Touch
This spell creates an illusion of tactility, which can be Combined with other illusions to give
them a greater sense of reality. It can simulate any type of tactual sensation from feathery to
prickly, soft to hard and even hot and cold. Since the spell simply produces an illusionary
sensation in the nerves of those who touch the phantasm, it cannot inflict and is itself, immune
to damage. However, victims of the spell may still believe they have been wounded and must
succeed in opposed rolls of Resilience versus the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) in order to avoid
the (psychosomatic) effects of receiving a Serious or Major Wound, even though they have not
suffered any actual harm.


Protective Ward
Autonomous

This spell requires the use of the Combine manipulation. It must be coupled with Damage
Resistance, Spell Resistance, Spirit Resistance or any combination of these three spells. When
completed, the Protective Ward creates an area of protection of up to one metre radius per 10%
of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. Casting the spell requires that the ward be inscribed into
a solid surface, such as hard packed earth, stone flagstones or even a wooden deck of a ship. Once
cast it cannot be moved, although the surface it is inscribed upon can be.

The Protective Ward’s perimeter contains the benefits of its combined Resistance spell(s). It only
inhibits spells or attacks entering the circle from the outside - attacks or spells originating within
the circle are unaffected. Thus a Protective Circle against spirits would block out external spirits

                                                                                                      203

       but have no effect on those already inside its perimeter. A Protective Circle against damage or
spells would block out incoming attacks/spells but have no effect on those attacks made within
the sphere (including attacks targeting those outside the sphere).

Diverse versions of this spell are known which rely upon different geometries (circles, triangles
and so on) or runes.


Project (Sense)
Concentration

Each ‘Project (Sense)’ is an individual spell, specific to one of the five primary senses but there are
also variants for unusual sensory mechanisms, such as Darksense. The spell allows the sorcerer
to project one of the recipient’s senses beyond his body via an invisible and intangible receptor,
which transmits the specified type of sensory input back. This permits the recipient to use his
Perception skill (with that sense) anywhere the receptor is.

The sorcerer decides at the time the spell is cast where the receptor initially manifests - either beside
the spell’s recipient or a location well known to the sorcerer within the spell’s range. The receptor
has a Movement of one metre per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. Concentration is
only required to move the receptor - when stationary, the spell is treated as Autonomous instead.

A sorcerer can use Project (Sense) to be able to aim a second spell at a target who is out of direct
observation - whether because of distance or blocking obstacles. The piggy-backed spell must
also have sufficient Range to reach the target.

Project (Sense) can be detected by those using magical perception and, if desired, dispelled.
Attacking the receptor with a magically augmented weapon or a spell, will transfer the magical
damage/effect back to the recipient.


Regenerate
Concentration

This spell functions much like the Divine Magic spells of Heal Wound and Regrow Limb, in that
it will repair Serious or Major Wounds, even allowing a severed or maimed limb to be reattached
or grow anew. The sorcerer may rejuvenate locations with a maximum of one Hit Point per 10%
of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. This spell cannot raise an Adventurer from death.

Regenerate heals a damaged location back to one Hit Point (and no more), requiring the sorcerer
to concentrate for a period of one entire round per HP recovered. Locations which have been
severed and cannot be reattached take one minute per HP healed to regenerate.


Restoration
Concentration

One of the few methods known of healing Characteristic damage, such as that caused by
the Tap spell, Restoration works in a similar manner to Regenerate. The sorcerer may restore
Characteristics of up to three points per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. If the
original value of the Characteristic was higher than this, then it cannot be healed. Each point
restored takes one minute to regenerate.


204

         Sense (Object or Substance)
Concentration

Eminently useful for finding valuables, lost possessions or hidden objects from afar, this
spell has a variant for every substance imaginable. Sense (Substance) causes all sources of
that substance within range of the spell to resonate to the caster’s dominant sense. For
example, diamonds may visibly gleam like ice; amber could taste like cinnamon; water
tinkle with a crystalline chime and so on. Whilst the spell can be cast over extreme ranges,
it has difficulty detecting substances concealed or blanketed behind significant layers of
solid material. The spell can penetrate a combined thickness of up to one metre of wood/
earth/rock/water, or one centimetre of metal per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire)
skill. For example, if a sorcerer is seeking a hidden hoard of gold in a castle, his Sorcery
skill’s value must be able to penetrate the combined thicknesses of all the walls between
him and the treasure.

Although each Sense spell is specific to particular objects or substances, the categories can be
quite broad. For instance: gems, flesh and bones, metals, weapons, cult specific artefacts or even
chaos.


Shapechange (Species) to (Species)
Autonomous, Resist (Resilience)

Shapechange morphs the shape and form of a target from one species to another. A sorcerer
can affect, in total, up to three points of SIZ per 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire). The SIZ of
the original form, added to the difference in SIZ between the original and modified form, must
be within this range. The target acquires the average physical (STR, CON, SIZ and DEX)
Characteristics of the creature assumed, plus whatever natural attacks and modes of locomotion
it possesses. If the caster has a superior skill than the new form, he may substitute his own in
preference.

For example, a sorcerer of SIZ 10 who wishes to change into a brown bear (average SIZ 25),
requires a minimum Sorcery (Grimoire) of 81%. Whereas if the same sorcerer wished to turn
into a dog (average SIZ 3), he would only need a Sorcery (Grimoire) skill of 51%.

Each Shapechange variant is a separate spell. However, each species is quite broad in scope,
covering an entire family of a type of creature. For example: felines, canines, bears, fish,
snakes and so on. The spell only works on living things - the dead or inanimate cannot be
shapechanged.


Smother
Autonomous, Resist (Resilience)

A sorcerer may cast Smother on a target of up to 3 SIZ per 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.
If he fails to resist he begins to asphyxiate, immediately suffering damage at the start of the
following Combat Round and continues to suffocate for the duration of the spell.

This spell can also be used to extinguish fires, as the flames will be starved of oxygen. In this case
the sorcerer can affect up to three cubic metres of flames per 10% of Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.




                                                                                                      205


         Spell Resistance
Autonomous

A magical ward that blocks any incoming spell of up to 1 Magnitude per 10% of the caster’s
Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.

Spell Resistance remains in place for the entirety of its duration - spells that successfully breach
the Spell Resistance do not dispel it. However, it does not discriminate between incoming spells
- a comrade attempting to magically heal the recipient of Spell Resistance must overcome it in
order to successfully use a healing spell.


Spirit Resistance
Autonomous

This spell blocks spirits or otherworld entities of up to 3 POW per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery
(Grimoire) skill, from coming into contact with the recipient. A blocked spirit unable to touch a
recipient will not be able to personally attack or harm him, or engage him in spirit combat. Spells
cast at the recipient by a spirit or otherworld entity, are likewise blocked unless their Magnitude
exceeds the Magnitude of the Spirit Resistance.


Tap (Characteristic)
Concentration, Resist (Persistence)

Each Characteristic has a Tap spell; thus Tap (Strength), Tap (Constitution) and so on.
These devastating spells allow the caster to permanently strip a target of Characteristic points,
transforming the tapped Characteristic points into Magic Points for his own use. It works only
on creatures possessing the Characteristic being tapped. It is possible for a sorcerer to Tap his
own Characteristics… but that is truly the act of a desperate sorcerer.

The Characteristics of targeted creatures can be reduced to a minimum of 1. However, Tap only
consumes and transfers one point per round, making it less versatile in combat. Characteristic
points lost to Tap are destroyed permanently, though the victim can regain them via certain
healing magic, or by raising them through the normal means of increasing a Characteristic.

A Characteristic may be tapped for up to one point per 10% of the sorcerer’s Sorcery (Grimoire)
skill, from which the sorcerer gains an equivalent number of Magic Points. The sorcerer can only
increase his Magic Points to double his normal maximum, although he may simply Tap a target
and dissipate any excess - a truly malicious use of the spell. All Magic Points above his normal
maximum gained through Tap disappear once the spell expires.

Note that creatures affected by Tap (SIZ) become wasted and skeletal, rather than shrinking as
they do with the Diminish spell.

There are reputed to be exotic and very rare versions of the Tap spell that consume other aspects
of a victim, such as Tap (Youth), Tap (Emotion), Tap (Memory) and so forth. Without exception,
these are regarded with even more loathing and hatred than the more common Tap spell!




                                                                                                    207

       Treat Wounds
Concentration

This spell dramatically accelerates the natural healing rate of the target. It heals up to one
Hit Point per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, at the end of each round. The
amount healed can be divided across multiple locations as the recipient desires. However,
the healing does not affect Serious or Major Wounds, which require the Regenerate spell
instead.


Telepathy
Autonomous, Resist (Persistence)

The telepathy spell allows a sorcerer to not only mentally communicate with the target but also
receive its sensory perceptions as well. If this is undesired the target may resist the spell. The
caster can establish a link with creatures of up to 3 INT per 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.
The more skilful the sorcerer, the better able he is to penetrate the mental complexities of more
intelligent creatures. If sub-sentient such as in the case of an animal, the sorcerer gains limited
comprehension in terms of feelings - but can still communicate.


Teleport
Concentration, Resist (Evade)

Teleport allows a sorcerer to instantaneously move himself, or a target to anywhere
within the range of the spell, as long as the destination is in direct observation, there is
solid footing and no object bars their arrival. If these conditions are not met, the spell
automatically fails. The caster is able to teleport objects up to 3 points of SIZ per 10% of
his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.


Wrack
Concentration, Resist (Resilience)

This spell injures victims by wracking them with magical force. If the target fails to resist, every
Combat Action the sorcerer can inflict a random location with an amount of damage according
to their Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.

1-20% 1D2 damage, 21-40% 1D4, 41-60% 1D6, 61-80% 1D8, 81-100% 1D10, 101-120%
2D6, 121-140% 1D6+1D8, 141-160% 2D8 and so on.

Armour provides no protection but magical defences (such as Countermagic Shield or Spell
Resistance) reduce rolled damage by the Magnitude they normally block (assuming the Wrack
spell penetrates).

There are many versions of this spell that afflict the victim with different torments. For
example one form of Wrack (Darkness) slowly freezes the target with frigid tendrils of
shadow, whereas another might cause their limbs to crack and shatter or simply inflict an
agonising poison.

         guilds, factions and cults

In Legend, few Adventurers stand alone. Most are members of some faction, order or cult. Guilds
are the guardians of secret knowledge and craftsmanship, and often have a commercial focus
coupled with their spiritual or social aspects. Magical orders pass on the secrets of sorcery to the
next generation of apprentices and jealously protect their grimoires and hidden lore. Factions
can be anything from an order of chivalrous knights to a gang of thieves, while cults range from
established religions to fringe cults to spirit-worshipping lodges. Ultimately, what a faction calls
itself is unimportant - what matters is belief and loyalty.


Why Join a Faction?
Adventurers join factions for many reasons but the most common are:

*	   Cultural influence: all members of a particular clan worship a particular god and it has
  always been thus. Faction membership is not just expected but mandatory.
*	   Social advancement: membership of a particular guild or order is required to master a craft
  or a form of sorcery.
*	   Reinforce beliefs and behaviours: faction members cleave to a particular ideal or way of
  behaving and, in the faction, find a way of both expressing it and being rewarded for it.
*	   Power, Glory and Status: Rising through the faction’s ranks brings magical power, as
  explored earlier in Divine Magic but aside from that, factions offer rewards in the form of
  training and, perhaps, other gifts.


Cults
A cult is any body of people who come together in veneration of a common symbol. This could be a
god, a spirit or ancestor, an ideal or even a heroic personality. Cults fulfil many purposes: protection,
progress and tuition, enlightenment and very often they are the focus for a complete community.

Where divine cults are concerned, a god may have several cults dedicated to different aspects of
the god’s personality. Thus a single god may have many cults or just one, embracing all aspects
of the god’s nature.

Cults are not limited to gods or spirits: a cult can form around a hero or heroine or even around
a religious or philosophical ideal.


Guilds
Guilds are associations of those who practice a particular profession or craft. All the jewellers in
a city might belong to the jeweller’s guild, all the blacksmiths to the blacksmith’s guild and so
forth. Each guild possesses certain secret techniques and methods that are revealed only to those
who prove themselves worthy to learn them.


                                                                                                         209

       Guilds wield vast political and economic power. Any craftsman or merchant who tries to operate
without guild sanction will be shunned and driven out of business by the guild. Guildmasters
have as much influence as any lord or high priest. Many long-established guilds take a mystical
approach to their craft or profession, worshipping gods or spirits associated with the craft and
practicing magical techniques.

Not all guilds are publicly known or tolerated - thieves, mercenaries or assassins may also form
secret underworld guilds.


Sorcerous Orders
Sorcerous orders are gatherings of sorcerers and scholars. Learning the art of Sorcery takes many
years of hard study, so sorcery is usually passed from master to a small handful of dedicated
apprentices. Sorcerous orders are largely defined by the grimoires they possess - the most
powerful orders have an extensive library of occult books. Such a library might contain as many
as five or six unique grimoires, together with hundreds of commentaries, glosses, histories and
related books of lore.

Unlike guilds, most sorcerous orders exist on the fringes of society. Sorcerers bend the laws
of reality and summon up ghastly horrors from beyond the stars, so they are often feared and
abhorred by right-thinking folk.



Martial Orders
Brave martial orders may be dedicated to a particular kingdom, or a deity, or an ideal. Membership
of a chivalrous order is the dream of every noble warrior and squire but not all martial orders are
made up of knights in shining armour. A martial order can also be a monastery of fighting monks
on a distant mountain, or a band of hard-bitten mercenaries. Martial orders may control vast
territories and great castles, and be possessed of considerable wealth and political power. Some
orders even have divine blessings or secret fighting techniques.


Factions and Magic
The kinds of magic offered vary depending on the faction’s nature.

Divine Cults offer Divine Magic and Common Magic to their members. Divine cults have, as
their focus, a god or a pantheon of gods - beings of Divine power who, through a relationship
with their faithful, extend both their magic and Characteristics to the membership.

Sorcerous Orders may have a god or a particular personality as the object of veneration but the
order itself does not derive its magic from a Divine source, as would a Divine cult. Rather the
order derives its magical power from the direct study of Sorcery, formulating grimoires reflecting
the needs, deeds and myths of its object of veneration. Membership of Sorcerous Order gives
access to one or more of the order’s Grimoires.

Guilds control access to the highest secrets of a particular craft or profession. An Adventurer
who seeks a master capable of teaching the higher levels (75%) of a skill may be required to join
the appropriate guild. Some guilds teach Common Magic related to that guild’s specialty - for
example, a guild of blacksmiths might teach Bladesharp, Repair and Armoursmith’s Boon, while
a guild of thieves might teach Bandit’s Cloak and Abacus.


210

         Martial Orders may teach Common or Divine Magic, depending on their approach to combat.
They often also possess special Heroic Abilities that are available only to their members.

Comparative Rank Titles
Although the different factions have, for the sake of simplicity, the same structure of ranks,
the names given to each rank differ between faction types. The Comparative Rank Titles table
provides the comparisons:

Ranks
Part of the cult framework is to determine what ranks are available and how Adventurers progress
from one to another. The core rank structure is summarised here, along with the advancement
requirements and appropriate benefits. If the cult has any specific duties that members must
perform, they will be outlined in the description of the rank.


Level 0: Common Members
The first step in joining a faction and rising through its ranks is to become a Common Member.
An Adventurer can belong to several factions as a Common Member, as long as they are not
diametrically opposed. The vast majority of members of a faction are Common Members, casual
follows who support and aid the faction.


Level 1: Initiated Members
This is the start of the inner membership of the faction and Initiated Members have to donate
a substantial amount of time and money to the organisation. In return, they receive benefits
denied to Common Members. It is possible for an Adventurer to be an Initiated Member of
more than one faction at a time.


Level 2: Fervent Members
Few members of the faction will rise to the position of Fervent Member, a rank that requires
dedication and service but where the inner secrets of the faction begin to be revealed. Fervent
Members can be Common Members and even Initiated Members of other factions but cannot
be Fervent Members of more than one faction.




                                                                                                211

       Level 3: Masters
Masters are the respected and established leaders of the faction and have full command of the
faction’s secret skills or spells. There is usually only a single master in a given gathering of the
faction.


Level 4: Grand Masters
The leaders of the cult, Grand Masters embody everything the faction stands for and have access
to its deepest secrets. When trouble threatens, it is the Grand Masters who will fight for its
survival and prosperity.

        its status. For example, in a guild, the Fervent
        Member must complete a masterwork and
        present it to the masters; in a martial order,
        the would-be knight must complete a quest.

Masters      cult for at least three years and must have at

212

         Common Magic
Factions can offer Common Magic. The range of Common Magic available may be far wider
than its Divine, Spirit or Sorcery Magic portfolio; or be limited to a handful of spells the faction
finds especially useful. It is therefore not uncommon to see a faction listed as providing ‘All’
Common Magic spells - meaning all the spells found in Legend’s Common Magic chapter.
Similarly some factions may only provide a list of named spells - or may have special Common
Magic spells of their own development.

Divine Magic
The god a faction worships determines what Divine Magic is offered. A war god, for example,
can be expected to have Divine Spells relating to combat and battle; whereas a fertility goddess
can be expected to have spells related with healing and growth. Again, there are no hard and fast
rules here, save the description of the cult and the nature of the deity.

The number of Divine Spells a cult offers depends on the cult’s size and standing. However most
cults will offer around four or five Divine Spells to Pious Members or above.

Sorcery
Those orders following a sorcerous tradition may have an ideal or philosophy as the focus of
veneration, or a particular god, demi-god or saint. The Sorcery spells offered are collectively
known as a grimoire and order members have access to the order’s grimoire or grimoires as
described in the Sorcery chapter.

Faction Skills
These are skills mastered by the cult and considered important to it. Training in these skills
is more or less guaranteed with faction members being able to find access to a teacher via a
temple, academy, school, shrine or through faction contacts. Faction skills are usually trained at
a discount and if so this will be mentioned in the faction’s description.

Additionally increasing competence in faction skills is usually mandatory for Adventurers to
progress from one rank to the next. Thus, when considering training and spending Improvement
Rolls, Adventurers need to consider and then balance-up, faction advancement requirements.


Sample Cults
Three cults are presented here as examples.


The Cult of the Thunderer (Divine Cult)
The warrior-god of the forest-tribes is the Thunderer, who shakes the branches and drives back
the darkness. The forest tribes learned to worship the Thunderer and the rest of their pantheon
from the sea-going barbarians of the north; in the mountains of the north, the Thunderer is
associated with a magic iron hammer but the forest tribes have few ironsmiths. In their rites,
therefore, the Thunderer’s holy weapon is the spear, which symbolises his heavenly thunderbolts.

Warriors of the Thunderer are honour-bound to defend the tribe and hunt down monsters.
Storms are their sacred time and battles or ceremonies conducted amid the thunder and the
howling rain are especially blessed.

Divine Magic: Blessing (any Cult Skill), Crash of Thunder, Lightning Strike, Shield, Channel Strength.


                                                                                                      213

       Membership, Officers and Ranks
Lay Members
Lay Members are any who support the warriors and are prepared to offer worship at the shrines
of the Thunderer.

Initiates
Initiates must have five cult skills at a minimum of 30%. They must all dedicate at least 1 POW
to their Pact with the Thunderer.

Acolytes
Acolytes of the Thunderer are veteran warriors and protectors of the tribe. Acolytes must have
slain an enemy of the tribe, have five cult skills of at least 50% dedicating at least 3 POW to their
Pact with the Thunderer. The Pact skill must also be at a minimum of 50%.

Priests
Priest of the cult oversee ceremonies and keep the sacred fire of the Thunderer. They must also
dedicate at least 5 POW to their Pact with the Thunderer. Five cult skills must be 80% or higher
and the Pact skill must also be 80% or higher. As the heroes of the cult, they are expected to
challenge all enemies of the Thunderer wherever they are found.

High Priests
High Priests are given the gift of prophecy and can hear the future in the words of the thunder.
They must dedicate at least 7 POW to their pact and have five cult skills including Pact at 100%.

The cult offers training in the following skills. Pact is mandatory as one of the five skills for
joining and advancing within the cult: Acrobatics, Athletics, Common Magic, Evade, Pact (the
Thunderer), Perception, Resilience, any Spear style.


Order of the Black Serpent (Sorcery Order)
The Order of the Black Serpent follows the teachings of Menakhem Ka, the insane demi-god of
the Ziggurat of the Eclipse. His desire to become a true god was articulated in his blasphemous
grimoire before he departed into the depths of the great desert.

Since then, the order has swollen in size from the original eight disciples and now numbers some
800 eager, would-be gods who seek to overthrow the established order wherever they establish
one of their heretical schools.

Magic
Common Magic: Disruption, Mobility and Speedart

Sorcery (Black Serpent Grimoire): Animate (Sand), Dominate (Serpent), Form/Set (Sand),
Shapechange (Human to Serpent).

Heroic Abilities: Immunity to Poison; Reincarnate as Black Snake.

Guild of Assassins
Go down a certain street in a certain desert town and knock on the white door. An old man
will greet you, offer you mint tea, and talk with you for a time. Tell him your woes and your
troubles, and describe to him certain individuals who have caused you distress. He will listen
to you, saying nothing, perhaps even seeming to sleep but when you get up to leave, the old
man will hand you a pebble. If it is black, then nothing more will happen but if it is white,
those troublesome individuals will die - and the old man will find you, someday, and demand
payment for these deaths.




                                                                                                    215

       The Assassin’s Guild are not a band of hired thugs or murderers. They are adjusters on the scales
of life, weighing one man’s virtues against another. Would the city be better off if the young
prince ruled instead of the old king? Which priestess should lead the temple? They only kill if
their victim deserves death according to their cryptic methodology.

At the lower ranks of the guild, the Assassins are willing to employ thieves, rogues and Adventurers
as assassins; however, only those dedicated to the cause of death may ascend to the higher ranks.

Abilities taught by the guild. They must spend at least six months of the year in residence at one
of the guild’s secret strongholds.

Grand Master
The Grand Master must have at least five of the guild skills at 90% and obtain all three of the
Heroic Abilities. The Grand Master dwells in the guild’s headquarters.

Guild Skills
The guild offers training in: Craft (Poison), Resilience, Stealth, Any Dagger style, Any Bow style,
Sorcery (Black Serpent Grimoire) and Manipulation.




216

         Alaric’s Tale - Cult of the Thunderer
Alaric dwells in the Gloamwood amid barbaric tribes.

At the age of 21 all warriors of the tribe are expected to become initiates of the Thunderer cult
and Alaric is no exception. On his 21st birthday he is taken into the tribe’s most sacred shrine
where he must undergo certain testing rituals - of his courage, his magic and his understanding
of the Thunderer.

The cult skills are Spear fighting, Lore (The Thunderer), Evade, Perception and Common
Magic. Alaric has each of these skills at more than 30% and so passes the tests involving his skills.

Next is his commitment to the cult: this is sealed through Alaric establishing a Pact with the
Thunderer. In a deeply mystical ceremony Alaric is tested with fire and words and, in the final
act, ascends the bare hill above the shrine to stand and glory in the full force of an oncoming
storm. This rite creates the Pact (the Thunderer) and Alaric’s player enters this onto his character
sheet. Alaric dedicates 4 POW to the Pact, making his Pact (The Thunderer) 14% (CHA + 4
dedicated POW). He is now an initiate of the cult and bound by its teachings.

The benefits Alaric derives from his cult are as follows:

*	 Alaric can learn the cult’s Divine Magic spells and cast them at Lore (The Thunderer) 52%.
  The inherent Magnitude for any Divine Spell he casts is equal to his Pact divided by 10 and
  rounded up, so Alaric’s Divine Spells will have a Magnitude of 2. As his Pact deepens, so will
  the potency of his Divine Magic. He can also pray for up to four Divine Spells - the amount
  of his POW dedication. Alaric learns, through his initiation and later progress in the cult,
  Lightning Strike, Shield, Bless (Spear & Shield) and Channel Strength.

*	 He can gain access to training in the cult’s skills at a much reduced cost with dedicated
  teachers. The cult also specialises in several Common Magic spells, which again Alaric can
  learn at reduced cost and with dedicated teachers.

*	 Most importantly, Alaric has the support of the entire cult behind him. As an Initiate he
  will be expected to work long and hard for the cult but in return he will be able to call
  upon colleagues and fellow cultists for help or advice. Furthermore, initiation into the cult
  marks Alaric as a warrior within the tribe and this is a moment of great pride for the young
  Adventurer.




                                                                                                     217

                                         heroic abilities

What separates a hero from an Adventurer?

Actions, deeds, reputation and history, obviously, but in some cases a hero is defined by his
capabilities. A lucky few demonstrate innate talents that distinguish them from the rank and file.
These talents and capabilities are known as Heroic Abilities.

Heroic Abilities are powers and enhancements available through seeking reclusive masters,
HeroQuesting supernatural gifts, divine blessings or progression within a cult. Adventurers gain
these abilities, which augment their existing skills and magic, as rewards for heroic aspirations
and actions.

Gaining a Heroic Ability is not as simple as training in a skill or buying a spell. Heroic Abilities
need to be earned and usually in one of the following ways:

*	 Attaining a certain rank, usually Level 3 or Level 4, in a faction.
*	 Undertaking epic or heroic quests, either as part of cult business or some other endeavour
decided by the Games Master.
*	 Studying with another hero - learning from them, emulating them and, eventually,
developing a similar technique.

At their simplest, Heroic Abilities are gained once an Adventurer has accrued enough Hero
Points to buy one. However, this should never be the sole criteria for gaining a Heroic Ability.
Games Masters should bear in mind that a Heroic Ability is not a piece of merchandise that an
Adventurer can pick up at the market after accumulating enough ‘money’ in the form of Hero
Points. These are rare and wonderful abilities, not merely an ‘Adventurer sheet upgrade’. In order
to learn these abilities, an Adventurer must have proved himself heroically and not simply on
a one-off endeavour. True heroes continue to live up to their reputations and are prepared to
undergo countless hazards with a more or less selfless outlook.

Thus, although an Adventurer might reach the rank of, say, Priest in a church and thereby
become eligible for a Heroic Ability (if his cult offers them) he is not necessarily entitled to add
it to his Adventurer sheet. The Games Master may very well require the Adventurer to earn the
Heroic Ability through a specific scenario or further adventure.

On some occasions Adventurers will encounter heroes who already have Heroic Abilities and
seek to learn from this master. This is permissible of course but no self respecting hero will ever
gladly, easily or freely impart knowledge and expertise that he has spent years earning unless
the prospective pupil demonstrates his own worth. Even though a student wanting to learn
a Heroic Ability might have the right amount of Hero Points to spend, the Games Master is
fully within his rights to insist on the Adventurer proving himself in some fashion before the
Heroic Ability is taught.


218

         Using Heroic Abilities
The description of the ability indicates how it is used in game play. However, invoking a Heroic
Ability always costs the Adventurer one Magic Point whenever it is used. Although Heroic
Abilities are not magical powers, they are, to some extent, fuelled by the same reserves that
power Common Magic. Invoking a Heroic Ability involves delving into one’s own character,
channelling the intangible forces that fire deeds of heroism.

To invoke a Heroic Ability no Skill Test is needed; simply the spending of one Magic Point and
the clear statement of the ability to be used in advance of any Skill Test it applies to.

The duration of the ability is given in its description and at the end of the ability’s duration, its
effects end. The Adventurer can invoke the ability again immediately afterwards, as long as he
has the Magic Points to do so and as long as the ability’s effects do not leave him incapacitated
(through fatigue, for instance).

parrying, armour or magic. If the victim strikes any obstacle they smash into it, fall prone and
automatically receive the attacker’s Damage Bonus to a random location, ignoring any protection.


Battle Fury
Requirements: CON 15 or higher, any Close Combat Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 12
Duration: A number of melee rounds equal to CON

You are a terrible foe on the battlefield, as fearsome and unstoppable as a raging wild boar. You
can enter a Battle Fury as a Combat Action. While in a Battle Fury, you automatically succeed
in any Resilience roll required for sustaining a Serious or Major Wound. You also automatically
succeed in any Persistence roll when resisting mental or emotional attacks. Upon leaving Battle
Fury, you automatically gain three levels of Fatigue.




                                                                                                     219

       Born to the Saddle
Requirements: POW 15 or higher, Riding 90% or higher
Hero Points: 8
Duration: Until the terrain or situation has been cleared, or if in combat, a number of melee
rounds equal to CON

Sitting in the saddle is more natural to you than walking. Each time this ability is invoked you
may ignore any and all riding based situational modifiers for terrain or the mount’s behaviour.
In addition you may use your Riding skill instead of your Evade skill when evading missiles.


Dead Eye
Requirements: DEX 15 or higher, any ranged Weapon skill at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One missile attack

Your accuracy with either thrown or projected missile weapons (whichever type you have mastery
in) is the stuff of legends. Invoking this ability allows you to increase the range of your chosen
type of missile weapons by 50% and if you successfully hit you may automatically select the
location struck - permitting you to bypass the effects of anything less than total cover.


Defiant Leap
Requirements: STR 15 or higher, Athletics 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One extraordinary jump

You are able to defy gravity when performing a single vertical or horizontal jump. You may roll
your Damage Bonus and add this value in metres to the distance achieved.


Deflecting Parry
Requirements: DEX 15 or higher, any Close Combat Weapon Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One parry

You may increase the size of your parrying weapon or shield by two steps for a single parry. This
might allow an unarmed defender to ward off a halberd, or the user of a buckler to deflect a
mounted lance attack.


Disease Immunity
Requirements: CON 15 or higher, Resilience 70% or higher
Hero Points: 8
Duration: Continuous - body automatically burns 1 Magic Point when it is infected

You are immune to all normal diseases. Each time you are exposed to a disease, your body
unconsciously invokes this ability and purges the infection. Magical diseases will still affect you,
though you gain a +20% bonus to tests to resist them.




220

         Duellist
Requirements: DEX 15 or higher, any 1H Combat Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One melee round

Mastery of your chosen duelling weapon allows you, for brief moments, to react with blinding
speed. As a free act you can invoke this ability to grant yourself a single extra Combat Action for
that round. This extra CA may only be used for attacks or parries.


Empathic Wound
Requirements: POW 15 or higher, Influence skill at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One injury

One of the more unusual of the Heroic Abilities, Empathic Wound is a dangerous and taxing
ability and is normally only used by those who shun or forswear violence. When invoked, any
damage you suffer from being harmed is mirrored upon your attacker, whether it be from
torture, stuck by a weapon, or targeted by a spell. Your inviolate sanctity causes the assailant to
psychosomatically or mystically suffer the exact same effects of any damage caused to you.


Heroic Aura
Requirements: CHA 15 or higher, Influence skill at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 12
Duration: One melee round

Your presence is not only heartening to your comrades, you are also a shining example to others.
You may take a Combat Action to bolster all allies within your CHA in metres with your
presence, either gaining your CHA as a bonus to any Persistence or Resilience tests they are
called upon to make, or as a bonus to all Combat Styles for the remainder of the Combat Round.


Linguist
Requirements: INT 15 or higher, two Language skills (aside from your native tongue) at 50%
or higher
Hero Points: 8
Duration: Several hours

Your study of languages has taught you the common roots of all tongues, allowing you to pick
up new foreign languages with startling ease. Invoking this ability, you must either converse with
a speaker of a strange language for one hour, or simply hear the language being spoken for two
or more hours. You then automatically gain the Language skill in that language at its basic score.
A successful Improvement roll when improving a Language skill doubles the skill points gained
(roll 2D4+2 rather than 1D4+1).




                                                                                                   221

       Loremaster
Requirements: INT 15 or higher, four Lore skills at 50% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One recall attempt

You are a font of knowledge, possessed of more learning than even you can readily remember.
Any time you fail a Lore Skill Test, you are entitled to make an immediate Persistence test (with
the same modifiers as the original Lore test) to see if you can recall some shred of knowledge
relating to the subject at hand. Typically, this will reveal less information than a successful Lore
test would have but it should still be enough to be of benefit to you.


Mighty Blow
Requirements: STR 15 or higher, any Close Combat Weapon Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One melee attack

You can increase the size of your weapon by two steps for a single attack. This helps the blow
overwhelm any parry which intercepts it, allowing damage to penetrate.


Poison Immunity
Requirements: CON 15 or higher, Resilience 70% or higher
Hero Points: 8
Duration: Continuous - body automatically burns 1 Magic Point when it is poisoned

You are immune to all normal poisons. Each time you are poisoned, your body unconsciously
invokes this ability and purges the toxin. Magical poisons will still affect you, though you gain a
+20% bonus to tests to resist them.


Reincarnation
Requirements: POW 15 or higher, Pact, Sorcery (Grimoire) 90% or higher
Hero Points: 12
Duration: One Use

Upon death you are reincarnated as an animal or creature reflecting the runic affiliation or nature
of your cult. Your physical Characteristics (STR, CON, SIZ and DEX) become those of the
creature you are reborn into but your INT, POW and CHA remain those of the Adventurer. This
Heroic Ability does not require a Magic Point to use. It can only be used once and it is gone.




222

         Severing Slash
Requirements: DEX 15 or higher, any cutting Weapon Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One melee attack

If wielding a cutting weapon, you can maximise its damage for a single blow.


Sundering Strike
Requirements: STR 15 or higher, any Close Combat Weapon Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 12
Duration: One melee attack

You can smash or cleave an inanimate object with no harm to your weapon. Any damage you roll
completely ignores the Armour Points of the object. Thus you could cut a chain, or smash a door
with a single blow. If attacking an opponent’s weapon, you must succeed in the attack and equal
or beat the opponent’s level of success to successfully strike the parrying object.


Tireless
Requirements: CON 15 or higher, Athletics 90% or higher
Hero Points: 8
Duration: Special

Your stamina is Heroic, allowing you to continue fighting or working long after others drop from
exhaustion. Each time you invoke this ability you reduce your Fatigue by one level.


Wall Leaping
Requirements: DEX 15 or higher, Acrobatics 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One round of running

Displaying incredible agility, you can run along or up walls for short distances to escape or gain
a better position against an enemy. You may only use Wall Leaping if not Overloaded, Exhausted
or Debilitated. The entirety of your Movement in a Combat Round may be made along a
vertical surface, allowing you to bypass an obstruction that might otherwise block your path
or even climb a wall at lightning speed. However, you cannot continue moving along a vertical
surface from Combat Round to Combat Round - you must reach level ground (or a suitable
perch) by the end of your last Combat Action in a round or fall.




                                                                                                  223

           gamesmastering legend

This chapter offers specific advice to Games Masters, both novice and veteran, on running
Legend and getting the most out of it. It includes specific advice regarding key themes in Legend,
rules and guidance on a variety of situations likely to arise that may not necessarily be addressed
by specific rules in the earlier chapters, plus some guidance on creating scenarios for Legend.

As with any amount of guidance, the material found in this chapter is here to suggest and
prompt ideas and creativity: it is not intended to be prescriptive. A tenet to always bear in mind
is ‘Forge Your Own Legend’, meaning that, as Games Master, how you choose to use these rules
and how you want to develop your game should always take precedence. There are few rules in
this book that cannot be modified in some way and Games Masters are encouraged to tinker
with, alter and ignore rules that do not fit their style of play or campaign objectives.

Themes
One of the hallmarks of Legend is the way in which certain themes are handled, both as part of
the rules and during game play. The mechanics of the system engender a certain style of play
that emphasises Adventurer development, skill-use and an approach to the wider community
above simply killing monsters, avoiding traps and accumulating treasure. Not that these things
are unimportant or wrong; more that Legend places a different emphasis on adventuring. This
section examines themes Games Masters may wish to keep in mind when developing scenarios
for play and then running them with players.

Community
Community and relationships are integral to Legend. Adventurers do not exist in isolation; they
have pasts, families, social and cultural groups they belong to or have belonged to and the rules
encourage ongoing community interaction through the joining of cults.

The rules for establishing Cultural Background and community in the Adventurer Creation
chapter provide a template for Adventurers to establish certain things before play begins: where
they come from, who their family is/was, who they know (friends and foes) and key things that
have influenced their lives. These details are deliberately vague to act as a catalyst for players
and Games Masters, working together, to build interesting portraits of Adventurers’ past lives
through discussion, conjecture (‘what if my long-lost twin brother is now an evil sorcerer…?’)
and, hopefully, exploration during play. Using the ideas provided by the Cultural Background and
Community sections Adventurers become far more than a set of figures on an Adventurer sheet:
they have a history, a context and, in many cases, a reason for being. Using the guidance on contacts
and enemies provides a set of plot hooks for further development that keep Adventurers involved
with their history. It is therefore worth investing some time in this part of the Adventurer Creation
process to gain a deeper understanding of the Adventurer and how he might develop during play.

Another aspect of community that is worth exploring is continued attachment to it. In many
roleplaying games the Adventurers are created and embark on their adventures with little or no
thought for the communities that nurtured them. This is different in Legend. In many Legend
settings Adventurers remain within their communities and continue to serve them. Such local
heroics are a key principle of Legend play. Grand quests are certainly important and concern the
Adventurers but often a scenario or set of scenarios focus on serving the daily requirements of the

                                                                                                     225

       clan, tribe, village or town, with little financial reward as the incentive but the thanks and kudos
afforded by the community when the Adventurers are successful. Many very successful Legend
campaigns have concerned the daily lives of the Adventurers, with dangerous quests, epic battles
and dour foes being introduced sporadically, reflecting the more likely nature of such events.
As the Adventurers serve their communities, so they grow with them. Relationships deepen,
their place in the community progresses and, eventually, those lowly Adventurers are chieftains,
champions, lords and kings.

Magic
The availability of magic is reflected in the four magic systems presented in the Legend rules. In
some settings, magic is ubiquitous with even the lowliest primitive having some magical charm
that protects him or aids him in his life. Naturally not all fantasy settings rely on magic to such
an extent and the rules are presented in a way to allow Games Masters to tailor the availability of
magic to the campaign. Low magic settings, for instance, might only have Sorcery available as the
magical system of the world and access to it restricted by culture or taboo. Similarly if the gods of a
world are distant, uncaring beings, Divine Magic might be non-existent or, at best, extremely rare.

Thought therefore needs to be given to the availability of magic and this depends on the setting.
Some examples follow.

*	 In gritty, Sword and Sorcery settings, only sorcery - which is seen as a dark and malevolent
force - is available and then only to the few who are prepared to undergo its corrupting
influence to attain it. Most people are fearful of magic and attempt to limit their exposure
to it, for fear of what it might do to their immortal souls.
*	   In High Fantasy settings Divine Magic and Sorcery may be available but only to certain
races, cults or orders. Common Magic is not something the general populace is exposed to
but it is present and worked by those who use it as a gateway to more refined powers.
*	   Dark Fantasy settings, such as the Eternal Champion series, rely on magicians to be willing
to bargain their very souls for magical power - although all kinds of magic are available to
those willing to enter into such contracts. Magic is sinister, although not necessarily evil and
Adventurers who use it are forever in jeopardy of losing their humanity as they use magic
for whatever ends they have in mind.

Quests
Despite what has been said about community, Adventurers should find themselves engaged in
quests - mundane and magical - for either the thrill of the adventure, to defeat a foe or to
advance or protect their community’s interests.

Magical Quests
Magical quests are a feature of Legend. Adventurers are likely to be engaged in magical quests in
many ways, some of the most common being:

*	   Finding a fabled treasure for the good of the community.
*	   Aiding a sorcerer or other magician in creating a magical treasure through finding
components.
*	   Delving into a myth, dream or Otherworld experience, with a magical treasure or power
as the prize.
*	   Returning a magical treasure to its place of origin or a place of destruction, to avert doom
of some form.
*	   Seeking magical power to advance within a cult or for personal kudos/gain.

Magical quests by their nature usually involve much risk - either in the form of protective magic,
powerful guardians or the nature of the treasure/quest itself. This is the reason for carefully considering
the place of magic in the setting. If magic is rare, then lower levels of magical threat might be employed
as part of the quest: the Adventurers, being unfamiliar with magic largely, are likely to find any degree
of magic daunting and need to counter it with mundane abilities, wits and ingenuity.

226

         If magic is commonplace, then higher and deeper levels of magic are likely to be necessary and
the backing of a cult or sorcerous order is a prime requisite in completing the quest successfully.

Whatever the basis, Legend is not a game that is littered with magical items to be found randomly
as part of a treasure hoard. Magical items are treasured artefacts that are not lost or misplaced
carelessly, nor packed into chests and trunks along with a stash of gold. Magic is never a
commodity in Legend; it is a valuable resource and, as such, needs handling with care, especially
in the case of magical items or the objects of magical quests. Magical quests tend to be focused
affairs that have, at their heart, some measure of life-changing experience - even though the basic
nature of the quest may appear to be mundane.

Factions
Guilds, factions and cults are an important part of Legend. Aside from the obvious advantages
of access to magic, training and information, factions offer several benefits for Games Masters:

Faction membership offers a ready excuse for adventuring. Factions frequently need to defend
themselves against enemy or rival groups and frequently engage in quests of many kinds to
advance their knowledge, power and status. Even low-level faction members can be engaged on
important faction business.

Factions provide an additional layer of community for Adventurers. Usually this will not be at
odds with the Adventurers’ existing communities but, depending on the faction type, it may
offer an interesting conflict leading to interesting, faction versus community stories.

Through factions, the gods and other foci of cult veneration become real and visceral things,
driving and shaping behaviour and destinies. Factions lend purpose and drive to Adventurers
and adventures. Simply joining a faction and being initiated into its ways can form the focus of
several sessions of storytelling.

Of course factions need not play such a large part in a Legend game but their unique place in the
central heart of Legend makes them a natural - and very important - mechanism for developing
adventures that can break away from the usual tropes of fantasy fiction and roleplaying games.
Factions have their own agendas and beliefs which, when explored, lend a satisfying depth to
both character and social development.

Future Legend supplements will develop the factions available - both for specific settings and
generically - allowing Games Masters to take full advantage of the diversity of factions.


A Good Story, Well Told
Legend is concerned very much with both storytelling and Adventurer development. The game
mechanics for Legend, whilst being comprehensive and sophisticated, are intuitive enough to
fade into the background of the game, intruding only when necessary to resolve a particular
outcome. Indeed, Legend’s mechanics should be part of the background as much as possible.
Everything, mechanically, that is needed for Legend, is contained on the Adventurer sheet: skill
values, Hit Points, weapon statistics and so forth. Whilst the Games Master will inevitably need
to refer to the rules during play, most questions can be resolved by consulting the Adventurer
sheet and rolling 1D100 or 1D20.

What this means is that the game session can focus on developing a Good Story, Well Told. The
game mechanics do not drive the story: the Adventurers do - and the bulk of the rules found
in Legend are geared towards investment in the Adventurer: Characteristics, Attributes, Skills,
Combat Styles, Magic and Cult details, each element is designed to invest in the Adventurer
- not the player, Games Master or even the concepts of the game - and enable Adventurers to
shine through as individuals, supported by elements that develop them as part of a group or team
(community, once again). How well Adventurers develop along with the investments the game

                                                                                                   227

       system makes depends very much on the players but in Legend the rules are designed to work
with and for the Adventurers, aiding imagination, providing opportunity and diversity, rather
than reducing either to a series of available or not available, on/off abilities and options.

For the Games Master this theme of storytelling and Adventurer focus means that it is worthwhile
spending time with the players and taking an interest in how their Adventurers are created. Some
tips to consider are:

*	   Help players develop the community section of Adventurer Creation. Have in mind a
common theme that all players can subscribe to and assist in developing close Adventurer
relationships early-on. This establishes a sense of fraternity amongst the players and develops
instant bonds before play begins.
*	   Introduce factions and faction membership reasonably early. Cults are not something to be
withheld until Adventurers reach a certain level; they exist to get Adventurers to a certain
level. And, because factions in many settings for Legend are all around, it makes sense that
faction membership will come sooner rather than later.
*	   Encourage players to think about their skills when coming to make Improvement Rolls.
It is natural to focus on skills for combat and magic but social and knowledge skills are
equally important. Try to encourage diversity amongst the players but have them think ‘in
character’ when choosing which skills to improve. Would a new initiate of a faction really
seek to improve non-faction skills or would he, perhaps, focus on those skills that will
help him gain status in the faction and prove his loyalty? Looking at these mechanics from
a slightly different, Adventurer-driven perspective contributes to developing diverse and
believable Adventurers.

Campaigns and Scenarios
A scenario is a story, played through in one or several sessions of play. A campaign is a linked set
of stories that may or may not have a definite conclusion. One way to differentiate between the
two is to consider scenarios as short stories or chapters of a novel and a campaign as an anthology
of short stories or as the novel itself (or trilogy of novels, if the campaign is of a grand scale).
Campaigns may take months or years to complete - and some are ongoing sagas, reflecting the
lives of the Adventurers.

The Games Master is responsible for presenting the scenario and campaign to the players.
Scenarios tend to fall into one of the following categories:

Published - A pre-written Legend scenario offered for sale or download, either as a one-off adventure
or a complete campaign. Published scenarios take a great deal of the preparatory work out of the
Games Master’s workload allowing play to begin swiftly. However, Games Masters still need to be
familiar with the scenario’s content, structure, themes and goals and it may be that the Games Master
needs to adapt certain elements to fit with his existing campaign, play-style and so forth. If using a
published scenario be prepared to adapt and change elements - perhaps substantial ones!

Home-Written - Here, the Games Master writes the scenario, developing the plot, the
Adventurers and creatures involved, events, encounters and so forth. Writing scenarios can
be time-consuming but allows for the best fit of themes, play-style and plotting to fit with a
campaign. The restrictions come in two forms: the amount of detail and time needed to be
invested in the scenario and the likelihood that the players will want to make choices that fall
outside of what the Games Master has planned. Even the most meticulously planned scenario
can be sidelined by players who choose option C when the Games Master had only planned for
options A and B. However, such diversions can often be the most entertaining (or frustrating) as
the Games Master, forced to improvise, develops new and interesting plots that may complement
or even replace those of the planned scenario. It is therefore quite often better to keep the details
of a home-written scenario as loose and flexible as possible, making it easier to deal with the
unexpected actions and decisions of the players.

228

         Scenario Seeds - A kernel of an idea, often perhaps no longer than a paragraph or a sentence, is
used as the basis of the adventure with the Games Master improvising the action and using stock,
pre-generated or typical creature statistics, to support encounters. Handling a scenario seed is always
a challenge since it requires the Games Master to think on his feet; however, the investment both
players and Games Master make in the overall story may well turn out to be far more rewarding
than if using a home-written or published scenario. This is improvisational story-telling at its best
- although the Games Master’s level of experience is often the key to its success.

However, irrespective of the nature of the scenario, there are some guidelines that benefit every
Games Master and these follow.

Campaign Planning
A campaign is a series of linked scenarios and can be as long or as short as one needs them to
be. Some campaigns last years, charting the full lives of the same Adventurers. Others are more
episodic, ending at an agreed point and picked up again after several years of game time have
passed. In others, new Adventurers might be created to suit the style or theme of the campaign.

Whatever the campaign’s nature, it needs a style. The style is very much dependent on where the
campaign is set, so setting, too, is of utmost importance.

Published settings do a great deal of the background work for the Games Master but may not
be to everyone’s taste or style of play. Self-penned settings, whether historical or fantasy based,
always require a great deal of work and research by the Games Master. Things to consider:

*	   Historical or pure fantasy? If historical, then there is a wealth of material to draw upon, from
  encyclopaedias and text books through to historical settings from other game systems. The
  key thing will be to fit the Legend rules to the requirements of the setting, or be prepared
  to alter the historical context to accommodate the rules (magic is the prime consideration
  here: will your historical setting use magic and, if so, how is it rationalised and explained?
  How will it affect the nature of the world?
*	   If you are creating your own fantasy world, then you have carte-blanche to create what
  you want but remember that most successful and convincing fantasy worlds function to a
  certain set of rules that help make them work and feel real. It is also tempting - and can be
  a great deal of fun - to mix lots of different fantasy elements into a single setting (magic,
  Industrial Revolution machinery, giant robots and so on). If you do this, consider how each
  element impacts on its fellows. Also try to resist throwing too much into the mix at the
  beginning: this can prove overwhelming for the players who may not grasp the nature and
  concepts of the setting as easily as the creator.

Whatever the basis for the setting, be prepared to invest some time in its themes, coherence and
the kinds of stories it will generate. Taking the time to prepare will help the campaign develop
into something memorable rather than something that fizzles out after a few sessions of play.

Presenting the Scenario
As Games Master it is your task to present the scenario to the players. How you handle this is
a matter of personal style; some Games Masters like to have prepared notes concerning all the
important things the Adventurers can see, hear and feel, whilst others prefer to focus on details
concerning the story at hand. In time you will develop a style that is uniquely yours but, to assist
in developing that style, some pointers for scenario presentation are as follows.

Preparation: Some preparation is always necessary, although the degree of prep depends on the
Games Master’s confidence, the nature of the scenario and the campaign and, more often than
not, time. If using a published scenario you should have read it at least once and made notes on
changes you need to make, based on what you know of the players and Adventurers, including,
where necessary, amendments to encounter statistics to make the scenario rewarding but neither


                                                                                                       229

       too easy or too hard. If using your own material then notes on the general flow of the story,
encounters and so on will be necessary but need not be extensive. Bullet-points or one-line notes
concerning the importance of a Non-Player Character, an event, encounter and so forth may be
enough. It is common for the flow of play to determine which details need lengthy description
and what can be summarised in a simple sentence: very often, the areas where lots of description
has been lavished are those that least require it - usually because the action leading up to that
point has helped create a strong enough mental image in the players’ minds.

Statistics: It is not necessary to create, from scratch, monsters, creatures and Non-Player
Characters. Use samples from published adventures if you do not have time to create your own
but even then, it is not always necessary to roll the Characteristics for every single trollkin in a
group of 20 - use the average value given in a creature’s description, instead. Even then, you may
only need a handful of statistics: Magic Points, Combat Actions, Movement, Combat Skills,
Persistence and Resilience and a couple of major skills, such as Athletics and Evade. If you use
General Hit Points for underlings and minor Adventurers, as outlined in the Combat chapter,
then you may not even need to use the Hit Locations, either. The watchword is expedience:
where statistics are concerned, note down only what you are certain to use. If other values
are needed for some reason, then there is nothing wrong with a little improvisation as long as
percentages you use reflect that nature of the creature and fit the general risk of the scenario. All
creatures are different - just like Adventurers!

Book Keeping
Keeping track of how Adventurers develop and progress is as important for the Games Master as
the players. By keeping a note of Adventurer’s key skills, their levels, magic and magnitudes and
so forth, scenarios can be more easily tailored to the capabilities of the Adventurers, thus keeping
them challenged and rewarded. Things Games Masters should note, in some form:

*	   Gains or losses of possessions and equipment.
*	   Community - parents, siblings, uncles and aunts: how many, where they live and who they
are. Use this information for scenario inspiration and background colour. Rescuing a family
member from peril is often far more emotionally rewarding than a random Non-Player
Character invented for the sake for the scenario.
*	   Training and mentoring - what have the Adventurers trained in recently? How was the
relationship with the trainer? Does training come at something more than a financial cost?
Do Adventurers need to prove what they have learned before more training is available?
*	   Magic - how was magic improved or more spells learned? As with training, there may be an
onus on the Adventurers to do something in return.
*	   Major foes, rivals and enemies. Having recurring villains and antagonists helps bring a
scenario to life and mirrors popular fiction and drama. Note also how the relationship with
these antagonists changes with circumstances - a deadly foe might need to become an ally
for a while, in certain circumstances.
*	   Skills - what skills do the Adventurers routinely improve? How are they changing compared
with other skills and the other adventurers? Games Masters might need to make suggestions
for helping an Adventurer to remain balanced and some skills, particularly those related to
cults, might need more attention than others.

If the campaign has truly engaged the players much of the book keeping will be collaborative as
the scope of the campaign will be discussed between scenarios and game sessions. This is to be
encouraged as it helps to maintain momentum and involvement. The players gain a true stake in
their Adventurers, resulting in a richer, more rewarding experience.

Risk
How hard is the scenario for the Adventurers? If the dangers and encounters they face are too
easy, then little challenge or threat is posed and the players may feel short-changed as a result.
Although players like to succeed, few players want to have had an easy ride. Likewise, if the
scenario is too tough, resulting in lots of wounds or Adventurer deaths, the players may feel

230

         hard-done by: success should not be a certainty but then again, neither should instant death: the
scenario needs to balance risk.

A reasonable way of approaching risk is to look at the skills of the Adventurers - combat and
magical skills, certainly, but also skills that will aid fight, flight and negotiation. How high are the
skills, generally? What is the highest skill possessed by any one Adventurer? How much magic
and at what Magnitude do they have it? Are there any special things the Adventurers have that
can aid them - contacts, cult affiliations and so on - that they can call upon if things become
very tough?

Now, gauge the strength of the threats, especially Combat Encounters that the Adventurers are
likely to face. If using a published scenario, adjust the skills and magic of the encounters and, if
using your own material, create the encounters at a suitable level.

What constitutes a suitable level depends on the nature of the reward or objective of the scenario
but, in general, use the following checklist:

*	 Skills of enemies should not be more than 20% higher than the average opposing skills of
  the Adventurers. Around a third of the creatures should be around 20% lower, representing
  easy challenges, one third about the same and one third 20% higher. Of course, particular
  Non-Player Characters may have much higher skills reflecting their status and position but
  think long and hard about whether or not such encounters will result in a conflict and, if
  so, what resources the Adventurers have to help them deal with it.
*	   Consider what Combat Manoeuvres foes will use in combat ahead of the encounters. Might
  they have favoured combinations or specialities? Do not rely on manoeuvres that inflict
  high amounts of damage - like Bypass Armour and Maximise Damage - all the time;
  think creatively about the encounter’s aims, skills and nature; not all fights should end in
  death. Jot down these options next to the encounter’s statistics. Do not be afraid to vary
  them according to the nature of the fight but also try to remain consistent with your plans.
  Knowing that the elves of Grimwood Forest always try to Pin Weapon as a first Combat
  Manoeuvre can assist the Adventurers in their own strategies and may encourage them to
  use different tactics for different foes.
*	   Enemies should have roughly the same Magnitude of spells available to them as the
  Adventurers. Challenging opponents may have a few extra Magnitude more but spread
  around different spells and effects. Thus, if the Adventurers tend to have an average
  Magnitude of 4 in typical Common Magic spells, an opponent might have Bladesharp 5 or
  6 but not Bladesharp 10.

Scenario Aids
This section provides some additional rules and reference materials to assist Games Masters in
presenting and planning scenarios. None of these rules additions or the encounter tables are
compulsory; they are here to act as inspiration and, when necessary, a fast way of providing
colour, information or spurs for action.

Weather
Weather conditions can be of importance in any scenario. Some spells affect the weather or rely
on certain kinds of weather for their effect; poor weather can inhibit travel or other activities.
Weather therefore includes wind strength, cloud cover, temperature and rain (precipitation).

Wind
Wind has an STR score, determining its effect on objects and the landscape. If a random wind
STR is needed, roll 1D100 and divide the result by two, rounding up.

Where a wind can disturb and carry loose material, which may affect visibility, the percentage
reduction in visibility for Perception rolls and other skills relying on sight is half the wind’s STR
and equal to the wind’s STR for using Perception to listen or scent something. A hurricane, for
                                                                                                        231

       example, reduces visibility (and Perception rolls) by a minimum of 23% for the purposes of sight
but 46% for the purposes of hearing and scent.

Cloud Cover
The amount of visible sky is determined by cloud cover. The cloud cover percentage also
determines the percentage chance of rainfall in any six hour period. For randomly determined
cloud cover, roll 1D100 and adjust by season:

Spring	   +0
Summer	   -20
Autumn	   +10
Winter	   +20

Rain scales of Very Heavy and above may cause local flooding, landslides and so forth, according
to the terrain.

Percentage of Cover       Scale of Cover         Rain Duration        Scale of Rain

         Depending on the time of year and the ambient temperature, precipitation may well be snow rather
than rain. If so, the Scale of Rain entries should be read as Snow Depth instead, and the value doubled.

Travel and Encounters
Adventurers will, most likely, spend a good deal of their time travelling. Often it is enough to
simply state ‘after three uneventful days, you reach the outskirts of the city’ but in many scenarios
or stories, the journey is the story, with the method of travel and the things that happen whilst
travelling forming the core of the adventure.

Encounter tables are provided for a variety of situations, useful for improvising or acting as the
catalyst for a planned encounter.

Getting There
The cost of travel depends primarily upon the standard of living maintained. Adventurers
travelling by land can, ostensibly, travel for free, provided they are willing to walk the entire
distance, gather or kill their own food on the way and sleep beneath the bushes at night. Such a
method of travel is slow and exhausting, however, and Adventurers will often need to move from
place-to-place in a hurry.

Be aware that the distances shown on the Comparative Movement Table represent the optimum
for unencumbered Adventurers; but weather conditions, terrain, armour and other burdens will
inevitably reduce the rates of travel. There is no hard and fast rule on how local conditions will
affect travel distances but use the following as a guide:

Terrain
Rough terrain (few roads, lots of inclines and hills)          Half
Inhospitable terrain (dense forests, deserts, mountains)       Three Quarters

Travel Costs
The costs for land travel on the Travel Expenses table assume the Adventurers are using one
or more pack animals and are spending their nights in some kind of shelter. These costs are
meant to be used as guidelines by the Games Master. There are a variety of factors that may
increase or decrease the cost for any manner of travel. If the Adventurers are renowned heroes,
for example, the merchant caravan will probably not charge them anything (and may even pay
the Adventurers) to travel with them, on the assumption the Adventurers will be able to deal
efficiently with any threat. On the other hand, if the Adventurers are known to have enemies that
have, in the past, attacked and destroyed ships they were travelling on a ship’s captain may refuse
to allow them on board without adding a zero to the end of the daily cost of passage.

There are no variations in the costs given for different settlement sizes, as it is assumed Adventurers
travelling for any length of time will pass through hamlets, towns, cities and wilderness.

Encounters
Whilst many days may go by before a traveller encounters another soul, when that encounter happens,
it might be significant. Travellers face the hazards of banditry but also fellow travellers or encounters
made on the open road might be a source of news, information or even further adventures.

Use these encounters as random events to spice-up a period of travel, or as the basis for a crafted
encounter leading up to the next crucial event in a story. The encounters are divided into terrain
types but the Nature of Encounter table is common to all encounter tables.
