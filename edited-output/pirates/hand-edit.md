# Introduction

- From A General History of the Robberies & Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates

The golden age of piracy lasted only three or four decades, yet its mythic legacy has endured
now for two or three centuries. While piracy - taking and robbing ships at sea - is ancient, and
continues to this day, the common concept of the pirate, with his devilish ways, his regalia of
pistols and parrots and skulls, his cant and his cruelty is defined by that golden age, by the period
roughly from 1680 to 1720, when the pirates were hunted down by the English Royal Navy.
This book brings the pirates of that era - and other times - to life in Legend campaigns.

The Players and the Games Master should familiarise themselves with the Legend rules as found
in the Legend Core Rulebook. When they are happy they know how to play the game then it is off
to The Making of a Pirate chapter to roll up their pirates, with visits to the Reputation, Legendary
Abilities & Vices, Chattels Blades & Gunshot and Crews & Sworn Companions chapters to round
out the Adventurers.

Both Ships & the Sea and the acts of Piracy & Plunder are described in the chapters of the same
titles, while Combat on the High Seas gives rules for all manner of encounters and battles. Ports,
Trade and the Law gives Adventurers a place to hide out and sell their ill-gotten gains. Finally
there are several different styles of play open to the group, which are discussed in the Campaigns
chapter.



# The Making of a Pirate
Before touching the dice, discuss your pirate with the other players and the Games Master. A
beginning Adventurer is a young pirate, at the start of his career. Maybe he has just joined a
pirate crew, or maybe that will happen in his first adventure.


## Adventurer Generation
Pirates of Legend are created using the standard rules from the Legend Core Rulebook, with the
following changes.


### Part 0: Initial Concept
Why is your Adventurer a pirate? Did he run away to the sea for plunder? To escape a cruel master?
Out of desperation? Perhaps he was kidnapped by a pirate crew, because he is a talented carpenter
or gunner? Does he dream of retiring from the sea when he has enough money to buy the hand of
some pretty girl, or will he be satisfied only with a mansion and a title and a pardon from the King?
Does he want revenge on a particular foe, or does he want to send all humanity to hell?


### Part 1: Characteristics
No changes.


### Part 2: Attributes
No changes.


### Part 3: Basic Skills
There are two new basic weapon skills, Pistols and Longarms. See page 31 for descriptions of
gunpowder weapons.

Many Legend weapons are no longer in common use in the era of pirates. Shields, spears,
hammers, flails and most swords are now relegated to museums or primitive barbaric tribes, as
are bows and crossbows. Common weapons are rapiers and cutlasses, daggers, pikes and other
polearms, and guns of all sorts.


### Part 4: Previous Experience
Primitives and Barbarians may add Longarms +10% to their list of available weapon skills.

Nomads may add both Pistols +10% and Longarms +10% to their list of available weapon skills.
They may also add Courtesy to the list of Advanced skills they can pick.

Civilised may add both Pistols +15% and Longarms +15% to their list of available weapon skills.
They also automatically get the Courtesy skill.

A list of common Professions for pirate campaigns is given here but a follower of any profession
at all could end up as a pirate. Among the pirates, a man's past life was considered irrelevant and
many became pirates to escape some tragedy in their backgrounds.

A few of these professions deserve extra descriptions. The word 'Buccaneer' has become
synonymous with 'pirate' but it originally referred to outcasts and runaways who fled to the
beaches of obscure islands, living on wild pigs, which they barbecued on wood racks called
boucans. They were outlaws, the dregs of society for the most part, and often became pirates.
Gentry are quite the opposite - wealthy people of noble blood, such as governors' daughters.
'Entertainer' covers everything from acrobats to whores, although pirates tended to be fonder
of the latter.

#### Starting Money
An Adventurer's starting money is calculated in Spanish reales, which are roughly equal in value
to Legend silver coins.

In addition to an Adventurer's starting money, he gets the set trappings of his profession and
also some random equipment, reflecting the take-what-you-can-get randomness of the pirate
lifestyle. See the Random Starting Equipment table.


## Advanced Skills

### Gunnery (INT+DEX)
This covers the loading, aiming and firing of cannons and other shipboard weapons, as well as
making grenades and powder bombs. It also teaches the Adventurer how to properly store and
maintain such weapons.


### Cooking (INT+POW)
While anyone can roast a wild pig or throw a few carrots into a pot, it takes skill and talent to
make edible meals aboard a ship. A good cook is welcome among pirates.

### Handiwork (INT)
This is the skill of making basic repairs and jury-rigging equipment. Handiwork can substitute
for most Craft skills when it comes to maintaining and repairing a damaged vessel but cannot
be used for more complex tasks. An Adventurer could use Handiwork to make a simple dug-out
canoe, for example, but not to build a galleon.


#### Advanced Characters
These basic rules create pirates at the start of their careers, just after they have joined a pirate
crew. Older, more seasoned Adventurers can be created using the rules for advanced Adventurer.

The rules for advanced Adventurer are used as normal in Pirates of Legend; characters get free
Legendary Abilities instead.

A Seasoned Adventurer starts with one Legendary Ability, with a maximum Hero Point cost of
2 or less.

A Veteran Adventurer starts with up to two Legendary Abilities, with a maximum total Hero
Point cost of 4 or less.

A Master Adventurer starts with up to three Legendary Abilities, with a maximum total Hero
Point cost of 8 or less.

A Veteran Adventurer starts with up to four Legendary Abilities, with a maximum total Hero
Point cost of 12 or less.


### Part Five - Finishing Touches
Pirates of Legend Adventurers get Free Skill Points as normal.

Pirates of Legend Adventurers all have a Reputation, which is calculated slightly differently to the
standard Reputation.

Pirates of Legend Adventurers get Hero Points as normal. An Adventurer starts with two Hero
Points.

Pirates of Legend Adventurers may take up to two points in Vices.

**Next, move onto the rules for creating a crew and a ship.**


### Random Starting Equipment
In the anarchic ports frequented by the pirates, items change hands regularly. Pawnshops do a
roaring trade, while thieves scavenge from the losers in a brawl in a bar or a duel in an alleyway
and inveterate gamblers or drunkards give up prized treasures for another hand of cards or bottle
of rot-gut rum. Pirate Adventurers, therefore, tend to have an assortment of odd items and
strange possessions that may or may not come in useful.

# Reputation, Legendary Abilities and Vices

## Reputation
Reputation takes on renewed importance in Pirates of Legend, as an Adventurer's Reputation
translates into influence on board ship. It is calculated somewhat differently but otherwise
functions in the same way as described in the Legend Core Rulebook.

##### Starting Reputation

Circumstance                                                        Reputation Modifier

Per other Characteristic over 15                                    +1

Rapier, 1H Sword, Longarms, Firearms, Shiphandling, Acrobatics,
Artillery, Influence, Lore (navigation), Perception


##### Reputation Increases

Acts of infamous brutality, cunning, devilry or showmanship        +1 to +6

*Most of these modifiers are cumulative. If an Adventurer is both a Master-level Adventurer and
has recently defeated a grave nearby threat, he is entitled to both bonuses. However, he does not
receive the bonuses for being a Seasoned- or Veteran-level character - those are subsumed by the
Master-level bonus.


### Using Reputation
For Reputation to have an impact on an Adventurer's life and dealings with Non-Player
Characters, the Adventurer must make a Reputation test.

For a pirate, Reputation affects the use of the Influence skill and also determines an Adventurer's
sway over his crew. It also has some impact on skills such as Disguise. The Reputation Effects table
gives some general guidelines for bonuses to skills based on the Reputation of the Adventurers.

Whether or not the Adventurer receives a bonus or penalty to his Influence test depends upon
the nature of his Reputation and who he is dealing with.


##### Reputation Effects

41-50               +40% / -40%                               -25%

On board a ship, there are a number of modifiers to an Adventurer's Reputation.

Reputation is especially important for pirate captains, as the sight of a particularly fearsome
pirate flag can convince some prey into surrendering immediately.


##### Reputation Changes
An Adventurer who is out of circulation (marooned on a desert island, on a voyage to the other
side of the world, or living in luxury on some plantation) has his Reputation decrease by 1D6
points per month.

An Adventurer who is believed to be dead or who takes on a new identity can build up a
Reputation for this second identity.

Reputation of...       You are...                                         Reward for your capture
10 or less             Unknown                                            None
11-15                  Known by people in Port Royal or New Providence    None
16-20                  Known by many in the Caribbean                     1,000 silver
21-30                  Known by the Royal Navy                            5,000 silver
31-40                  Infamous                                           25,000 silver
41+                    Known world-wide                                   50,000 silver


## Legendary Abilities
Even historical pirates quickly became legendary figures, their deeds and depravities exaggerated
until they became fearsome monsters. They were said to be fearless, impossible to find when
hiding, impossible to stop when attacking, or even in league with the Devil. In a cinematic or
fantasy game, of course, all that could be true!

Of the Legendary Abilities in the Legend Core Rulebook, several are suitable for use in Pirates of
Legend games.


##### Optional Rule: Reputation and the Great Powers
There are four major powers in the Caribbean - the English, the Spanish, the Dutch and the
French. While all four despise pirates, they may be favourably disposed to those who harm their
enemies and especially hostile to those who act against the Power's interests. This is reflected in a
special modifier to Reputation, called Standing. This modifier applies only when the Adventurer
is in a port or on board a ship loyal to that power. Standing always adds positively to Reputation,
making it more likely that the Adventurer will be recognised but an Adventurer with positive
Standing is well liked and honoured, while negative Standing means that the Adventurer is
considered a criminal.

This adds an extra level of politics and book-keeping to the game, so it should only be included
if the differing agendas of the powers is going to come into the campaign.

                                                           
Character's Action                            Standing With Affected Power   Standing With Other Powers

Abilities marked with a * are to be found in the main Legend Core Rulebook.	
Abilities marked with a ~ are especially suited to a Cinematic campaign.	


##### Heroic Aura and Crew Combat
The bonus to Persistence and Resilience tests from an Adventurer's Heroic Aura applies to a
whole crew. The second part of the Legendary Ability, the power to temporarily increase weapon
skills does not.


Always Something to Swing From	
Requirements: DEX 15+, Acrobatics 90%+	
Hero Points: 8

No matter where you are, there is always a rope, line, chandelier, jungle vine, pulley, inn sign,
flagpole or other thing to swing from. Such dramatic acrobatics can be used to swing past
opponents. You can also swing into combat as a charge, gaining a +5% bonus to hit in addition
to the normal +1D4 bonus to damage.


Born to the Sea	
Requirements: POW 15+, Shiphandling 90%+
Hero Points: 8

When at the helm of a ship, the following effects take place:
•	   Any penalty to your Shiphandling skill is reduced by -20 %. For instance, if the driving
rains and slippery ground would normally apply a -40% penalty to your Shiphandling
test, the penalty is reduced to -20%.
•	   You may increase your ship's movement by +12 feet/1 knot.
•	   Any Seaworthiness losses are reduced by one. For example, if the ship would lose 5
Seaworthiness as the result of a storm, then this loss is reduced to 4.


Contact
Hero Points: 2

Every time you take this Legendary Ability, you gain a trusted friend on one of the islands of the
Caribbean. This friend will shelter you in times of need, pass on rumours and interesting tales to
you, receive stolen goods and so forth.


Dashing	
Requirements: CHA 13+
Hero Points: 4

You are especially stylish and charming. You gain a +20% bonus to Influence tests made against
female Adventurer (female Adventurer may take a variant of this Legendary Ability called
Beautiful, which gives a +20% bonus to Influence tests against male Adventurer).


Devil's Luck
Requirements: POW 15+	
Hero Points: 8

You are cursed or blessed with the devil's own luck. This has two abilities:
•	     Whenever you spend a Hero Point to get a Second Chance, you also get a +10% bonus
  to the re-roll attempt.
•	     When killed, you may put yourself into the Games Master's hands. You will always
  survive but your POW is reduced by 1D6 and you will most likely end up in a very
  dangerous or unpleasant situation.


Drowned Man
Requirements: CON 15+, Athletics 70%
Hero Points: 8

You nearly drowned once and are now almost a thing of the sea. You may hold your breath
for three times longer than normal and the Resilience test to hold your breath after this period
expires does not suffer from a -10% cumulative penalty. Furthermore, any penalties to attacks
and actions under water are reduced by 20%.


Fearsome Aura
Requirements: CHA 15+, any Weapon skill at 70%+
Hero Points: 12

All foes within your CHA in yards will be intimidated by your presence, suffering your CHA as
a penalty to any Persistence or Resilience tests they are called upon to make.

In addition, you may take a Combat Action to terrify your nearby enemies, requiring an
Opposed Influence versus Persistence test. If this is successful, they suffer your CHA as a penalty
to all Weapon skills for the remainder of the Combat Round. This ability only works on the
Adventurer scale, not on the crew scale.


Infamous
Requirements: Reputation 10+	
Hero Points: 2

Stories of your deeds as a pirate have spread far and wide. Increase your Reputation by +5.


Old Salt
Requirements: Shiphandling or Boating 50%+
Hero Points: 2

You are an especially experienced sailor. You may reduce all penalties to the movement of a ship
by 10% and increase all your Crew's skills by 1%.


Pet
Hero Points: 2

You have a pet monkey, parrot, cat, dog or other animal. This animal is smart enough to follow
basic instructions and will follow you around no matter where you go.


Powder Monkey
Requirements: Any Firearms skill at 70%	
Hero Points: 4

You have a knack for using gunpowder. You never suffer misfires when using a firearm.


Quick Reload
Requirements: DEX 15+, any Firearms skill at 70%	
Hero Points: 8

You are especially nimble at reloading weapons. Reduce the reload time for all guns and cannons
you are using by one-third.


Vice
Hero Points: 2

You have developed another Vice (choose from the list in the Vices section), or increased an
existing Vice by one point. You may take this Legendary Ability multiple times.


Vices
'I soon found that any death was preferable to being linked with such a vile crew of miscreants, to
whom it was a sport to do mischief, where prodigious drinking, monstrous cursing and swearing,
hideous blasphemies and open defiance of Heaven, and contempt of Hell itself, was the constant
employment, unless when something abated the noise and revellings.'

- From the account of Philip Ashton, captured by pirates in 1722

A freedom to indulge one's lusts and appetites freely was one of the great attractions of the pirate's
way. On pirate ships, drink flowed freely and there was little to do but laze around (pirate ships
had far more crew than a merchantman of similar size, so the work was divided among many
hands). When a prize was captured, then the pirates would gamble their winnings away. Of
course, more pirates were captured on account of being drunk than any other reason - revels
had their costs.

In game terms, an Adventurer may take up to two points of Vices at the start of a campaign and
can purchase more by taking the Vice Legendary Ability. A Vice is a particularly strong desire
possessed by the Adventurer, one that he must indulge. Vices are rated by points; the more
points, the stronger the Vice.

Vices have two game effects. Firstly, if the Adventurer deliberately indulges his Vice, he gets one
Hero Point. A drunkard who searches for a captured ship's rum locker instead of its strongbox, a
gambler who willingly throws away all his hard-won silver, a seducer who chases the governor's
daughter instead of escaping the town - they all deserve Hero Points as recompense for their
stupidity. An Adventurer can only indulge his Vice once per point per adventure. So, an
Adventurer with two Vice Points in Drunkard could get unnecessarily and inconveniently drunk
twice per adventure and get one Hero Point each time (he could get drunk many more times
during the adventure but only gains a mechanical advantage once per Vice Point).

For example, Fat Pete has three points in, surprisingly, Gluttony. As the Adventurers' ship is sailing
along, Fat Pete's player describes in detail how his Adventurer has hidden his own supply of food in a
barrel and creeps out at night to gorge himself. This Adventurer detail gets the player one Hero Point
and he could get another two Hero Points later in the adventure for being gluttonous in other ways.

Secondly, if the Adventurer has a chance to indulge his Vice at a time when he does not want
to, he must make a Persistence test, penalised by -20% per Vice Point after the first (so, -20%
at two Vice Points, -40% at three points and so forth). If the Persistence test fails, then the
Adventurer gives into temptation.

The Adventurers are trapped on an island by a Royal Navy patrol. Soldiers from the ship have landed on
the shore and made camp for the night; the pirates are hiding in the nearby jungle. All the Adventurers
need to do is wait for the soldiers to fall asleep and they can either sneak away or attack under cover
of darkness. Unfortunately, the soldiers are roasting a wild chicken and Fat Pete's downwind of that
lovely smell. His stomach rumbles incessantly. Fat Pete's player must make a Persistence test at -40%
(Fat Pete's a three-point Glutton). If the Persistence test fails, then Fat Pete can stand the hunger no
more and must try to get hold of that chicken somehow.

Indulgence is chosen by the pirate's player; Temptation is inflicted by the Games Master.

Some Vices (like Honour) work slightly differently; see the individual descriptions.




Vices
Avarice - Gold and jewels
Blasphemy - Offending against God and civility
Bravado - You must be the bravest and most dramatic
Cowardice - You value your life above all else
Cruelty - You delight in torture
Destruction - Blowing things up
Drink - Wine, whiskey or rum
Freedom - You cannot stand to be constrained
Gambling - Dice, cards or whatever comes to hand
Gluttony - Either fine food or lots of food
Honour - You have a code of conduct
Lust - Women of all sorts
Revenge - Against an individual, group or institution
Seduction - The thrill of the chase
Superstition - You fear ghosts and goblins
Piety - You have a deep respect for the divine
Pride - Your reputation means everything to you
Wrath - You long for combat




Avarice
You desire wealth, especially gold. You go out of your way to find treasure and hoard it when you
do. Avaricious Adventurer cannot resist the lure of plunder.
Indulged by: Looting treasure, counting your gold.
Tempted by: Treasure of all sorts, especially gold and jewels.


Blasphemy
You have quarrelled with God and hate Him and all His works. You may be an avowed Atheist,
or believe yourself to be the Devil's own.
Indulged by: Destroying churches, insulting priests, shocking others with your words.
Tempted by: Especially big ways to offend the Almighty or believers.


Bravado
You are the living embodiment of the pirate myth; a devilish, dashing rogue, and you play to
the stereotype.
Indulged by: Witty quips, dramatic entrances.
Tempted by: Showing off to the crowd when fleeing over subtlety would be preferable.


Cowardice
You are a craven rogue, interested only in saving your own skin.
Indulged by: Hanging at the back when it comes to a fight; finding cover; being scared.
Tempted by: Running and fleeing instead of fighting.



Cruelty
You delight in cruelty and torture and are thoroughly black-hearted and vile.
Indulged by: Being cruel; punishing others.
Tempted by: Chances to be unnecessarily cruel to a defeated foe.


Destruction
No doubt you have all manner of gunpowder bombs and incendiaries about your person, for you
love nothing more than fire.
Indulged by: Delighting in blowing things up; setting fire to things; making bombs.
Tempted by: The chance to blow something really big up.



Drink
A powerful thirst
for all manner of
drink is upon you.
Indulged by:
Drinking.
Tempted by:
Drinking.


Wine, Whiskey and Rum
Common drinks in the age of piracy include rum, punch, wine, whiskey and gin. Grog, a drink
associated with pirates in stories, was actually not invented until the 1740s.

An Adventurer who drinks excessively must make a Resilience test, penalised by the strength
of the drink. Especially potent drinks give a -20% or higher penalty. If the Resilience test
is failed, then the Adventurer is drunk. A drunk Adventurer suffers a -10% penalty on all
DEX and INT-based tests but gains a +10% bonus to Resilience and Persistence tests made
to resist harsh conditions like cold or pain, or to resist intimidation. Drunkenness can raise
crew morale. The modifiers from drunkenness do not apply to further Resilience tests to avoid
getting drunker.

An already-drunk Adventurer can become Very Drunk (+/- 20% penalty) or Blind Drunk (+/-
40% penalty).




Freedom
You cannot stand to be constrained.
Indulged by: Refusing to obey any law or accepting any limit on your movement.
Tempted by: Thumbing your nose at society; escaping when you really should stay confined.


Gambling
Be it dice, cards or the flight of gulls, you will wager on anything.
Indulged by: Gambling.
Tempted by: Gambling.


Gluttony
You are always hungry and gorge yourself whenever you can.
Indulged by: Eating, cooking.
Tempted by: Feasting.


Honour
You refuse to break oaths or contravene your own personal beliefs.
Indulged by: Keeping to your own system of honour.
Tempted by: Holding to your own system of honour, even when it will have dire consequences
for you (for example, letting a foe go because you gave your word you would.)


Lust
Your appetite for sexual satisfaction is boundless.
Indulged by: Whoring.
Tempted by: A willing woman.


Revenge
You have a special hatred for a group or individual and go out of your way to defeat or injure
them or their agents.
Indulged by: Slaying agents or foiling the plans of your foe.
Tempted by: Inflicting serious injury on your foe.


Seduction
You delight in seducing women; your pleasure is not in the conquest (although that is pleasant
enough) but in the chase.
Indulged by: Flirtation and seduction.
Tempted by: Inaccessible, haughty or well-born women.


Superstitious
You believe in ghosts, demons and all manner of hostile spirits.
Indulged by: Taking preparations against such horrors; finding relics; observing superstitious
traditions.
Tempted by: Fleeing when confronted by anything that might be supernatural.


Piety
Unlike most pirates, you have a great respect for the Church.
Indulged by: Attending or celebrating mass; abhorring blasphemy.
Tempted by: Confession; protecting a church from being looted.


Wrath
You long for combat in all its forms.
Indulged by: Picking fights.
Tempted by: Picking fights you have little chance of winning.


chattels, blades
and gunshot

While prices for various goods are given in this chapter, much of what a pirate owned would be
taken by force. The gold and silver won from captured ships would be spent in the friendly ports
like Port Royal or New Providence on drink and women.



Currency
Prices are given in reales, silver Spanish coins. Spanish doubloons and pieces of eight are more
commonly used by pirates. Doubloons are gold coins; silver pieces of eight are worth a quarter
of a doubloon, or eight reales.

1 Doubloon = 4 pieces of eight = 32 reales

Adventurers may also encounter English crowns, shillings and pence, or Dutch ducats, daalders
and florins.




Melee Weapons
Belaying Pin: Belaying pins are iron spikes used to secure ropes on board a ship but they also
make excellent improvised weapons. An Adventurer using a belaying pin suffers a -10% penalty
to hit.

Boarding Axe: Boarding axes are used to cut lines and as a support when climbing, as well as a
weapon. An Adventurer using a boarding axe gets a +10% bonus to Athletics checks to climbing
wooden surfaces.

Boarding Pike: Boarding pikes are cheap spears with a hooked end. An Adventurer using a
boarding pike gets a +10% bonus to Athletics tests when making boarding actions.

Buckler: This duelling shield is the only shield still in common use in the age of piracy.

Cat o'nine tails: A heavy, nine-tongued whip used as a punishment device.

Club: Or a tree branch, bar stool, piece of timber, crowbar...

Cutlass: A cutlass is a heavy curved sword, short enough to be used on board a ship without
getting tangled in the ever-present ropes and lines but sharp and strong enough to cut through a
foe. Cutlasses are used by navies the world over. Its basket hilt gives a +10% bonus to Parry tests.

Dagger: A long knife, balanced for throwing.

Dirk: Slightly larger and more damaging than a dagger, dirks suffer a -10% penalty to Parry
attempts.

Halberd: Polearms like this are common weapons for guards and soldiers in forts.

Hatchet: Mainly used for hewing wood or cutting through jungle but still a lethal weapon.

Knife: A simple knife.

Quarterstaff: Rarely used as a weapon but still easy to make and obtain.

Rapier: A duelling rapier. Weapons like this are often of exceptional quality.

Scimitar: A wickedly curved sword, more common in Moslem lands than in the west. The
infamous Barbary pirates may use such blades.

Spear: From weapons used by wild natives to improved spears.

Shortsword: Commonly used in combination with another blade by a duellist.

Tomahawk: Adapted from the Native American weapon of the same name, a tomahawk is a
small, well-balanced axe that can be thrown.

Whip: A length of leather more commonly used to goad slaves than as a weapon.




Whips
Whips can be used in three different ways:
•	 As a direct attack on any foe within 10 feet (2 metres). A whip cannot be used on an
adjacent target. Such attacks use the normal rules.
•	 As a grapple attack on any foe within 10 feet (2 metres). If the grapple attack succeeds,
then the attacker may immediately make a Throw or Incapacitate attack but the two are not
considered to be grappling. If the defender is allowed Riposte and the whip wielder is out of
range, then the defender may instead choose to try to wrench the whip out of the attacker's
hand (use an opposed Athletics (Brute Force) test to determine who wins).
•	 As a short rope, for swinging off masts and grabbing onto railings. In certain situations, the
Whip skill can be substituted for the Acrobatics skill.




Gunpowder
Gunpowder is carried in either a powder horn or in prepared paper packets. It must be loaded
into the gun along with wadding and shot.

On a 00 (fumble), then the gun has misfired and must be loaded from scratch. On a 96-99, then
the gun has simply failed to fire.

If a gun is not properly maintained, then the gun's chance to misfire or fail increases. This can
also happen with improperly stored power.

If powder gets wet, then the misfire chance doubles at the very least, and may increase further.
Soaked powder is almost certain not to function.

Gunpowder Explosions
Gunpowder fuses can be made using the Artillery skill, or just improved by making an INT+DEX
test. A powder horn will explode for 2D4 damage, or an improvised bomb for 1D4 x 1D4
damage. A barrel of gunpowder deals 6D6 damage if it explodes.

1 - This weapon will impale an opponent upon a critical hit.  
2 - This weapon suffers no penalty when used in close combat.  
3 - Parrying with a firearm can damage the internal mechanisms - the weapon counts as being poorly maintained if used to parry an attack.  
4 - Parrying with a grenade is pretty much the definition of 'a really bad idea'.


Blunderbuss: Blunderbuss weapons fire a hail of shot, or can even be loaded with scrap and
nails. They are rather inaccurate but devastating at close range. Blunderbusses suffer a -20%
penalty to hit at long range but do an extra 1D6 damage at short range.

Grenade: Grenades are bottles or iron casks filled with powder and metal, which explode
violently. They are commonly used in boarding actions, scattering an enemy crew before the
pirates attack.

Musket: Muskets fire a heavy lead ball. They are the commonest firearm in this era.

Pistol: Pistols are smaller versions of muskets. Most pirates have at least a pair of pistols and
some carry four or five, so they can keep firing without needing to stop and reload.

Pistol, Blunderbuss: A blunderbuss pistol is a wide mouthed gun that works just like its larger
cousin. It suffers a -20% penalty to hit at long range but does an extra 1D4 damage at close
range.

Pistol, Pocket: Pocket pistols are small enough to be concealed and are generally seen as a
coward's gun or a hold-out weapon. An Adventurer can hide a pocket pistol inside a pocket or
secret compartment.

Rifle: Rifles are a new form of musket; grooves are carved into the inner surface of the barrel,
making the shot spin when fired, resulting in a more accurate attack. Effectively, a rifle is an
Exceptional-quality musket, effect giving a +10% bonus to hit.

Armour & Clothing
Armour is used sparingly in this era, as most firearms are powerful enough to punch through the
heavy plate and chain of previous centuries.

Duellists Half-Cape: This is a length of flexible cloth that is often cut into a draped cape of sorts
that hangs over the chest and unused arm during a swordfight. A number of stiff leather strips
are sewn into the cape here and there, giving additional protection to the areas they cover. The
half-cape's construction allows it to be twirled over one arm or the other as a Combat Reaction.
This adds the cape's Armour Points to the covered arm if desired. Also, if taken from around the
chest and held in one hand, the half-cape can be used like a buckler - offering no AP protection
but allowing a +10% bonus to Parry skill tests.

Buff Coat: A heavy jacket, commonly worn by sailors.

Pitch Jacket: A linen shirt or jacket, covered with hardened pitch. Easy to improvise on board
a ship.

Breastplate: Some soldiers wear still metal breastplates as a defence against enemy blades.

Clothes Maketh The Man
When dealing with the aristocracy and the authorities, fine clothes are a requirement. An
Adventurer suffers a modifier to all Courtesy and Influence tests depending on his dress in any
encounter with wealthy, respectable types in civilised surroundings (obviously, Influence works
very differently if the wealthy gent with his fine powdered wig is kneeling on the deck with a
cutlass at his throat).

# Crews and Sworn Companions

A pirate crew is a brotherhood of rogues, united by a common desire for plunder. They are
not a disciplined military unit, nor do they give false respect to lords and rich men. There is
no authority among them save the authority they give their leaders. A pirate crew is more of
a democracy, where each man has his say. Important decisions are made by a vote of all the
pirates; the captain really has authority only in battle. Just as important as the captain is the
quartermaster, who represents the crew's needs to the captain, leads boarding actions and settles
disputes. Officers are also elected to command parts of the crew in battle; most crews will have a
gunner, a boatswain, a carpenter, a cook and a mate or two.

Of course, the size of a crew varies wildly. A small ship like a sloop might have only a dozen
pirates aboard but a mighty galleon would be crewed by hundreds of rogues - and a pirate
ship that big is no doubt accompanied by a consort vessel or three, making her captain a pirate
admiral.


Crew Quality
In Pirates of Legend, the quality of a crew counts for much. An experienced gang of dangerous
pirates will obviously outfight or out sail a few green merchant seamen but would still turn tail
and run when confronted by the best ship in the Royal Navy.

Crew qualities range from Atrocious to Peerless. Each crew quality has a percentile value
associated with it, which is the crew's basic skill level. This is the average skill level of the crew
when it comes to making a Skill Test for the whole ship. Individual sailors may have a skill that is
far higher or lower than this average but crew Skill Tests are made for a whole crew.

Crew Quality                                                         Base Skill
Atrocious (Landlubbers)                                              15%
Very Poor (Green)                                                    25%
Poor (Scurvy Dogs)                                                   40%
Average (Passing Fair)                                               50%
Good (Sea Dogs)                                                      60%
Excellent (Devilish Cut-throats)                                     75%
Fearsome (Most Notorious Pirates)                                    100%
Peerless (Devils Straight From Hell)                                 150%


While this base skill can be used for any Skill Test made by the crew, a few skills are obviously
much more important for a piratical band. Skills like Shiphandling, Boating, Gunnery or throat-
cutting are of more use to a pirate crew than being able to dance or speak prettily. Having a good
quartermaster leading a ship's boarding party or a canny gunner in charge of the powder kegs
can make all the difference in a battle. Therefore, a crew gets bonuses from having skilled officers
in positions of authority.




Choice Men and Reduced Crews
A crew's quality is the average of the pirates' skills. Now, some lazy sod or clumsy fool will drag
that average down, just as an especially hardy sailor or iron-nerved cannoneer will bring the total
up. In a given crew, then, it is possible to pick the best men and come up with a smaller crew of
a higher average skill. On average, 10% of a crew will be one quality rank higher and 10% will
be one quality rank lower. So, for a Poor crew, 10% will be Very Poor and 10% will be Average.

It is possible, obviously, to improve a crew by taking the best sailors from other crews and getting
rid of your own unskilled dogs. Pirates often raid the hardy crews of the Newfoundland fishing
boats for new recruits.

1 - The Quartermaster may choose any one melee weapon to determine the bonus he gives the crew.  
2 - The Gunner may choose either his Pistols or Longarms skill to determine the bonus he gives
the crew.

The crew skill gets a bonus equal to one-tenth the skill total of the appropriate officer. For
example, if a Gunner has a Gunnery skill of 70%, then the crew gets a bonus of +7% to all Gunnery
crew checks. A Poor crew has a base skill of 40%, plus 7% for the leadership provided by their good
gunner, so they would have an effective Gunnery of 47%.


Pirate Flags
While the skull-and-crossbones is the traditional pirate flag, it was not the only flag used. Every
captain had his own unique flag, a barbaric coat of arms that everyone will recognise. Pirate flags
used a combination of symbols of death, like skulls, hourglasses, bloody swords and so on. A
newly elected captain should choose the flag he will sail under.




Crew Skill Tests
A crew Skill Test is made whenever the whole crew must act as one. They work in exactly the
same way as a normal Skill Test - roll percentile dice and try to get under the crew's skill total.
For example, when firing a broadside of cannons, then the crew must make a Gunnery test.

The Games Master makes all crew tests for opposing crews.

For Adventurer ships, if one of the Adventurers is an officer, then he may make crew tests for
those skills in his officer's purview. If not, then any player may make the test.

Crew Skill Tests and Hero Points: Hero Points can be spent to re-roll crew tests but it costs
three Hero Points to re-roll such a test, not just one. Several Adventurers can join together to pay
this Hero Point cost for a re-roll.


Morale
The other major factor in a crew is morale - how much stomach they have for a fight and how
much belief they have in their captain and the course he has set. Morale is bolstered by victories
and plunder, and sapped by defeat, dullness or adversity. Morale tests must often be made in
battle.

Morale is rated in levels. A Crew's morale can be Fanatic, Very High, High, Average, Shaken,
Low or Mutinous.

Morale is calculated at the start of a voyage, as follows:

Crew Quality                                   Base Morale
Atrocious                                      Low
Very Poor                                      Shaken
Poor                                           Shaken
Average                                        Average
Good                                           Average
Excellent                                      High
Fearsome                                       High
Peerless                                       Very High

Add the following factors to that base morale:
•	    If the captain has a Charisma of 15 or higher, increase the crew's morale by one level.
•	    If the cook has a Cooking skill of 50% or higher, increase the crew's morale by one level.
•	    If the musician has a Perform skill of 50% or higher, increase the crew's morale by one
 level.

Morale is also recalculated if the captain is replaced.

Morale will rise and fall very quickly during voyages. See Piracy, page 63, for more details on
events at sea.


Morale Tests
Certain situations will call for a Morale test, which is made using the Crew's Persistence score. If
this test is failed, then the crew's nerve has faltered and they lose one level of Morale. On a critical
success, the crew is galvanised by the challenge and gains one level of Morale.

The Games Master makes all Morale tests.

Hero Points may be spent to re-roll Morale tests - it costs the Adventurers three Hero Points to
get such a re-roll.


Morale Bonuses
A crew gets a bonus to all Crew Tests based on its morale. This morale bonus can be a very useful
edge in a fight between evenly matched crews.

Morale                                        Modifier to Crew Tests
Mutinous                                      -10%
Low                                           -5%
Shaken                                        +0%
Average                                       +0%
High                                          +0%
Very High                                     +5%
Fanatic                                       +10%


Elections
An Adventurer's Reputation determines how much influence he has on board ship. Most
ordinary deck-hands will just follow the Adventurer with the highest Reputation, or who has
won their trust. In any contest of influence on board ship, follow this procedure:

Step One
Start by determining who the contenders are. For example, if there are two Adventurers on
board who hope to be quartermaster, then these two are the contenders. If the Adventurers are
trying to convince the crew that the captain should be removed, then the captain and one of the
Adventurers are the contenders.

Next, the positions of the rest of the crew must be considered.

Step Two
Remove from consideration all members of the crew whose Reputation is less than half that of
the highest Reputation on board ship. Effectively, this will remove all but the officers and other
highly influential pirates on board. For example, if the captain has Reputation 16, then anyone
with a Reputation of less than eight is simply irrelevant in terms of sway.



Going On The Account
To 'go on the account' means to become a pirate and join a pirate crew. The majority of pirates
joined such crews voluntarily, hoping for little work but rich rewards, or they were running from
something and had nowhere else to go. One may as well be hung for being a pirate as for being
a murderer or a thief. Others were press-ganged into joining a pirate crew; when the merchant
ship you serve on is taken as a prize and the choice is between joining the rogues and a knife in
the gut, only the most principled man would not join the pirates.

Every pirate crew has its own articles that every man among them must sign to. One famous set
of articles, used by the crew of Captain Roberts, ran as follows:

ARTICLE I. Every man shall have an equal vote in affairs of moment. He shall have an equal
title to the fresh provisions or strong liquors at any time seized and shall use them at pleasure
unless a scarcity may make it necessary for the common good that a retrenchment may be voted.

ARTICLE II. Every man shall be called fairly in turn by the list on board of prizes, because over
and above their proper share, they are allowed a shift of clothes. But if they defraud the company
to the value of even one dollar in plate, jewels or money, they shall be marooned. If any man robs
another he shall have his nose and ears slit and be put ashore where he shall be sure to encounter
hardships.

ARTICLE III. None shall game for money either with dice or cards.

ARTICLE IV. The lights and candles should be put out at eight at night and if any of the crew
desire to drink after that hour they shall sit upon the open deck without lights.

ARTICLE V. Each man shall keep his piece, cutlass and pistols at all times clean and ready for
action.

ARTICLE VI. No boy or woman to be allowed amongst them. If any man shall be found
seducing any of the latter sex and carrying her to sea in disguise he shall suffer death.

ARTICLE VII. He that shall desert the ship or his quarters in time of battle shall be punished
by death or marooning.

ARTICLE VIII. None shall strike another on board the ship but every man's quarrel shall
be ended on shore by sword or pistol in this manner. At the word of command from the
quartermaster, each man being previously placed back to back, shall turn and fire immediately.
If any man does not, the quartermaster shall knock the piece out of his hand. If both miss their
aim they shall take to their cutlasses, and he that draweth first blood shall be declared the victor.

ARTICLE IX. No man shall talk of breaking up their way of living till each has a share of £l,000.
Every man who shall become a cripple or lose a limb in the service shall have 800 pieces of eight
from the common stock and for lesser hurts proportionately.

ARTICLE X. The captain and the quartermaster shall each receive two shares of a prize, the
master gunner and boatswain, one and one half shares, all other officers one and one quarter, and
private gentlemen of fortune one share each.

ARTICLE XI. The musicians shall have rest on the Sabbath Day only by right. On all other
days by favour only.

Every pirate ship will have its own articles, agreed upon and kept to by the crew.


Step Three
Of those crewmen remaining after step two, determine who each of them supports. Add half
their Reputation scores, rounding down, to the Reputation score of the contender they support.
This total score is referred to as an Adventurer's Sway in the election.

Step Four
Finally, each contender rolls 1D10 and adds it to their score. The contender with the highest
score wins the contest. In certain circumstances, a dramatic speech or other act to inspire loyalty,
like bribery, can give the Adventurer a further bonus to Sway.



Captain of Shreds and Patches
The pirate ship Greywater has gone to the bottom, along with most of her crew. However, 12
pirates managed to escape on board a battered boat and now they are arguing amongst themselves
over who is in charge. Their Reputation scores are important for this contest, so here they are:

Pirate                                              Reputation
Pete the Scoundrel                                  8
One-Eyed Joe                                        6
Mart Roberts                                        6
Alan Fairhands                                      5
French Lou                                          5
Rest of the pirates                                 0-3

Pete the Scoundrel, a notorious murderer, and One-Eyed Joe are both in contention to be
captain. As Pete has Reputation 8, anyone with Reputation 4 or less is irrelevant.

Next, it must be determined who the other pirates will support. While Pete is well known as a
killer, few of the others trust him; therefore, Mart Roberts and French Lou support One-Eyed
Joe, adding half their Reputation score to his. Alan Fairhands supports his old friend Pete.

Pete now has a total Sway of 8+2 = 10. One-Eyed Joe has a total score of 6+3+2 = 11.

Finally, both Adventurers roll 1D10, and with the crew on a knife-edge like that, blind luck will
make all the difference. One-Eyed Joe wins, and is elected Captain.

Pete the Scoundrel smiles, and fingers his wickedly sharp knife. One-Eyed Joe, is it? Well, Joe,
what you don't see on your left side can still hurt you...




Some positions give a temporary Reputation bonus. This bonus is applied immediately.


Captains, Quartermasters and Officers
Holding a position of authority on board a ship gives an Adventurer more responsibilities and
often puts him in a perilous situation but does also give him more influence among the crew
and a greater share of the prize. Every pirate vessel will have a captain and a quartermaster at the
very least. If a ship has guns, then it must have a master gunner; if it has boats, it must have a
boatswain.


Each officer's position gives extra shares of booty. It may also give a temporary bonus to
Reputation, if the Adventurer fulfils certain requirements. If these requirements are not met,
then the bonus becomes a penalty - a good cook wins the crew's love but a bad cook causes
grumbling and dissent.

An officer also gives a bonus to certain crew skill tests, equal to one-fifth the officer's skill in that
category.

Captain: Commands the ship in battle; orders its course; leads the crew (note that becoming a
captain gives a permanent +4 bonus to Reputation as well as a temporary one - see the Reputation
table on page 92). The captain gives a bonus to the crew's Shiphandling, Persistence and Morale.

Quartermaster: Resolves disputes, shares out plunder, leads boarding actions. The quartermaster
gives a bonus to all Hand to Hand attacks and to Resilience.

Boatswain: Commands the ship's boats; second in command in boarding actions. The boatswain
gives a bonus to Boating.

Gunner: Commands the ship's guns; keeps the armoury. The gunner gives a bonus to Gunnery
and Firearms.

Cook: Commands the ship's stores. Gives a bonus to Morale.

Carpenter's Mate: Commands repairs and supplies. Gives a bonus to Craft (Carpentry) used
when repairing a ship.




Captain of Shreds & Patches, Part II.
To return to those unfortunates on that doomed little boat ...

The 12 survivors of the Greywater are a poor crew but a crew nonetheless, so they shall serve as
an example both of the rules for crews and of the folly of evil men. Their Crew Quality is Poor,
so they have a Base Crew Skill of 40%.

One-Eyed Joe is their Captain; they elect Mart Roberts as Quartermaster and Alan Fairhands as
Boatswain. Without cannons, there is no need for a Gunner and none of them have the skills to
take on any other office.

Doctor: Sews up wounds and saws off limbs. Gives a bonus to the rate at which a crew heals
wounds.

Master: Guides the ship from port to port. Gives a bonus to Navigation.

Musician: Entertains the crew, and adds to Morale. Perform is also used when vapouring to
intimidate enemy crews.

First Mate: Present only on large ships (100 crew or more); helps command the crew. Gives a
bonus to any one skill.

Second Mate: Present only on very large ships (200 crew or more); helps command the crew.
Gives a bonus to any one skill.

Improvement
Crews gain Improvement rolls just like Adventurers but a crew gains Improvement rolls
more rarely - on average, a crew gets one roll per story. Crews use Improvement rolls just like
Adventurers to improve their skills.

A crew Improvement roll may also be spent to increase Morale by one level.


Mutinies
If a crew's Morale is reduced to Mutinous, then they are prepared to turn on their captain. Roll
1D6 on the following list to determine the crew's reaction:

1. Demand an election.
2. The highest reputation officer challenges the captain to a duel. If no-one dares challenge him,
roll again.
3. A conspiracy of officers overthrows the captain and chooses one of their own to lead.
4. Wait until another ship is captured, then take that as their own ship.
5. The crew quarrel among themselves, leading to bloody slaughter on the deck.
6. Strand the captain on an island or boat, and hold an election.


Especially intimidating captains can fend off a mutiny for some time. When a crew chooses to
mutiny, roll against the captain's Reputation. If the result is lower, then the crew are too scared to
rebel for the moment and will defer their mutiny under the next opportunity, giving the captain
a chance to rebuild morale.


Raising Morale
There are several ways to raise morale:
•	     Taking a prize: If the pirates capture a ship without significant losses, they gain one level
  of Morale.
•	     Taking a rich prize: Capturing a ship with a Treasure or Rich Cargo on board also gives
  one level of Morale.
•	     Getting drunk: Allowing a crew to get properly drunk, or spending time at a port, gives
  1D3 levels of morale. A drunken crew suffers a penalty to all Crew tests.



Battle Stations
In a battle, there are three main tasks - sailing the ship, manning the guns and actually fighting
with musket or cutlass. These three crews are handled separately in a battle - see page 63 for
more details on crews in battles.




Healing Damage To A Crew
Each week, the crew should make a Resilience test to see how many of the crew are restored to
health.

Crew Was...                            Failed Test                   Successful Test
Wounded                                50%                           100%
Seriously Wounded                      25%                           50%
Mauled                                 10%                           25%
Slaughtered                            0%                            10%

Having a doctor on board ship gives a +20% bonus to the Resilience test.


Recompense For Damage
Each pirate who is injured permanently (i.e. suffers a Major Wound) may claim recompense
from the common stores. The amount payable to the crippled man depends on the wound he
suffered in action:

Injury                              Compensation
Right Arm Lost                      600 pieces of eight (4,800 silver)
Left Arm Lost                       500 pieces of eight (4,000 silver)
Right Leg Lost                      500 pieces of eight (4,000 silver)
Left Leg Lost                       400 pieces of eight (3,200 silver)
Eye or Finger Lost                  100 pieces of eight (800 silver)

# Ships and the Sea

In the Golden Age of Piracy, the largest ships belong to the navies of the great powers, like
England, France and Spain. These warships are rated by the number of guns. Mighty First-Rate
vessels are more like fortresses than ships and are never seen in the Caribbean. Second- and Third-
Rates are almost as rare and even a Fourth-Rate vessel is more than a match for any pirate vessel.
Most Naval pirate hunting is done by smaller ships, called frigates. Such ships carry around 20 or
30 cannons and around 100 souls on board.

Frigates barely count as Ships of the Line and are used mainly as couriers and scouts in wartime.
Corvettes are even smaller than frigates and are used as escorts and scouts too.

Pirates tend to sail in armed merchant ships. Sloops are fast and tough, able to take full advantage
of the wind with sails mounted from both the mast and bowsprit. Schooners tend to be a little
larger than sloops but have a lesser draft and two masts. As they are able to enter shallower
waters, they are especially favoured by smugglers. Finally, brigantines are two-masted ships that
often carry oars as well as sails; the design was originally so favoured by thieves that the very name
means 'brigand's ship'. Towards the end of the Age of Piracy, the word came to refer mainly to
a style of rigging. Barques are three-masted ships, capable of longer voyages than other vessels.

While both pirates and merchants use sloops, schooners and brigantines, there are other designs
of ship that no sensible pirate would use if he could avoid it. Indiamen are huge cargo vessels,
the backbone of trade between the West Indies and Europe. Snows are another type of trader,
popular in the North Atlantic. Fluyts are another common design.

Spanish galleons are a rare sight in this era but there are still treasure ships bringing the wealth
of the South American mines back to Spain. There are also innumerable smaller vessels on the
seas, from canoes and rowboats and ship's boats (also called pinnaces) to fishing boats and barges.

The ships described here are average models but there was a wide variation between different
types of ship. The defining quality of a ship was often not its size but its rigging and hull design.
A ship can be up to 50% bigger or smaller than the averages listed, with a commensurate change
in Structural Points and guns.


Ship Statistics
Length: The distance from bow to stern.

Draft: The depth of water needed for the ship to manoeuvre effectively and avoid running
aground. This is the distance between the ship's keel and the waterline.


Your Starting Ship
It is assumed that most pirate games will begin with the Adventurers being part of the crew of
a sloop - the smallest vessel commonly used by pirates. Roll on the Ship Traits table for more
details of the sloop.

Capacity: This indicates the cargo capacity of the ship in tons. This number reflects the ship's
cargo capacity in addition to the weight of the ship's rigging, crew, provisions and so forth.
Speed: For rowed vessels, then this lists the speed at which the vessel travels per Crew Combat
Round (30 seconds, or six normal rounds) or per 12 hour period. For sailed vessels, then a
modifier is listed, describing how much faster or slower than average the vessel goes.

Seaworthiness: The ability of the ship to stand up to the rigours of sailing. All ships must
undergo frequent maintenance in order to keep their Seaworthiness rating from deteriorating.

Structure Points: Essentially, Structure Points are a ship's Hit Points. Damage to these represents
damage to the integrity of the ship itself and ships do not heal of their own accord.

Weapons: The weapons carried on the ship.

Crew: The first number is the minimum needed to sail the ship without penalty. The second
number is the average crew on board such a ship and the last number is the maximum number
of people that the ship can reasonably carry.

A vessel can be sailed with as little as one-third the minimum crew - this is called a skeleton
crew. More commonly, a captured vessel is given a two-thirds minimum crew, called a prize crew.

Skill: Every ship has its own peculiarities and each design presents different challenges. This
entry firstly denotes which skill is used when operating the ship (nearly always either Boating
or Shiphandling). Also, though any ship can be operated under ideal conditions without the
necessity of a Skill Test, when the ship and crew are called upon for more extreme endeavours,
this modifier is applied to the Skill Test. Note that this modifier is in addition to any others the
Games Master feels are appropriate.


Overloading
If a ship is carrying more than three-quarters of its maximum cargo capacity, then its draft
increases by 25% and it suffers a -10% penalty to Shiphandling tests.


Crew Size & Crew Tests
A skeleton crew suffers a -20% penalty to all Shiphandling and other crew tests.

A prize crew suffers a -10% penalty to all Shiphandling and other crew tests.

An over-crewed ship gets a +10% bonus to all Shiphandling and other appropriate crew tests.




Changes from the Legend Ship Rules
The ship rules in Pirates of Legend are based on those in the Legend Core Rulebook but have a few key
differences to reflect different priorities and the different settings. Legend assumes a fantasy-medieval
setting, with ships that are quite different from the sloops and schooners of the Spanish Main.
•	 Measurements are in Imperial, not Metric: Having pirates measure speed in kilometres
 instead of knots, or talk about a ship being so many metres long just seems wrong, so
 imperial measurements are used. ('Avast, ye dogs, and fire the 16-kilo cannons!')
•	 Speed works slightly differently: There is a bigger emphasis on sailing speed and wind in
 Pirates of Legend, so a sailed ship's speed is measured as a bonus or penalty.

Ship Qualities: Optional Rule
To add character to a ship, qualities can be used. These are quirks of a ship's design that improve
or hinder its performance. It is impossible to add or remove a quality from a ship; they are simply
part of the way it is.

Each vessel capable of movement by rowing or poling has a Speed entry in its description. This is
the ship's base Movement in normal operating conditions. Rowing a vessel at this normal speed
counts as medium activity for determining Fatigue.

The vessel can be slowed to half speed, which counts only as light activity for the rowers to
maintain. The speed of the vessel can also be doubled, a gruelling activity that counts as heavy
activity for the rowers.

If the vessel is operating against a fresh gale or heavier wind, the level of activity is increased by
one step. Thus moving at half speed counts as medium activity, moving at normal speed counts
as heavy activity and the vessel cannot move at double speed.

That said, if the vessel is operating before a fresh gale or heavier wind, the level of activity is
decreased by one step. Thus moving at normal speed counts as light activity and moving at
double speed counts as medium activity.


Wind Speed: The speed of the prevailing winds.

Against: The vessel is moving against or perpendicular to the direction of the wind.

Before: The vessel is moving with the prevailing winds.

Skill Modifier: The modifier to the Boating skill imposed by the winds. This modifier is in
addition to the modifiers of the ship itself and any others the Games Master feels are appropriate.

* Rowing vessels cannot make headway in a hurricane.



Sailing
Sails offer some significant advantages over rowing. A sailing ship requires a much smaller crew,
for example, and the ship relies on wind, rather than broad backs, for its propulsion.

The speed of a sailing ship depends upon the angle of the wind in relation to the ship, as well
as the speed of the wind itself. For the sake of simplicity, these rules incorporate four wind
directions: before the wind, quarter wind, half wind and head wind.

Before the Wind: The wind is coming directly from the stern of the ship toward the bow.

Quarter Wind: The wind is blowing against one of the ship's rear quarters, at a roughly 45
degree angle to the length of the ship.

Half Wind: The wind is blowing across the ship, at a roughly 90 degree angle to the length of
the ship.

Head Wind: The wind is blowing directly from the bow of the ship toward the stern.

The Sailing Speed table gives the speed a sailing ship will travel under different wind speeds,
presented in the following manner: Speed per Crew Combat Round / Speed per 12 hour period.


##### Sailing Speed

Wind Speed      Before the Wind    Quarter Wind        Half Wind           Head Wind          Skill Modifier

*The winds of a full gale or a hurricane will shred a ship's rigging. In such a situation, the best
that can be done is to deploy a small amount of sailcloth to keep the ship steady and hope to ride
out the storm. Alternatively, the truly reckless or desperate may press onward, at the same speed
as a fresh gale but with double the normal skill penalty.

The rules assume all sailing ships travel at roughly the same speed, the heavier ships using more
sails to offset their weight. In the event of one ship chasing another, the outcome of the race will
depend upon the Boating or Shiphandling skills of the captains of either ship, and on the ship's
design and rigging.


Sail Modifiers
With a successful Shiphandling test, a crew can change the sails currently deployed by a ship.
Different configurations of sail give different results:

Sail            Speed Modifier        Other Effects
None            No movement           None
Minimum         -25 ft.               None
Fighting        -10 ft.               +10% to Shiphandling tests for manoeuvring
Plain           No modifier           None
Full            +10 ft.               -10% to Shiphandling tests for manoeuvring
Extra           +25 ft.               -20% to Shiphandling tests for manoeuvring


Weapons
There are several sizes of cannon used on board ships. There are also swivel guns, which are
smaller pieces mounted on the deck of a ship, and are used to blast smaller boats or for precise
shooting.

Reloading Cannons: The time it takes to reload a cannon depends on the operator's Gunnery skill.
                              
Gunnery Skill   Combat Actions to reload (Adventurer scale)   Number of Crew Combat rounds to reload (Crew Combat scale)

Buying a Ship
Large ships are rarely for sale - virtually every pirate ship was stolen, or became a pirate ship when
the crew decided to go on the account. Still, especially wealthy pirates may wish to purchase a
vessel, or to sell a prize. In the extremely unlikely event that an Adventurer finds a buyer or seller,
the following prices should be used as guidelines:

Vessel                                   Cost
Rowboat                                  50-200 silver
Sloop                                    5,000-25,000 silver
Schooner                                 50,000-250,000 silver
Brigantine                               100,000-1,00,000 silver



Customising and Changing a Ship
Ships can also be modified to serve other purposes or to emphasise a particular quality. Some
modifications require the ship to be in a port or dock, or hauled up onto a beach.


Modifications
Some of these changes require the ship to be beached or docked but others can be undertaken at
sea, albeit with a penalty to Handiwork of -20%. Particularly difficult tasks also incur a bigger
penalty to the crew's Handiwork test. Each modification also consumes a certain amount of
supplies.

If the Handiwork test fails, then the modification has gone wrong - either the task is impossible,
or else an accident has occurred, smashing whatever items are being used and injuring 1D6 crew.

Aft Guns
This adds a cannon to the rear of the ship, which can be fired when the vessel is being pursued.
Requires: Whatever guns are being added, 1D4 days.
Consumes: 1 ton of supplies per gun
Handiwork Modifier: Varies
The difficulty of the Handiwork test varies depending on the size of the gun and how many aft
guns the ship already has.

9-pounder                                          -0%
Swivel gun                                         -0%
18-pounder                                         -10%
24-pounder                                         -25%
45-pounder                                         -50%
Per gun after the first                            -50%

Bulwarks
Heavy wooden bulwarks and defensive fortifications can be added to a ship's deck, to give extra
protection against attack by muskets and small arms fire. Adding Bulwarks gives a -10% penalty
to all Shiphandling tests. A ship with Bulwarks counts as having a +2 Hull for the purposes of
protecting the crew against small arms fire.
Requires: 1D6 weeks
Consumes: 1 ton of supplies per ten feet length of the ship
Handiwork Modifier: +0%

Copper Bottom
In the warm waters of the Caribbean, a ship can quickly become fouled with teredo beetles,
barnacles, weeds and other growths and parasites that slow its speed. Adding copper plates to the
underwater sections of the hull prevents the needs for careering.
Requires: Drydock, 3D6 weeks
Consumes: Copper plates, costing 100 silver per ton of capacity of the ship
Handiwork Modifier: +0%


Chase Guns
Adding chase guns, on the front of the ship, works just like adding aft guns, with one important
difference - the narrow prow of the ship has less space for extra armament, so the penalty to
Handiwork tests is increased by +20%.

Full Repairs
Full repairs restores 2D6 Structural Points or 1D6 points of Seaworthiness per ton of supplies used.
Requires: 1 day
Consumes: Up to five tons of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: +0%

Hidden Cargo Space
This modification creates a hidden compartment in the ship's hold, where cargo can be hidden.
It is often used by smugglers. Finding such a hidden space requires a Perception test opposed by
the builder's Handiwork.
Requires: 1D6 days
Consumes: One ton of supplies per ton of hiding space.
Handiwork Modifier: -20% if done at sea

Lighten Hull
By removing two cannon, 10% of the ship's cargo space, or by reducing Structural Points by 5%,
the crew make the ship lighter, reducing its draft by one foot and increasing its speed by 6ft/1
knot. This modification can be attempted multiple times but each time, the Handiwork test
penalty doubles. This modification cannot be attempted if it would reduce the ship's draft to 0.
Requires: 1D6 days
Consumes: 1D6 tones of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: -10%

More Cannon
Adding more cannons to a ship can be done but there are two major restrictions. Firstly, heavy cannon
will slow the ship down. Secondly, the extra recoil may damage the ship, or even cause it to capsize.

For every eight 9-pounders, four 18-pounders, two 24-pounders or single 45-pounder added,
then reduce the ship's Movement by 3 ft/ 1/2 knot.

If the guns mounted are larger than normal, then a second Handiwork test must be made the
first time the guns are fired. If this test fails, then the gun breaks free of its housing and deals 2D6
points of Structural Damage to the ship. The ship also loses 1D4 Seaworthiness.

Requires: Extra cannon, 1D4 days
Consumes: 1 ton of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: Varies


9-pounder                                                             -0%
18-pounder                                                            -5%
24-pounder                                                            -10%
45-pounder                                                            -25%
Per gun after the first                                               -20%
If guns are larger than those commonly mounted on this ship           -10% per size difference


More Cargo Space
By removing internal frames and cabin space, the crew allow the ship to cram in more cargo. The
ship's Structure Points are decreased by 5% to increase its capacity by an equal amount. A ship
can add no more than 25% to its starting capacity.
Requires: One day.
Consumes: 1 ton of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: -10%

More Sail
By adding more spars or even an extra mast, the crew attempt to increase the base speed of the
vessel. The capacity of the ship is reduced by 10% or it suffers a -10% penalty to all Shiphandling
tests but its speed is increased by 6 ft/1 knot.
Requires: 1D6 days.
Consumes: 2D6 tons of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: -10%

Reinforced Hull
By fortifying the ship for combat, even a merchant vessel can be made into a warship. The ship's
Hull rating is increased by 1 and its Structure Point total is increased by 20%.
Requires: 3D6 weeks.
Consumes: One ton of supplies per five Structure Points.
Handiwork Modifier: -10%


Temporary Measures
Bail Out The Bilges
A crew can temporarily raise the Seaworthiness of a ship by 1D4 points by frantically fixing leaks
and bailing out floodwaters. This must be repeated every day to keep the bonus points in place.
Requires: 8 hours
Consumes: 1D6 tons of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: -10%

Batten Down The Hatches
This prepares the ship for a storm or other dangerous weather. The ship's Seaworthiness is
temporarily raised by 1D4 points. Any damage to the ship's Seaworthiness is taken from these
temporary points first. While the hatches are battened down, the ship cannot fire guns.
Requires: 1 hour.
Handiwork Modifier: -10%

False Colours
By displaying false flags and hiding its extra guns and large crew, a pirate vessel can disguise itself
as a merchantman.
Requires: 1 hour
Consumes: 1D6 tons of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: -10%

Partial Repairs
This repairs 1D6 points of Structural Damage or 1 point of Seaworthiness.
Requires: 1D6 hours
Consumes: 1D6 tons of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: -10%


Repair
One thing is certain about a ship - it will always be in need of repair. Ships lose Seaworthiness as
part of their normal operation, wear and tear that must be attended to eventually. In addition to
this is the damage to a ship's Structure Points that occur through combat.


Cost of Repair
A ship requires 10 silvers worth of materials to repair every lost point of Seaworthiness. Repairing
lost Structure Points requires 100 silvers worth of materials for every point.


Repair Crews
Ship repair crews work in exactly the same manner as construction crews and cost the same. A
standard repair crew can repair 10 points of Seaworthiness or four Structure Points per day on a
beached or dry docked ship.

If he is working alone, a ship's carpenter can repair three points of Seaworthiness or one Structure
Point per day on a beached or dry docked ship.


Repairs at Sea
While at sea, any Handiwork skill tests suffer a -40% penalty.

When attempting to repair a ship at sea, the carpenter must attempt a Handiwork Skill Test
every 12 hours. Success indicates he has repaired one lost point of Seaworthiness or one Structure
Point. This can be increased by an additional +1D4 points if there are sufficient crewmen
available to form a work squad.

If the ship's carpenter fails his Handicraft Skill Test, no repairs are made but the supplies used in
the attempt are still consumed.


Vessel Damage
A ship can meet its end in one of two ways. A ship that loses all its Seaworthiness points will
begin taking on water at a rate faster than the water can be expelled, causing it to sink. A ship
may also be destroyed through the loss of all its Structure Points as a result of damage from
weather and enemies.


Seaworthiness
All ships are fashioned from timber and nails, and all of them continually take on water. The
question is exactly how much water. Bailing water from a ship's bilge is a normal part of a sailor's
daily duties and larger ships always carry at least one carpenter (and spare lumber) to make
emergency repairs when needed.

So long as a ship has at least one Seaworthiness point remaining, the water comes into the ship
at a slower rate than it is expelled by the actions of the crew. Once the ship's Seaworthiness falls
to zero, its day is done. The vessel will begin to swamp, a process that takes one Crew Combat
Round for every 30 feet of the ship's length. When a ship is fully swamped, it will sink.

Every time a ship suffers 10 or more points of structural damage from a single attack, reduce the
Seaworthiness of the ship by one point.


Structure Points
If a ship's Structure Points are ever reduced to zero, the ship immediately begins to break apart.
What remains is useful only as life rafts for the surviving crew.


Dangers
The sea is a dangerous place to be. Even without the potential dangers of enemy ships and rival
pirates, threats such as storms and fires can imperil a ship.


Disease
Bad food, fetid conditions below decks and tropical heat conspire to make fever a danger on
board ship. Some ports are also especially dangerous. If a disease breaks out on board ship,
then the crew must make a Resilience test. If this test fails, then 1D6 x 5% of the crew fall ill
initially. Each week, another Resilience test should be made. If this test fails, then the number
infected rises by 10% and 10% of those already infected fall dead. If the test is successful, then
the number infected falls by 10% and only 5% of those infected die.

If a ship has a doctor on board, then the doctor may make a Healing test. If this test is successful,
then the crew gets a +20% bonus to its Resilience test.


Fire
Small fires are very common aboard ships, although they are always carefully contained. A fire
that escapes control is, however, a real danger to a ship. If not extinguished, an uncontrolled fire
aboard a ship will grow one size category every 2D6 minutes.

Every Combat Round during which the fire rages, the Games Master should roll damage dice
and apply the damage directly to the ship's Structure Points.


Storms
The most terrible danger facing a ship at sea is the weather. The wind and the sea combine to
strike at the tossing ship with a primal fury, as masts creak and crack in the gale, leaks spray water
into the hold and cargo bursts its ties to tumble about the storm-wracked deck.

For a ship to survive a storm intact, the captain must employ his Shiphandling skill (or Boating
skill if necessary) to keep the vessel steady and turned into the storm. If the Skill Test is successful,
the ship endures one hour of storm weather at a cost of only one Seaworthiness. If the Skill Test
fails, the ship endures one hour of storm weather at a cost 1D6 Seaworthiness.



Running Aground
Reefs and sandbars spell the doom for more ships than any pirate. If an unexpected reef lies
ahead on the ship's course, then the lookout is permitted a Perception test to notice the reef and
then the helmsman may make a Shiphandling test to avoid it. If this fails, then the ship risks
running around. Roll 1D6 x (1D6-2) for the depth of the reef below the water (if the result is
negative, then the reef actually pokes above the surface.) The ship takes 1D4 points of Structural
Damage and loses an equal amount of Seaworthiness for every foot of the ship's draft that strikes
the reef. For example, if a ship with a draft of 15 feet runs into a reef that is 10 feet below the
surface, then it takes 5D4 damage. If the ship is still seaworthy, then it can possibly be floated off
the reef at high tide by lightening it.


Beaching a Ship
Beaching a ship is normally only done in the most dire circumstances. Canoes, rowboats and
rafts can be beached with impunity, though even they have a 25% chance of losing a point of
Seaworthiness when they do so.

Beaching other ships requires the crew to make a Shiphandling test with a penalty of between 0%
and 100%, depending on the suitability of the beach and the time taken. If the ship is carefully
sailed into shallow waters, then slowly rolled onto its side by moving the cannons and other
weights, then the penalty is lessened. Sailing onto the shore in the teeth of a fierce storm incurs
a much bigger penalty. Success on this test merely results in the ship losing 1D6 Seaworthiness
and 1D6 Structure Points. Failure results in the ship losing its draft x D10 (minimum of 1D10)
in both Seaworthiness and structure points, as the ship effectively crashes into the shore.


Careening
The warm waters of the Caribbean are a paradise for weeds, worms and other parasites, and a
ship will quickly find itself befouled by all manner of things clinging to its lower hull. These
weeds create drag, slowing a ship down considerably. A wise pirate, therefore, will careen his
vessel regularly, to keep it moving swiftly and smoothly through the ocean.

Each week of sailing, roll 1D6. On a 6, then the ship's speed drops by 6 ft/1 knot until it is
careened.

To careen a ship, it must be beached or put into a dock. The crew then scrape the bottom clear
of debris. This takes 1D3 days and a successful Handiwork test. Each successful attempt at
careening brings the ship's speed back up by 6 ft/1 knot.

piracy and plunder

This chapter has a great number of random tables, which the Games Master can use for random
encounters and prizes. If the Adventurers just want to sail around the Caribbean stealing ships,
then you need look no further!

These random encounters should be used to fill the gaps between pre-planned episodes, or to
give ideas for new adventures. Even a minor prize like a sloop could contain some surprising
revelation - for example, if one of the passengers on the sloop is a Spanish official and he knows
that a galleon loaded with treasure has put into a lightly-defended harbour in Tobago. Suddenly,
the pirates have a target to aim for...


Weather
At the start of a voyage, roll on the Random Weather Change table. Add +4 during the Summer:

##### Random Weather Change

Roll D20        Weather
<10             Calm - roll on the Random Weather table. That weather persists for one week.

Each day, a crew must make a Shiphandling test, modified as per the Random Weather table. If
this test is failed, then the ship loses one Seaworthiness (or more, in extreme weather).




Daily Checklist
•	     Mark off the provisions consumed by the crew (each ton of provisions contains 500
  man/days of food). If the crew runs out of food, they must make a Morale test each day.
•	     Roll for weather. If the weather is a Moderate Wind or more, then the crew must make
  a Shiphandling test to avoid losing one or more points of Seaworthiness.
•	     Roll for an Encounter At Sea.

Each week, roll to see if the vessel needs to be careened.


Pirate Activity Modifiers
If word reaches port of a pirate operating in a particular area, then the authorities may take
action. The Pirate Activity Modifier of a region rises by +1 each week, to the maximum listed.
The Pirate Activity Modifier is added directly onto rolls on the Encounters At Sea and Naval
Vessel tables.

Encounters At Sea
The following series of tables allow the Games Master to determine randomly what sort of ships
or events the Adventurers encounter at sea. One roll should be made each day at sea. Choose the
appropriate column for the ship's current location.

The possible locations are:
Near Port: Roll on this column if the ship is within a few hour's sail of a major port.
Settled Coast: Roll on this column if the ship is near an island or mainland that has been settled
by one of the great powers.
Wild Coast: For unexplored, uncharted or just unsettled regions.
Open Seas: Roll on this column if the ship is at sea in an unremarkable area of the Caribbean.
Trade Route: Roll on this column if the ship is at sea along one of the major trade routes.
Backwater: Roll on this column if the ship is at sea in a little-travelled or unexplored region.
High Seas: Roll on this column if the ship is at sea on the open ocean between the Old World
and the New.

Step One: Crew
Once the type of ship(s) encountered has been determined using the tables, the next step is to
determine what sort of crew and plunder she carries. Roll on the Crew Size, Crew Quality and
Crew Morale tables. Naval or Pirate vessels roll 1D6+6 instead of 2D6 on Crew Size rolls.

##### Crew Size

Crew Size 2D6                        Crew Is

12-13                    Excellent           75%             +2
14                       Fearsome            100%            +4

Naval vessels may add +2 to their roll.

Remember to add the modifiers for Morale and Crew to the crew's Base Skill!

Step Two: Details
Roll on the Notable Officers table next. Assume that all other positions are filled by an officer
that gives +5% to the crew's skill. Next, roll for the other ship's Nationality.

##### Notable Officers

12                                       Portuguese

At this point, the next move is up to the Adventurers. Do they pursue the ship? Ignore it? Attack
it? Meet and parlay? If they attack, move to the Combat on the High Seas chapter on page 79.

If the Adventurers capture a ship, roll on the Plunder tables.



Plunder
Piles of gold and jewels, rich silks and spices from the Orient - or just a few barrels of rotting fish
and worm-ridden timber? The Plunder tables give random plunder for each type of ship. There
are two tables for each vessel - the Bulk Cargo (carried in the ship's hold) and the Rare Cargo
(normally kept in cabins or chests).


A Note on Random Tables
There is an infamous story told in an old Dragon magazine about a space-faring game. The players
showed up and spent a few hours rolling up their characters and their brand new ship. They
are all excited and enthused about the idea of playing space-travelling traders and adventurers.
Finally, the game kicks off. Their ship leaves the space station and jumps into hyperspace. Their
navigator rolls his Hyperspace Navigation skill and passes with ease.

However, in the system they were using, there is a tiny chance that a jump will go wrong anyway
and it does. They randomly hit an asteroid as they fly. The Games Master rolls the size of the
asteroid (a small moon), the location hit (main reactor) and the result (everyone dies). So, by
hewing too closely to the random results, the Games Master killed off all the characters at the
very start of the campaign.

What's the moral of the story? It's not that random tables are bad - they are a very useful tool
for simulating the vagaries of life, which works well for some styles of gaming. No, it is that the
Games Master is in charge, not the tables, and he should always make the game exciting. To take
a similar situation, it is possible for the Adventurers' ship to run aground on a sandbar and sink
on their very first day as pirates. If the Games Master rolls that result, then he should ask himself
what would serve the game best. Perhaps he should just reroll? Or maybe the Adventurers do lose
their ship and the game turns into a bitter struggle for survival as the Adventurers and the other
pirates find themselves on a deserted atoll. Or perhaps a merchant vessel picks the Adventurers
up as their ship sinks and they need to pretend they are honest sailors until they can take over the
merchantman and refit it as their new pirate ship.


Why Have Random Encounters At All?
It could be argued that random encounters are an anachronism in role-playing games. Instead
of rolling on all these endless tables to determine the encounter, why should the Games Master
not just choose what the Adventurers encounter? Why have a random encounter that contributes
nothing to the overall story?

While a Games Master can certainly choose an encounter instead of rolling it randomly, random
rolls can be fun! Players like rolling dice and the thrill of randomly happening upon an especially
rich or dangerous prize is all the greater because blind fate dictated it, instead of the Games
Master choosing it.

As for random encounters not contributing to the overall story, that is not strictly true. By
their very nature, role-playing games have to be 'looser' than movies or novels. With several
protagonists (the Adventurers) and no central authority on events, it is difficult for a roleplaying
game to have both the rising actions and reversals needed for a good story, and the character
development and exploration desired by players. Random and throw-away encounters give the
interactive story time to breathe.

Provisions: These are basic foodstuffs, such as fresh water, beer, bread, salt meat, hardtack and so
forth - just what a ship's crew needs to eat. Provisions are used on a voyage, not traded.

Supplies: Rope, sails, nails, pitch, timber and other materials needed to repair a ship.

Ammo: Powder and shot for cannons.



Common Plunder: A ship carries a wide variety of goods. For each die or value listed, roll on
the Common Plunder table. For example, if a ship's Plunder is listed as 2x2D10 Common, you
would roll twice on the Common Plunder table. There would be 2D10 tons of the first result on
board and 2D10 tons of the second result.

# Combat on the High Seas

This chapter covers maiming, brutality, sword-fights, boarding actions, ship-to-ship battles and
exactly what happens when a cannon explodes in your face.

The standard Legend rules serve admirably for most fights in a pirate game. For bloody struggles
between a band of pirates and an unfortunate crew, or a running skirmish between escaped
prisoners and the naval officers trying to recapture them, the rules are used without modification.
There are two situations, however, where more detailed rules are needed for personal combat.
These are Duels and Crew Combat.

A Duel is a fight between a small number of Adventurers (usually only two) which the Games
Master wishes to lavish more detail on than the average fight. A Duel might be a literal duel with
rapiers, a fistfight, or a desperate battle on a sinking ship.

By contrast, a Crew Combat is a boarding action, a mutiny, or a battle on land involving a dozen
or more fighters on either side, where the normal rules for combat would take too long.


Duels
A Duel works just like a normal Legend melee combat, with the added complexity of Advantage.
Advantage is a measure of how much one combatant is controlling the movement and tempo
of the fight. Only one Adventurer in a fight can hold the Advantage at any given moment -
that Adventurer is said to be Favoured in the fight. If the opponent does something to gain
Advantage, then subtract the Advantage gained from the Favoured Adventurer's total. If this
would reduce the Favoured Adventurer's Advantage to a negative number, then the opponent
becomes Favoured instead, with a positive Advantage total equal to the excess gain.

For example, the pirates Bartholomew and Morgan are fighting a duel. Bartholomew made several
successful attacks, and now has an Advantage of +3. As Bartholomew has the advantage, he is the
Favoured combatant. Morgan executes a particularly clever riposte that garners him 6 points of
Advantage. He subtracts this from Bartholomew's total, bringing it down to 0. The remaining three
points go into a new Advantage for Matthew.

The easiest way to keep track of Advantage is by putting a 10 sided die between the combatants.
Move it closer to whatever Adventurer is currently favoured. When the Favoured Adventurer
gains more Advantage, he increases the number shown on the die; when the opponent gains
Advantage, he decreases the number on the die, or moves it over to his side if he becomes
Favoured.


Optional Rule: Fighting Aboard Ship
On a small vessel like a sloop, there is hardly enough room to take two paces without having to
step over a coiled rope, hatchway, chest or other obstacle. There is little space to swing a sword
in a fight. Therefore, most weapons suffer a penalty of -10% to hit in cramped conditions such
as the deck of a ship.

An Adventurer who does not care about slicing through lines can ignore this penalty but if he
fails an attack roll by more than 20%, then his weapon has gotten caught on some obstacle and
he is disarmed.

Weapons such as axes, cutlasses and daggers are therefore better than rapiers or polearms on
board ship. Weapons suitable for use in cramped conditions are listed on page 29.

Some conditions, such as the lower decks of a ship or a cave, are so cramped that anything larger
than a knife suffers a penalty.




Gaining Advantage
There are several ways to increase or decrease an Advantage score:

•	     Opposed Rolls: An Adventurer gains one point of Advantage whenever he beats an
  opponent's score by more than 20% in an opposed roll. In melee combat, where attack
  rolls are opposed by Parry or Dodge, then advantage will flow back and forth quickly.
•	     Successful Hits: Instead of dealing damage on a successful hit, an Adventurer can instead
  choose to gain 1D6 points of Advantage.
•	     Hero Points: An Adventurer may spend a Hero Point to gain 1D6 points of Advantage.




Witty Repartee
Optionally, in Cinematic games, an Adventurer in a Duel can gain Advantage through witty
repartee. Once per round, an Adventurer may insult or bait his opponent. If the opponent cannot
respond wittily to this opening gambit, then the character gains +1 Advantage. If the opponent
does respond, then the opponent gains +1 Advantage unless the Adventurer also responds in
kind. The Adventurers keep trading insults until either one Adventurer cannot respond wittily.

The Games Master (in a duel between two Adventurers) or the other players (in a duel between
an Adventurer and a Non-Player Characters) are the audience, and should laugh or groan
appropriately. If a line elicits no response, then it has failed.

Optionally, a player can make an Influence check to get a suggestion from the other players, if he
is stuck and cannot come up with a good line.


Using Advantage
There are several distinct advantages, so to speak, to having the Advantage in a fight. There are
two 'passive' bonuses that apply all the time, as long as an Adventurer is favoured:

•	   Bonus to Attack rolls: An Adventurer gains a +10% bonus to all his attacks for every 5
  points of Advantage he holds, or portion thereof. So, an Adventurer with even a single point
  of Advantage gets a +10% bonus; an Adventurer with +11 Advantage gets a massive +30%
  bonus to hit.
•	   Bonus to Parries: An Adventurer gains a +5% bonus to all his parries for every 5 points
  of Advantage he holds, or portion thereof. So, an Adventurer with even a single point of
  Advantage gets a +5% bonus; an Adventurer with +11 Advantage gets a +15% bonus to parry.

Advantage can also be spent as part of an attack in several ways.

•	   Force Movement: If an Adventurer is in melee with a foe, he can force his foe to move by
  spending Advantage. The Adventurer spends one point of Advantage per metre he wishes
  to move and both foes must move back or forth as the Adventurer chooses. If the opponent
  does not wish to move, then the Adventurer gets a Reaction free attack, and the opponent's
  Evade score is penalised by 50%. Using this move, an Adventurer can force an opponent
  back over a cliff, into a cramped area, or into a burning building.
•	   Bonus Damage: An Adventurer can increase damage from a successful hit by spending
  Advantage. Each point of Advantage spent increases damage by +1. The Advantage must
  be spent after the attack is deemed to be successful but before the damage dice are rolled.


Resetting Advantage
There are several ways an Adventurer who is losing a fight can 'reset' the Advantage back to 0, so
that no Adventurer is favoured.

•	   Breaking Off: If neither combatant in a fight makes an attack roll in a round, then the
  Advantage resets to 0.
•	   Changing The Nature Of The Fight: A switch from melee to grappling, or from armed
  melee to unarmed melee resets the Advantage to 0.
•	   Blinding, distracting or otherwise stunning the opponent: Such an event resets the
  Advantage to 0.


Reversing Advantage
If the Adventurer who is not favoured gets a critical result in an opposed roll, and the favoured
Adventurer fails, then the Advantage is immediately reversed and the unfavoured Adventurer
becomes favoured.


Duels with Multiple Participants
While the Duel rules are intended to be used to model fights where two Adventurers vie for
victory, they can be extended to larger fights. If there are multiple combatants on each side, say
a two against two or three versus three battle, then the rules are used as normal, except that the
passive bonuses to Parries and Attacks are not used.


Optional Rule: Fatigue in Pirates Games
The Legend rules for Fatigue rarely come into play, because normal combat is only Medium
activity, so Adventurers can keep fighting for a number of minutes equal to their CON without
risking becoming Fatigued. While this rule supports the dungeon crawling or heroic questing
of fantasy adventurers, it does not reflect the more mortal Adventurers of Pirates of Legend
campaigns.

It is suggested, then, that the following rules changes are made in Pirates of Legend games to
fatigue:

•	   All combat counts as Heavy Activity. Therefore, an Adventurer can only fight for a number
of rounds equal to his CON score before risking Fatigue.
•	   Adventurers recover from fatigue slightly faster, as the following table shows:

Current State           To recover up to the next state takes...
                        Full Rest                           Light Activity
Fresh                   -                                   -
Winded                  One round                           One minute
Wearied                 Five minutes                        One hour
Exhausted               Four hours                          -
Debilitated             Eight hours                         -

Even if the change in the Fatigue rating of combat is not made for normal fights, it is strongly
recommended that Duels count as Heavy activity.




Formal Duels
Formal duels are a gentleman's way of settling disputes and matters of honour that cannot be
addressed in any fashion save bloodshed. In a duel, the challenged party is permitted the pick
of weapons - pistols or swords are normally chosen. Duels take place at a time agreed upon by
both parties, although they never take place on the same night as the offence that provoked the
quarrel.

Each participant nominates a second, who watches for cheating. In a pistol duel, the seconds
load the weapons; a second will also fight the duel if the challenger or challenged is incapacitated
or sick.

Duels normally go on until First Blood, which occurs when a location takes three or more points
of damage. When a participant is wounded, then he should yield and give himself up to the
mercy of the victor.


Pirate Duels
Duels between pirates are never so formal, unless the participants are gentlemen of honour who
have somehow fallen into piracy. Pirate duels almost never take place on board a ship - the
brotherhood should be united when at sea, so disputes should be settled on the shore. Unlike a
formal duel, pirate duels tend to be to the death. Instead of a second, there is normally a ring of
cheering and jeering pirates, out for the sight of blood. Some duels even involve the participants
being bound together, or blindfolded, or take place on sandbars of sucking mud or on bare rocks
with the tide rising swiftly.


Pistol Duels
In a pistol duel, both participants start back to back. They then take a predetermined number of
steps apart, then turn and fire. The Adventurers roll their Strike Rank when they have taken the
requisite number of steps. An Adventurer can cheat, turning and firing early. In such cases, the
cheater gets a +1D6 bonus to his Strike Rank.

When firing, both Adventurers get a +25% bonus to their Pistols skill, due to the formal
conditions and predictability of the opponent's location.



Duel Summary
•	   Only one side can have advantage at any time.
•	   Whenever you win a roll, you either gain +1 Advantage, or take -1 Advantage away from
  your opponent.
•	   Whoever has Advantage gains a bonus to attacks and parries.
•	   Advantage can also be spent to increase damage and perform other special attacks.
•	   Advantage is reversed if the currently disadvantaged party gets a critical success.
•	   Advantage can be reset to 0 by pausing or changing the nature of a fight.




Crew Combat
Crew Combat is a more abstract combat system, used when there are lots of combatants
on either side, too many to bother keeping track of individually. The size of units in Crew
Combat varies and should be set to a convenient value. For example, in a sea battle between
two crews of 200 men, then splitting each crew into four 50-man groups would make sense.
In a boarding action, when the pirates send a few 20-man boats across the water, then each
boat might be a unit.

Crew combat works in a similar way to normal combat, with the following changes:

•	   Crew combat rounds are 30 seconds long.
•	   There are no Strike Ranks. The attacking force goes first, followed by the defenders. If there
  is no clear attacking force, then both sides roll 1D10, highest goes first, re-rolling ties.
•	   To make a Crew Combat attack, the leader of the crew (normally, the quartermaster or the
  gunner) makes a check against the appropriate skill (Firearms or Hand-To-Hand). This
  check may be modified by conditions. Hand to hand tests are opposed.
•	   Crew damage is not measured in hit points lost - instead, a unit may be Fresh, Wounded,
  Seriously Wounded, Mauled or Slaughtered.
•	   At the end of a Crew Combat Round, one or both crews must make Morale tests.
•	   Adventurers can make Heroic Actions during Crew Combat, which inspire their companions
  and give bonuses to the result.


Crew Health, Crew Damage & Individual Adventurers
A crew's health is measured in levels. The levels are Fresh (unhurt), Wounded, Seriously
Wounded, Mauled and Slaughtered. When a crew suffers an attack, it might drop down one
or more health levels. Alternatively, it may also suffer a bonus to the next damage roll made
against it - this models some of the crew being injured but not so many that the crew as a whole
is affected. For example, if the result on a damage roll is '+3 to next damage roll', then the next
time in the battle that the crew is injured, then 3 is added to the roll.

Running Wounds Totals vanish when a crew actually takes damage.

If a Slaughtered crew takes further damage, then it is removed from the battle (but most crews
will break long before taking such punishment).

At the end of a battle, the actual damage on the crew is determined. A crew that has been
Slaughtered may in fact have lost only a few sailors, or it could have been killed almost to a man.
It is hard to tell, in the press and chaos of battle, who has been killed and who has merely been
horribly maimed. See Aftermath, page 88.

For individual Adventurers in a battle the following table shows roughly what the various crew
health levels translate to. However, this is only an average result - in a unit that just got reduced
from Fresh to Wounded, there would be plenty of pirates who have not been injured at all and
an unlucky fellow or two who are dead or maimed.

Crew Is...                              Individual Damage
Fresh                                   No damage
Wounded                                 Minor damage to random location
Seriously Wounded                       Minor wound to random location
Maimed                                  Serious wound to random location
Slaughtered                             Major wound to random location
Dead                                    Dead

Attacker on unstable ground (including a ship)                        -20%
Target has moved 100 feet or more since the last round                -10%

Note that modifiers for target size are not used.




Severely Outnumbered Attackers & Ranged Attacks
No matter how good your crew's shooting is, the amount of lead shot they can put into the air is
limited by the number of guns they have. Therefore, in cases where a small handful of men are
firing at a much larger group, a modifier is applied to their Ranged damage rolls.

Twice as many defenders as attackers: -1 to damage
Three times: -2 to damage
Four times: -3 to damage, and so forth.

So, if you are outnumbered five to one, you suffer a -4 penalty to your ranged attack damage
rolls.


Cover & Fortifications
Cover also reduces the damage from Ranged attacks.

Thick Vegetation: -1 damage
Light Cover (low walls, ship railings): -2 damage
Medium Cover (wooden buildings): -3 damage
Heavy Cover (stone fort): -4 damage



Ranged Attacks
Ranged Attack: To make a ranged attack on another crew, the crew makes a Firearms check, as
modified by the Crew Combat Modifiers listed in the sidebar.

A critical success gives a +6 bonus to the damage roll.

Ranged Damage: Roll 2D6 and compare to the Ranged Damage table.

Ranged Damage
Roll                 Successful Firearms Check                       Failed Firearms Check
1 or less            +1 to next roll                                 No damage
2                    +1 to next roll                                 No damage
3                    +1 to next roll                                 No damage
4                    +2 to next roll                                 No damage
5                    +2 to next roll                                 No damage
6                    +3 to next roll                                 +1 to next roll
7                    +3 to next roll                                 +1 to next roll
8                    One damage level                                +2 to next roll
9                    One damage level                                +2 to next roll
10                   Two damage levels                               +3 to next roll
11                   Two damage levels                               +3 to next roll
12                   Three damage levels                             One damage level
13+                  Three damage levels                             Two damage levels

A Crew must make a Morale test whenever it takes a damage level - see Morale tests.

For example, a band of twenty pirates ambush a column of 40 guards and mine workers at a gold
mine on the Spanish coast. The pirates are an Average crew, giving them a base Firearms score of 50%.
They are lead by an experienced gunner and have good morale, increasing their score to 60%.

The pirates ambush the enemy, giving them a +40% bonus to their attack, and fire from a rise
overlooking a trail through the jungle, giving them an extra +10%. Unsurprisingly, they hit with
their opening barrage.

They are outnumbered by the enemy, so they suffer a -1 penalty to their damage roll. The pirates roll
an 11, -1 for a result of 10. This is a result of two damage levels, bringing the enemy down from Fresh
to Seriously Wounded. The Spanish also have to make a Morale test.

The pirates fire again next round, as the Spanish struggle up the slope towards them. The pirates have
lost the bonus for surprise, reducing their Firearms chance to hit to only 70% (60%, +10% for their
good position). The firearms test fails, so the pirates roll on the Failed column of the damage table.
They roll a 7, modified down by the fact they're outnumbered to a 6. The result is that the next time
the Spanish suffer damage, the roll on the damage table will be increased by +1.

Of course, the pirates will not get a chance to fire again, as the Spanish are upon them and it's time
to draw cutlasses!


Hand to Hand Attacks
Unlike Ranged Attacks, Hand to Hand attacks are opposed tests - both groups of combatants make
a Hand to Hand test and the damage depends on which side won the test. If both succeed, then
whoever rolled the highest or got a critical wins. If both fail, then whoever rolled the lowest wins.

Hand to Hand attacks are modified as follows:


Hand to Hand Combat Modifiers
Attackers outnumber defenders                       +10%
Attackers considerably outnumber defenders          +20%
Attackers vastly outnumber                          +40%
Good equipment                                      +5%
Excellent equipment                                 +10%
Defensive position                                  +10% to +50%, depending on conditions
Surprise                                            +40%
Crew is Wounded                                     -10%
Crew is Seriously Wounded                           -20%
Crew is Mauled                                      -30%
Crew is Slaughtered                                 -50%

A critical success gives a +6 bonus to the damage roll.

Hand to Hand: Roll 2D6 and add the crew's average Damage Modifier to the roll, then compare
to the Hand to Hand Damage table. Separate rolls are made for both sides.


Hand to Hand Damage
Roll               Loser of Opposed Check                    Winner of Opposed Check
1 or less          +1 Running Wounds Total                   No damage
2                  +1 Running Wounds Total                   No damage
3                  +1 Running Wounds Total                   No damage
4                  +2 Running Wounds Total                   No damage
5                  +2 Running Wounds Total                   No damage
6                  +3 Running Wounds Total                   +1 Running Wounds Total
7                  +3 Running Wounds Total                   +1 Running Wounds Total
8                  One damage level                          +2 Running Wounds Total
9                  One damage level                          +2 Running Wounds Total
10                 Two damage levels                         +3 Running Wounds Total
11                 Two damage levels                         +3 Running Wounds Total
12                 Three damage levels                       One damage level
13+                Three damage levels                       Two damage levels

To continue the example of the pirate ambush, the Severely Wounded Spanish reach the pirate
ambushers on the hill. The Pirates have a Hand to Hand score of 55%; the Spanish have a score of
40%.


The pirates have no applicable modifiers to their Hand to Hand score.
The Spanish have several modifiers, although they are Seriously Wounded (-20%) and they outnumber
their foe (+10%), giving them a final score of 30%.

An opposed roll is made - the Pirates roll a 19, and the Spanish roll a 98. The pirates have won the
roll.

Now, onto damage. Damage rolls are made for both sides. For the damage suffered by the pirates, the
roll is a 7, +1 damage to the next roll, so nothing too serious.

For the Spanish, the roll is a 7 - BUT there is a still a +1 Running Wounds Total hanging over the
Spanish from the last round of shooting. This increases the damage roll to an 8, for one level of damage.
The Seriously Wounded Spanish are reduced to Mauled. This fight will soon be over...


Morale Tests
A Morale test must be made whenever:

•	      A crew is reduced by one damage level.
•	      A crew loses a Hand to Hand combat with a foe that considerably outnumbers them.
•	      Something happens to demoralise the crew, such as their ship exploding or their captain
   dying before their eyes (assuming they like their captain).
•	      In sea battles, Morale tests can also be triggered by raising a pirate flag, or by vapouring.

A Morale test is made using the crew's Persistence score. If this test is failed, then the crew's nerve
has faltered and they lose one level of Morale. On a critical success, the crew is galvanised by the
challenge and gains one level of Morale.

If a Crew in battle is reduced to Low Morale, then they must make a Morale test every round, as
their nerve slips. A Mutinous crew surrenders or flees, depending on circumstances.


Aftermath
When a Crew Combat is finished, it is time to count the casualties and bury the dead. The crew
must make a Resilience test to determine how severe the damage was, then consult the Aftermath
table. Any outstanding Running Wounds Totals are directly translated into dead crew.

Aftermath
Crew Was...                 Successful Resilience Test            Failed Resilience Test
Fresh                       No lasting damage                     1D3 crew killed, 10% injured
Wounded                     1D6 crew killed, 10% injured          2D6 crew killed, 20% injured
Seriously Wounded           3D6 crew killed, 20% injured          4D6 crew killed, 30% injured
Mauled                      4D6 crew killed, 30% injured          6D6 crew killed, 50% injured
Slaughtered                 6D6 crew killed, 50% injured          2D6 survivors, all injured

To finish our example of the pirate ambush - the Spanish broke after the short hand-to-hand
engagement, falling back down the slope leading to the chests of gold dust lying on the track. The
pirates are victorious - but at what cost? The pirates were never reduced below Fresh but they must
still make a Resilience test.


The pirates fail their test, so they suffer 1D6 casualties, +1 for the +1 Running Wounds Total still
hanging over them. Five pirates have died, and 10% of their number - another 2 - have been injured.

Meanwhile, back in the Spanish fort, the enemy count their dead. The Spanish were reduced to
Mauled but they pass their Resilience test. Of the 40 Spanish, 4D6 are dead, and another 30% (13)
are wounded.


Heroic Actions
In a battle, Adventurers may get a chance to perform Heroic Actions, which are great deeds
that inspire the crew. Heroic Actions can give a bonus to the Crew. Remember, Crew Combat
Rounds take 30 seconds, while normal Adventurer-scale rounds only take five seconds, so there
are six Adventurer-scale rounds per Crew Combat Round.

Sample Heroic Actions, and their effects on the battle as a whole, are listed here:

##### Heroic Actions

Action                                                         Bonus to Crew
Inspiring the crew through conspicuous bravery                 Re-roll a failed Morale test
Duelling the opponent's leader                                 +5% Hand to Hand
Leading a few crack gunners to catch the foe in a crossfire    +5% Firearms
Saving a wounded crewmate                                      -2 to the next damage roll made against your crew
Throwing yourself into the fight                               +2 to the next damage roll made against the enemy


Crew Combat Summary
•	     Instead of Hit Points, crews have abstract health levels and a Running Wound Total. The
    Running Wound total adds to damage rolls and resets to zero whenever a crew loses a
    health level.
•	     Attacks on crews either reduce health, or add to a Crew's Running Wound Total.
•	     Crews must also make Morale tests whenever they take damage.
•	     At the end of the battle, an Aftermath roll is made to see how many crew were actually
    slain and how many were merely injured.




Special Crew Combats
These situations crop up often enough in pirate games to justify their own special rules.


Cannons
A cannon loaded with standard or chain shot will automatically kill 1D6 Crew on a successful
gunnery test and increases the enemy crew's Running Wounds Total by 1.


A cannon loaded with grape shot deals damage like a normal Firearms attack to a crew. Cannons
are always 'outnumbered' by a crew, so they suffer a penalty to their damage rolls against crews,
as follows:

Swivel Gun/9 pounder: -4
18 pounder: -3
24 pounder: -2
45 pounder: -0


Boarding Actions
When storming another ship, follow these steps:

Step One: Approach
If the Crew is attacking from their ship, then it must be brought alongside the enemy ship
(which requires a successful opposed Shiphandling roll).

If attacking from boats, then they must make a successful Boating test to grapple with the enemy
ship.

In both situations, the attackers will be vulnerable to fire from the target. The Approach takes at
least one round, perhaps more.

Step Two: Boarding
Next round, the Crew must make a Boarding test. This is a Hand to Hand test against whatever
crew are on deck but the attacking Crew suffers a base -50% penalty to their attack roll. They
get a +20% bonus to their attack roll if they have Boarding Axes or Boarding Pikes, or if their
ship is alongside the enemy vessel.

If the attacking Crew fails to do any damage to the enemy crew, then they have been driven back
and may try another Boarding test next round. If they do at least one level of damage to the
enemy crew, then they have won a foothold on the foe's deck and no further boarding actions
need be made.

Note that if the crew boarded from their ship and not from boats, then the enemy crew can
counter-attack without having to make their own Boarding test.

Example: The crew of the Greymantle are trying to board a fishing boat off Newfoundland. They try
to board from their little ship, so they make a Shiphandling test to come alongside. If the fishermen had
guns, then the pirates would be fired on as they closed but the fishing boat has no cannons or muskets.

The pirates come alongside and make a Boarding test. They have a Hand to Hand score of 45%, and the
fishermen have a score of only 30%. However, the pirates suffer a -30% penalty as they try to force their
way on board, so the actual Hand to Hand test is 15% vs. 30%. The pirates, by a quirk of fate, actually
win. They roll a 7 for damage, which does not inflict a damage level on the fishermen, so the boarding
action has actually failed. They can try again next round, however, and will have a +3 Running Wounds
Total. They will likely fight their way onto the fishing boat's deck eventually, but it will be costly.


Sieges
Besieging a fort or walled town is difficult. Cannons can be used to blast through fortifications,
or walls can be stormed by ladders. Especially patient pirates could just blockade a port, stopping
food and supplies from reaching the town.

Ship to Ship Combat
Clashes between ships at sea are resolved as follows:
•	     The two ships either engage each other in battle, or one attempts to flee.
•	     If one tries to flee, the other can give chase.
•	     If they engage, or if the fleeing vessel is caught, then the two battle.
•	     In a battle, both ships move, then exchange fire.
•	     Sailors from one ship can attempt to board the other.
•	     Battle continues until one ship surrenders, is captured, sunk, explodes or otherwise
    defeated.


Battle Stations!
In a battle, some of the pirate crew man the guns, others attend to the lines and the business
of sailing the ship, and others use their muskets to fire at the enemy crew until they come close
enough to board. Civilian ships operate with a much smaller crew and often have only enough
men to sail and man a handful of guns. Warships, like pirate vessels, carry far more sailors than
average.

Before battle, a captain should allocate some of his crew to these three stations:

Sailing Crew: See the description of each ship for the number of sailors needed to crew a ship.
Optionally, a ship can have less than the minimum recommended crew - see page 48 for details
on skeleton and prize crews.

Gunnery Crew: See the description of each cannon for the number of sailors needed to operate
it. Cannons can be undermanned but this increases the amount of time it takes to reload the
weapon. A minimum of one man per cannon is required.

Boarding Crew: The rest of the crew fires muskets from the deck when in range, or engages in
boarding actions. This crew can also vapour to intimidate the enemy.

Damage to these three crews should be tracked separately on the crew sheet.




Sighting Ships
Spotting an enemy vessel requires a successful Perception test, modified as follows. A look-out in
a crow's nest can see about 8-10 miles.

Condition                                  Perception Modifier
Target is
A rowboat or other boat                    -50%
A small vessel                             -25%
An average vessel                          -10%
A large vessel                             +0%
A very large vessel                        +10%
An island                                  +25%
Coastline                                  +50%
Lit up at night                            +40%
Weather conditions                         Up to -100%

A spyglass gives a +20% bonus to Perception tests.

Pirate Flags: When sighted by the enemy, the pirate captain can choose to raise his pirate flag.
If this is done, then the enemy crew must immediately make a Morale test, penalised by the
captain's Reputation:


Reputation                                       Modifier to Morale
1-2                                              -
3-5                                              -5%
6-10                                             -10%
11-15                                            -15%
16-20                                            -20%
21-25                                            -20%
26-30                                            -25%
31-40                                            -35%
41-50                                            -40%

Remember, if a crew's Morale is reduced to Mutinous, then they will likely surrender or flee.
Pirates can also use Vapouring to further attack an enemy crew's Morale.

No Quarter: A captain can also choose to raise the red flag of slaughter, declaring that he will
offer no mercy to the enemy crew. If this is done, then the enemy crew must make a Morale
test immediately but it also means they will not surrender; they will fight to the last (or mutiny
against their commander and try to join the pirates).


Chases
In a chase, both ships make opposed Shiphandling tests. The winner may increase the relative
movement of their ship by 1D6 x 6 feet this Crew Combat Round.

When being chased, the pursuing ship can fire its chase guns and the pursued ship can return
fire with aft guns.


Manoeuvring
If ships are closing for battle, then they can manoeuvre for better position. There are several
manoeuvres that can be attempted - if miniatures or other representations are being used then
questions about line of sight and firing arcs can be resolved there. Alternatively, manoeuvres can
be kept abstract, with just the relative positions of the two ships being considered.

A ship running fighting sail or below may turn up to 90 degrees in a single Crew Combat Round.
A ship running plain sail or higher may only turn 45 degrees in a single Crew Combat Round.

If the ship's Helmsman is an Adventurer then he may use his own Shiphandling skill instead of
the crew's skill for these tests.

Only one of the following Manoeuvres may be attempted in a particular round.

Hard Turn!: With a successful Shiphandling test, a ship may turn an extra 45 degrees this round.

Steady!: The helmsman endeavours to hold the ship steady, to provide a stable platform for
firing. If the Shiphandling test is successful, then any Gunnery tests made by the crew this round
gain a +10% bonus.

Evasive Action: By steering erratically or keeping out of the arc of fire of the enemy ship, the
helmsman tries to protect his vessel. If the Shiphandling test is successful, then any Gunnery
attacks on the ship suffer a -10% penalty.

Close For Boarding: The helmsman attempts to bring his vessel close enough to the enemy ship
for boarding. Opposed Shiphandling tests must be made; if the Adventure wins, then the crew
may attempt to board the enemy ship.


Firing
As a ship is pitching up and down in the midst of battle, it counts as Unstable Ground, inflicting a
-20% penalty to all ranged attack rolls. The Steady manoeuvre mitigates this penalty somewhat.
Especially rough conditions can increase this penalty.

Muskets & Small Arms: These attacks take place as normal for Crew Combat. If there are
multiple Crews on the enemy vessel (a boarding party and sailors, for instance), then choose
randomly which crew takes the damage. The hull value of the ship is applied as a modifier to
the damage roll.

Swivel Guns: Each swivel gun fires independently. A swivel gun can be loaded with round shot,
in which case it deals its listed damage (2D6 damage), or grape shot (standard firearms damage
to crew with a -4 penalty).

Cannon: Cannons can be fired in four different ways:
•	   Single Firing with Round Shot
•	   Single Firing with Grape Shot
•	   Single Firing with Chain Shot
•	   Broadside

Single Firing: Single firing a cannon uses the formal Ranged Attack rules, not the Crew Combat
rules. If an Adventurer is alone firing the cannon, he may use his own Gunnery score instead of
that of the crew.


If round shot is used, then the attack deals normal damage for a cannon of that type.

If grape shot is used, then the attack deals damage to the crew of the enemy ship.

If chain shot is used, then the attack must use a Precise Attack (-40%) to accurately aim at the
enemy mast. If this attack is successful, then a critical hit is automatically scored on the enemy
mast. See Cannon Critical Hits.

Broadside: A broadside consists of several cannons firing simultaneously. All the cannons fired
must be of the same time and loaded with the same shot. While each shot is less accurate than
a single shot attack, filling the air with that much lead does aid immensely. A broadside attack,
therefore, has a +20% bonus to the Gunnery test, often counter-acting the penalty from the
ship's Movement.

To be fully effective, a broadside should have at least eight cannon firing simultaneously. For
every cannon less than eight, subtract one when rolling for how many shots actually hit, to a
maximum of -4. A broadside cannot be fired with fewer than four cannon. Larger broadsides
gain a +1 to this roll per extra cannon, to a maximum of 12.

Roll 2D6 on the Broadsides table to determine how many shots actually hit.

If the Gunnery test is a critical, then the broadside scores 1 critical on the enemy ship.

Broadsides

13                 Five hits                                      Three hits
14                 Six hits                                       Three hits
15                 Seven hits                                     Three hits
16                 Eight hits                                     Four hits

Roll the appropriate damage for each hit, remembering to subtract the ship's Hull rating from
the damage for each shot. Each hit also increases the enemy crew's Running Wounds Total by 1.

Reloading Cannons: The time it takes to reload a cannon depends on the operator's Gunnery
skill.


Reloading
                 Combat Actions to reload          Number of Crew Combat rounds to
Gunnery Skill       (Adventurer scale)                reload (Crew Combat scale)

100%+               5                                 1

Swivel guns always take 5 rounds/one Crew Combat Round to reload.

Ammunition: A ton of cannonballs and powder contains fifty shots. Different guns take up
different numbers of shots:


Weapon                                                         Shots used
Swivel Gun                                                     1
9-Pounder                                                      1
18-pounder                                                     2
24-pounder                                                     3
45-pounder                                                     5


Boarding Actions
See page 90 for rules on boarding actions.


Vapouring
Instead of shooting at an enemy crew, or attempting a boarding action, a boarding crew can
engage in the practice called vapouring. This involves creating a din with shouts, banging or
drumming on the sides of the ship, clashing swords, singing, cursing and otherwise intimidating
the enemy. Vapouring can only be attempted when the other crew is close enough to be
intimidated - generally, when the ships are in range of cannons.

To vapour, the boarding crew must make a Perform test. If successful, the enemy must make a
Morale test immediately. A crew can vapour multiple times but the enemy will only lose Morale
from the effect once (the Games Master should roll the result of the Morale test secretly, so the
pirates do not know if their intimidation had any effect).


Sinking Ships
A ship loses one Seaworthiness for every 10 points of damage it suffers from a single attack (i.e.
a single hit from a cannon, not from a whole broadside).

A ship that has lost all its Seaworthiness is now sinking. A ship that has been boarded and
captured can be scuttled, causing it to sink.
 


Destroying Ships
A ship reduced to 0 Structural Points has been smashed to smithereens. Wreckage from the ship
continues to float but the ship is no more. If a ship is carrying gunpowder and ammo aboard in
a powder room, then this can be hit in a battle, either through a critical hit, or through a Heroic
Action as part of a boarding action. A ton of exploding gunpowder barrels does 6D6 Structural
Damage.
 

Aftermath of Battles
Damage to crews is resolved normally after a battle at sea. A diminished pirate crew can often
pick up replacement members from the survivors of a defeated prize, although men forced to go
on the account are rarely loyal to their new pirate brethren and may desert or rebel if the chance
arises.




Critical Hits on Ships
If a cannon attack scores a critical hit on a ship, then roll on the Critical Hits table. Re-roll if the
result makes no sense (such as a mast falling on a rowboat - not that the chances of a rowboat
being anything other than floating wreckage after a cannon hit are very high).

On a successful chain shot attack, roll 1D6 on the Critical Hits table.

##### Critical Hits

Roll        Damage
1-2         Mast Topples - one of the ship's masts falls, halving its Movement, giving a -50% penalty to Shiphandling tests and dealing 4D6 Structure Points of damage
3           Sail Falls - one of the ship's sails plummets to the deck, halving its Movement, giving a -50% penalty to Shiphandling tests and adding 1D6 to the Crew's Running Wounds Total.
4-5         Rigging Damaged - the ship's rigging is damaged, preventing it from changing sail and giving a -20% penalty to Shiphandling tests.
6           Crew Maimed - the attack tears through the crew on deck, adding 2D6 to the Crew's Running Wounds Total.
7           Officer Struck - one of the officers is hit by the cannon ball. If he is an Adventurer, he may spend a Hero Point to be merely thrown overboard instead of killed by the explosion.
8           Fire - a fire has broken out on board. See fires.
9-11        Especially Damaging Hit - roll cannon damage again.
12-13       Cannons Damaged - 1D4 of the ship's cannons are destroyed by the attack.
14-15       Hold Damaged - the ship's hold is hit, destroying 2D20% of the contents.
16-19       Holed Below The Waterline - the ship is holed, losing 2D6 Seaworthiness.
19          Rudder Damage: -50% penalty to Shiphandling test.
20          Magazine Struck: Roll 1D6. On a 4+, the powder explodes, destroying the ship from the inside.


# Ports, Trade and Law

Ports are places to trade goods, to replenish supplies, to get uproariously drunk - but they also
can be the seat of authority in the Caribbean and so many pirates have ended their days hanging
from a gallows at the end of a pier. Especially daring and powerful pirate gangs have even raided
and sacked entire ports! Ports vary in size and importance. Every port will have a few docked
ships and some defences like cannons in a fort overlooking the harbour. The most important
ports are built to resist full-scale attacks by enemy navies and are more than a match for all but
the most audacious rogue.

Pirate Ports are lawless places like Tortuga, Port Royal (before its destruction), the Bahamas
or Madagascar where pirate ships can land safely. Everyone here is a rogue or villain, or at least
friendly to them.

Local Ports and Minor Trade Ports are small ports which might only see a trade ship a handful
of times per year. Pirates sometimes prey on these ports but more often they come here to sell
stolen goods. Many places will accept the cargo of pirate ships if it is sold cheaply enough, no
questions asked. Some landowners are in league with the pirates, sheltering and supplying them
in exchange for cheap goods.

Major Trade Ports are the heart of commerce in the modern age. Ships from Africa and Europe
dock here regularly, bringing manufactured goods and slaves and taking on all the produce of the
Caribbean and the Americas. These places are too law-abiding for the most part to accept known
pirates but disguised pirate vessels or less notorious villains can enter and trade. Taking a major
trade port is a coup for a pirate gang.

Fortresses are rare in the Caribbean - these are major ports with extra guns and fortifications,
the centre of Imperial power in a region.

Entering a Port
When an Adventurer enters a port, roll 1D20 and add his Reputation, then check the Pirate
Reception table:

##### Pirate Reception

D20+Reputation           Result
<10                      The Adventurer is not recognised, he may trade freely.
11-20                    The Adventurer is not recognised but he is found to be suspicious.
21-30                    The Adventurer is recognised as a pirate and may be attacked.
31+                      The Adventurer is recognised and will be attacked if possible.

Roll on the Pirate Reception table again if the Adventurer causes a nuisance, or acts in a very
suspicious way (such as selling off stolen goods openly).


Selling Off Your Ill-Gotten Gains
Having a hold full of stolen spices, silks and blood-stained doubloons is all well and good but
if you cannot trade them for a willing wench and a flagon of ale, what good are they? There are
several ways for a pirate to sell off stolen goods:

•	      Legally: If an Adventurer can enter a port without being identified as a pirate, then he
   can just use the normal trade rules.
•	      Smuggling: An Adventurer can sell on the black market. This works like normal trade
   but smugglers cannot expect to get as good a deal as a legal trader. Pirates dealing with
   smugglers therefore suffer a -50% penalty to their Influence attempts.

Trade
Adventurers can engage in legitimate trade as well as piracy.

The base sale price is listed in the Plunder tables. Goods are bought at a price starting at half
that listed in the tables. An Adventurer may make an Influence test to increase the price by
+10% (+20% on a critical success). Supply and demand can also affect the price (see the Price
Adjustment table).

##### Price Adjustment

Supply & Demand                     Example                                     Price Change

## The Law
While every governor and nation complains about piracy, the various navies are often slow to
react to pirate attacks. Often, the ships sent on the hunt are too slow to catch the pirates, or
unable to enter the shallow coves and shoals where the elusive thieves hide. It is not until the
latter stages of the Age of Piracy that the Royal Navy starts sending smaller, faster ships to hunt
down the pirates.

Governors may also employ mercenaries and privateers to deal with especially troublesome
pirates. When a pirate attacks a ship, there is a chance that it attracts the attention of a governor.
Take the pirate's crime from the Misdemeanour table, add the pirate's Reputation, and roll
1D100 to see if retribution is warranted.

##### Misdemeanour

Prize Taken                                                  Chance of Retribution
Local                                                        0%
Merchant, 100 tons or less cargo space                       10%
Merchant, more than 100 tons                                 20%
Fluyt or convoy                                              30%
Galleon or Naval Vessel                                      40%
Port                                                         50%

The retribution dispatched by the governor will depend on what ships are in harbour and what
sway he has with his government.



Captured Pirates
If a pirate is captured by the authorities, then his remaining few days are likely to be unpleasant.
If there is time and a nearby fortress, or if the authorities wish to question the pirates, then the
condemned men will be brought back to a port and imprisoned there before they are tried. They
may even be sent back to Europe to face trial there - this is especially true for famous pirates
(Reputation 30+), whose trials will attract great attention and prestige. On the other hand, some
of the ordinary pirates may simply be hung there and then, to warn others of the wages of sin.

In a trial, witnesses of the pirate's crimes will be brought forward. Often, a pirate's crew will
turn against him, claiming to have been forced onto the account on pain of death and pleading
for clemency. Offering pardons to pirates is a cheap and easy way to deal with the problem, as
is offering them commissions as privateers. Such loopholes will only be offered, however, if the
pirate is worth more to the authorities alive than dead.


# Campaign ideas

The basic structure of Pirates of Legend is a simple one - roll up your Adventurer, your ship and
your crew, then go off in search of plunder. That basic core remains true for all these campaigns
but there are many ways to explore that same pirate experience with the players.


Historical Piracy
While there is a wealth of books and research material about pirates, most will just point you
at the classic 'A General History of the Most Notorious Pyrates' by Captain Charles Johnson (or
Daniel Defoe, depending on who you ask). This classic book lists the deeds and crimes of, well,
the most notorious pirates, and is an excellent source of adventure ideas. The simplest historical
campaign is a relatively random one - few pirates had a cunning plan for conquest and plunder.
More complex games can delve into the movements of empires and religions in that chaotic
period.

Most historical games will tend towards the gritty and the unpleasant. Non-Player Characters are
more likely to die of dysentery or scurvy than in a dramatic battle at sea. Few pirates prospered
but their own incompetence and lack of discipline was matched only by the navy's indolence and
poor tactics. Historical campaigns will also touch on unpleasant issues, like slavery, and (Anne
Bonny and Mary Read aside) there is little scope for female Adventurers to get involved in on
the action.

Historical campaigns appeal to players who are willing to delve into the details and learn about
the period. Given the length of the Golden Age, it is best to focus on one period or the career of
a particular pirate (Blackbeard or Bartholomew Roberts are prime candidates) and gather all the
information you can about them. The Adventurers could be crew on board those ships - or even
take on the roles of historical figures. For example, Captain Roberts (one of the most successful
pirates on record) travelled for much of his career with a crew of pirates who practically scream
'Adventurer' like Anastis (a huge brute, proud of his physical strength), dour Gillespie, or La
Palisse, who stayed loyal to his battered old sloop even when Roberts captured bigger and bigger
ships for his crew to use.

Another option is to have the Adventurers be the crew on board a merchant ship that is attacked
or taken by pirates. They are forced to go on the account at sword-point due to their skills at
sailing and now have to make the best of a dangerous situation. Do the Adventurers try to escape
and turn on their criminal comrades, or do they embrace the pirate lifestyle and plunder what
they can until the law catches up with them?

The Caribbean in the Golden Age of Piracy is divided between the Great Powers of Europe,
primarily Spain, England, France and the Netherlands. By the 1700s, the original treasure of the
Caribbean - the silver and gold of South America - is nearly gone but the islands are becoming
valuable producers of various goods, notably sugar and tobacco. Diseases brought by the early
explorers ravage the native populations, forcing the importation of many thousands of slaves
from Africa to work the plantations. The various ports and settlements fight proxy wars for the
powers - it is a lawless, dangerous region.

Elsewhere in the world, the colonies on the east coast of North America are thriving but are still
secondary in importance to the more established colonies in the south. Trade with the East is
expanding quickly and the foundations for the European empires of the coming centuries are
being laid. The globe is being explored - the Australian continent has been discovered and better
charts are being made. Navigation is still something of an art, not a science. While methods for
discovering one's longitude (north/south location) are well known (relying on taking sightings
of the horizon and the sun or stars), correct measurement of latitude is not yet possible and will
not be until more accurate clocks are made.

The Reformation is still a major factor in European politics. Spain and France are Catholic;
England and the Netherlands are Protestant. Religious civil wars regularly tear the continent
apart.

Spain is the most established of the great powers in the Caribbean but its fortunes in Europe
are waning. Its ports are the oldest and best fortified but are only lightly protected. Their Dutch
rivals are wealthy but the Netherlands have few holdings in the Caribbean and their attention
is mainly focussed on trade with the East. England and France are both expansionist powers,
establishing new colonies and sending more ships into the region.


Buccaneers and Privateers
Early Spanish settlers had let pigs and other animals run wild on many of the islands of the
Caribbean. In the mid-1600s, bands of sailors, thieves, rogues and vagabonds take to living on
these pigs, cooking their flesh in barbeques called boucans. The Spanish authorities drive the
buccaneers away from the settled parts of Hispaniola and the other islands, earning the enmity
of the rogues. The buccaneers raid Spanish ports in retaliation, stealing and looting. The lawless
buccaneers are a ready source of men for treasurer hunters and piracy. They are also masters of
the lawless port of Tortuga.

In 1668-1671, one of the most famous of the buccaneers, the Welshman Henry Morgan,
leads several major attacks on the Spanish towns of Portobello and Panama. He carries away
a considerable fortune and does such damage to Spanish interests in the Caribbean that he is
rewarded with the governorship of Port Royal on Jamaica.

Technically, Morgan and many of his compatriots are privateers, not pirates. The distinction is
a subtle one - a privateer sails and fights under a letter of marque granted by some governor,
representing one of the powers. Henry Morgan got his commission from the English Governor
of Jamaica, which legally authorised him to make war on the Spanish ports he attacked. He is
effectively a mercenary, not a criminal, at least under English law. The Spanish would hang him
as a thief if they catch him. The practise of privateering waxes and wanes depending on events
in Europe - when Spain goes to war with England, then every pirate in the Caribbean will sign
up with one side or the other, so they can loot ships and sell their prizes legally in the port of the
opposing side. When the war ends, the privateers may promise to become law-abiding traders
but the lure of piracy and the freedom of the seas is often too strong.


The Golden Age of Piracy
The period known as the Golden Age of Piracy lasts roughly from the sacking of Panama in
1671 to the 1720s, when Woodes Rogers' offer of the pardon to the pirates of Nassau Port is
largely accepted. The rise of the British Navy's pirate-hunting efforts are largely responsible for
the decline of the pirates.

During the golden age, there are hundreds of pirate attacks on ships in the Caribbean. In any
given year, there are four or five notorious pirate captains at large. A captain might be active for
a few years before retiring to live off his ill-gotten gains, or when he is caught and tried. Most
captains are traders or even soldiers who went rogue and turned to piracy.

The piratical lifestyle is appealing to many sailors, who work in very harsh conditions for little
pay. Instead of being one of ten sailors on a cargo ship, risking life and limb for a few schillings
and watching your masters back in Europe reap the huge financial rewards of a successful voyage,
you could join a pirate ship. With so many crew on board a pirate ship, there is much less work
and the promise of vast rewards. The pirates are lazy, drunk, undisciplined and often delighted
in their viciousness and depravity but their ways are undeniably alluring. Many crews willingly
follow their captain when he turns pirate, so long as he keeps bringing down prizes.


The Caribbean
The buccaneer port of Tortuga is the metaphorical and geographical heart of the pirate Caribbean.
This lawless town is located on the north coast of the great island of Hispaniola. The island itself
is, as of 1697, divided into two sections. The western section is St. Domingue and is owned by
the French, who are allies to the buccaneers. St. Domingue is known for its sugar plantations
and many now-respectable and wealthy landowners here are actually former buccaneers. The east
side of the island, Santo Domingo, is still Spanish but has been so ravaged by pirate raids that it
is now very poor and of little importance.

To the west of Hispaniola is Cuba, the major Spanish holding in the Caribbean. It is a wealthy
island, with many rich plantations. The fortress of El Morro is the centre of the Spanish military
forces, while the capital of Havana is the place to trade goods. In the Caribbean, the Spanish
also hold Porto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago and once held Jamaica. Porto Rico is poor but well-
fortified and is used by the Spanish navy as a base. Trinidad is a troubled colony, prone to
violence, but it is better than its neighbour Tobago, which has been plunged into near-anarchy
by repeated wars and invasions.

In the west, in South America, Spain has several other colonies. The famous Treasure Fleets bring
the wealth of these colonies, especially silver and gold, through the Caribbean en route to Spain.

The English seized Jamaica from the Spanish in 1655 and the island has prospered as a source
of sugar. They also hold many of the islands in the north of the Caribbean, from the treacherous
shoals of the Bahamas to many of the Virgin and Leeward Islands, as well as the Cayman Islands.
The Bahamas (especially Nassau Port in New Providence, home of the infamous Blackbeard)
and Caymans are more pirate haunts than English but St. Kitts, Barbados, Nevis and Montserrat
are all thriving.

The French holdings in the Caribbean are more tenuous. They share St. Kitt's with the English,
St. Martin's with the Dutch and Hispaniola with the Spanish. They also have the spice island of
Grenada and the prosperous colonies on Guadeloupe and Martinique.

Finally, the Dutch claim many of the other islands in the Caribbean but all too often these are
used as pirate bases. The main Dutch trade town of Willemstad, rivalling Havana in importance,
is on Curacao.


Techniques
Research: Between the internet and the library, there is a wealth of information on piracy out
there, which will give plenty of ideas for adventures. Gather as much information as you can
and encourage the players to immerse themselves too (alternatively, have the Adventurers live
sheltered lives or suffer from amnesia, so they can learn about the historical setting in-character).

Handouts: Research will give rise to plenty of documents and texts from the era of piracy
and players love handouts. Descriptions of famous pirates, geographical treatises on the islands,
copies of laws and treaties - print them out and tack them up around the gaming area. Use copies
of maps from the era instead of modern maps.

Do not Sweat The Details: While keeping close to the historical ideals is necessary for this style
of play, actually having fun and playing a game is even more important. The Games Master
should never let the game stop because of some historical inconsistency. If two players are
arguing over exactly what sort of rigging was in common use in 1720, get them to postpone the
discussion until after the game and move onto plundering ships. The aim of historical campaigns
is to explore history through a game and the game should come first.

Campaign Ideas:
Shipwrecked: The game begins with the Adventurers being cast up on a desert island following
a terrible storm that destroyed several ships in a convoy. The Adventurers are the only survivors.
They have to survive on the island for some time, until a pirate vessel arrives on the island to
careen. The only way off the island is to sign up with the pirates.

Pirate Hunters: Another option is to cast the players as naval officers, in pursuit of pirates. Give
them the bare minimum of resources (an armed sloop and a crew of sullen sailors who are already
grumbling and mutinous) and pit them against historical pirates. Can the players do better than
real-world pirate hunters? The Games Master can just consult history books for the actions and
strengths of the various notable pirates.


Cinematic Piracy
A cinematic game covers much the same ground as a historical campaign but takes the best bits
instead of holding itself to actual history. Pirates were the pulp villains of their day and pirate
movies invariably involve swashbuckling, dramatic rescues and duels, good-hearted rogues or
monstrous foes, castles on crumbling cliffs, massive battles at sea and piles of gold and jewels.
In short, cinematic games should ooze coolness and drama. At the same time, a large part of the
appeal of a pirate game is the setting, so the Games Master should always emphasise and cherish
the classic elements of piracy.

In a cinematic game, emotion and character are far more important than treasure. An Adventurer
should not become a pirate just to steal gold - there should always be some other reason for
turning pirate. Perhaps he wants revenge on all civilisation, a la Captain Nemo; perhaps some
diabolical relative has framed him for a terrible crime and he has to hide among the outlaws until
he can reclaim his fortune; perhaps some noble woman is rebelling against an arranged marriage
and intends to humiliate her intended husband by defeating his naval vessel.

One trick is to ensure that each Adventurer is linked to at least one other Adventurer. Adventurer
A might be the old shipmate of Adventurer B; Adventurer B might be lusting after young Miss
C; Adventurer D is secretly C's old uncle, who ran away to sea as a young man and turned pirate.
In this way, even if each Adventurer has their own dramatic tale unfolding, the various stories
cross over and allow the Adventurers to act as a group. This also opens up a scope for betrayal -
pirates are thieves, after all, and unexpected reversals when your old shipmate turns on you are
par for the course.


Techniques
Think Cinema: Frame scenes and situations as if your game was a big-budget movie. Always
leap into conflict (whether it is an argument, an important decision or a swordfight) as soon
as possible. Reflect the mood of a scene in the surroundings and the weather - storms signify
trouble, rainstorms despair, sunshine joy and so forth.

Get Personal: Tie everything into the Adventurers. A villain should never just be a bad guy - he
should be related to the Adventurers or have some other prior connection to them. Try to evoke
emotion as much as possible and throw Hero Points around for dramatic speeches and cool ideas.


Campaign Ideas
The Treasure Map: Treasure Island did it first but it is a classic for a reason. A band of pirates
(say, Henry Morgan's buccaneers) bury a vast treasure. They draw a map describing its location,
then divide the map up between them. The Adventurers have inherited or otherwise obtained
a few parts of the map. You need the whole map to find the treasure (there is no X marking the
spot; the location of the treasure is determined by drawing lines between various landmarks).
The first part of the campaign involves the Adventurers searching for the other sections of the
map, which are scattered over the whole Caribbean in the hands of former pirates; the second
part involves finding the mysterious island, reconstructing the map and recovering the treasure
(optionally - the mysterious island is home to hostile natives, or ancient ruins, or a giant gorilla,
or dinosaurs).

Revenge!: The Adventurers were once passengers on a ship that was attacked by a notorious
pirate. They survived but everything they owned and loved was taken from them. Now, they have
banded together for revenge - only to discover that their old nemesis took a pardon from the
Spanish king and is now a wealthy and respected plantation owner (he is still secretly sponsoring
pirate attacks, of course). The Adventurers have to battle their foe's minions and expose his pirate
connections to the Spanish court, before a final confrontation in the villain's castle.

Libertalia!: Some sources (like A General History of Pyrates) claim that a free pirate nation called
Libertalia was founded by a renegade French captain named Mission. Stealing a Dutch slave
ship, he and his crew declared themselves in opposition to all the powers and states of Europe,
as well as the Church. All men were equal; all goods would be held in common. Driven by these
beliefs and by the white flag of liberty, they colonised a part of northern Madagascar.

While there were certainly pirate hideouts in Madagascar, it is unlikely that any were as organised
as Libertalia was supposed to be. The idea of a pirate nation is great for gaming however - just
transplant Libertalia to the Caribbean and give the Adventurers a great home base to sail from!


Supernatural Piracy
Supernatural elements can be added to either a cinematic or historical pirate game. A little bit
of weirdness can fit nicely into either style of game, while a whole lot of weirdness moves your
campaign into the field of alternate history or outright fantasy. No matter what supernatural
elements you add, the essential core of piracy has to be maintained. There have to be empires
and colonies trading in the Caribbean and there have to be wild, cruel men on ships raiding
and stealing from these empires. There has to be something valuable sought by those empires,
something that drew people to these warm seas.

Pirates and Ghosts: Tales of ghost ships and spectral pirates are classics of the genre and there
are numerous ways to incorporate them. One subtle way is to have a ghost appear to only one of
the Adventurers, a mysterious spectre who is guarding him or guiding him to a particular destiny.
Pirates live violent, dangerous lives and there is plenty of opportunity for a violent death to give
rise to a ghost. Perhaps a ghost is trying to ensure that the Adventurers eventually track down and
kill the pirate who murdered him in the first place.

Alternatively, what if going on the account opens the Adventurers' eyes to the spirit world?
What if all those symbols of death and mortality associated with pirates had a deeper, occult
meaning? Perhaps every pirate vessel had its own cloud of angry, vengeful ghosts trailing after it.
Captains might interrogate ghosts for intelligence about other ships and trade routes. Certain
ghosts might be especially sought after - the spectre of a particularly talented navigator would be
a treasure worth killing for. Piracy could be the new form of necromancy...

Pirates and Voodoo: The vodun religion was carried from West Africa to the Caribbean by slaves
and soon acquired many followers among escaped slaves and on the islands. There were many
escaped slaves among the pirates, who lived at the fringes of society, so it is possible that they
learned something of the loa spirits and how to placate and command them. In this game, the
Loa are powerful spirits who can be tapped for power if you know what rites and gifts to offer
them.

While some practitioners of vodun are careful and respectful when dealing with the Loa, pirates
take a more direct approach. With blades of cold iron quenched in stolen holy water, they go to
the places where the spirit world encroaches onto the real world, to islands that appear only at the
darkest hours of the night, to haunted crossroads sacred to Legba, to steaming jungles where the
trees speak with old voices out of Africa. There, they attack the loa until they submit, enslaving
them to serve the pirates.


Tim Powers is the absolute master of this type of alternate-history game and his book, On
Stranger Tides, mixes excellent pirate adventure with voodoo and Greek myth.


Minor Loa
The Loa are spirits (see Monsters of Legend). A minor loa is described here - this particular one
holds authority over storms and foul weather.

If placated or defeated, the spirit can be bound to a pirate. As this particular Loa is a storm-spirit,
then the pirate who commands it could gain one of the following abilities:
•	     Summon a storm once per month
•	     Ignore the penalties to Shiphandling
•	     Channel the force of the storm, allowing him to cast the Skybolt spell.


Pirates and Clockwork: In the year 955 AH, Taqi al-Din Mohammed ibn Ma'ruf (peace
be upon him) started the Great Observatory of Istanbul and ushered in a golden age of
scientific and technological innovation within the Sublime Ottoman State. One year after
the construction of the Great Observatory, a fisherman in Cyprus discovered a strange
machine that was brought to al-Din for study. Ottoman scientists reworked the device into
an effective tool for mapmaking and navigation, while other tinkers used the principles
behind the device's operation to process census data, plan crop rotations and provision
armies. Sultan Murad III was so enamoured by the devices that he sent out a fleet of specially-
equipped ships to map the seven seas for the glory of Allah and the Sublime Ottoman State.

This brief flowering of technology ended in the year 958 AH, when al-Din's calculations
showed that, despite the sighting of a comet seen by the soothsayers of Sultan Murad


III, his armies would not prevail against a smaller but better-prepared Persian army. The
Great Observatory was destroyed and the exploratory fleet's crews denied return to port.

Many of the ships made their way to Europe, where their crews were promptly detained and
interrogated. The French were the first to openly accept the exiles, with la vie Sufisme informing
discussion in the salons of the wealthy and French merchant ships receiving accurate maps of
the Mediterranean and North African coasts. The other great powers followed suit, building
their own 'Hajji Devices' for their own use. These devices, and the maps they generated, were
well-kept state secrets, allowing easy access to the wealth of the New World and the Indies...

... until a French ship's captain named Mission disappeared with a Hajji device and, a few
months later, the first 'Libertatian Gazetteer' appeared in the sailor's taverns of Marseilles,
providing full access to the trade routes of the Great Powers and their tame merchant houses.

Thirty years later, the Spanish Main bears the marks of all of these influences. Freebooters sailing
under the flag of Libertatia trade booty for Hajji codes with artificers in the free city of Port o'
Clocks, while Sufee Levellers from the Republic of Rhode Island open safe harbours and open
markets throughout the New World. Buccaneers speak with dread of the Scylla, a Hajji Machine
set to watch over the treacherous bay of Cartagena, while Jesuit artificers work towards a day
when the machines will perfectly reflect every aspect of God's creation.

In this setting, ancient Greek clockworks have been developed by the Ottomans and later by
Europe, giving rise to a world of brass computers and clockwork cyberpunk. A pirate might steal
the navigational data for a merchant ship and feed it into his brig's onboard Hajji Machine (or
hasher, as pirate argot has it), allowing him to sail precisely to the location of the merchant and
intercept it. When within range, remorseless and terrible engines give precise firing solutions to
the banks of cannons...


Clockwork Equipment
Hajji Device: This is the most common form of clockwork computer, used for navigation. The
Hajji device is a heavy contraption of brass wheels, lodestones and glass dials, roughly the size
of a buckler shield. A ship's destination and course are input as numbers and the Hajji device
automatically calculates the ship's course. A clever operator can sail to any point on the surface
of the globe by correctly programming these machines.

Calculating Engine: Calculating engines are made from rank upon rank of Hajji devices. They
are powered by hand-cranks or treadmills, although it is said that the English have developed a
steam-powered machine that runs far quicker than any other engine. A calculating engine can do
mathematics at great speed and with perfect accuracy. In battle, calculating engines are used to
provide firing solutions (giving a bonus to Gunnery tests - an average calculating engine gives a
bonus of +20% to hit and more powerful military models can give up to +75% to hit).

Other calculating engines are used to produce the secret books of codes and logs that are vital for
navigation with Hajji devices.


Brazen Head: A curiosity, Brazen Heads are small but very clever calculating engines. They
speak using an intricate series of valves and bellows, and can hold discourse on a variety of topics.
These Machine Intellects are no more than amusing toys in the eyes of most people, with no
more true intelligence than a parrot or an Irishman - but those who listen to the advice of this
clacking automata can sometimes learn strange secrets...

Clockwork Hand: Hook hands and peg-legs are a thing of the past! While no artificer has
managed to create a living automaton, they can make replacement limbs and even clockwork
hands that function almost as well as the real thing, so long as they are wound regularly.

Pirates and Dragons: The jungles of South America held a terrible secret - the true rulers of
the Aztec empire were the dragons. These terrible lizards squatted atop stepped pyramids and
demanded gold and bloody sacrifices from their followers. Cortez and his conquistadors turned
dragon-slayer and, after many decades of war, the Dragon Empire was toppled and all the great
wyrms were slain.

A few eggs survived however and they can be hatched through alchemical means. Dragons take
many centuries to grow to full size but beasts as large as small ships are not unheard of even in
this day and age. Some dragons are owned by various nobles, others are used as weapons by
the navy. Some have even fallen into the hands of pirates - even a small dragon can destroy a
prize's rigging, paralysing the merchant ship and allowing the pirates to catch it easily. Dragons
instinctively crave gold and pirates who fail to find enough coin to keep their dragon happy can
find their secret weapon turn on them.

There are rumours, of course, of an elder dragon that fled the dragonslayers and took refuge
somewhere in the Caribbean...

Optionally for this campaign, the dragons are the highly evolved descendants of the dinosaurs,
who somehow survived the asteroid impact that wiped the rest out. Speaking of which,
the Caribbean is one possible location for the lost city of Atlantis. Pirates with Altantean
supertechnology powered by meteor shards, anyone?


Otherworldly Piracy
Players of traditional Legend campaigns may wish to integrate piracy into their fantasy games.
Fantasy worlds rarely include gunpowder - this can be replaced by magic, or just dropped entirely.
Pirates can capture prizes through boarding actions and with bows instead of with cannon-fire.

Finally, it might also be necessary to adjust the prices for treasures to something more reasonable
- most fantasy worlds have a lot more gold and jewels than the Caribbean, so the cost of treasure
should be reduced significantly.

One nice thing about a Pirates of Legend game is that you can start it as a historical pirate game,
then suddenly spin the characters off into utmost strangeness.


Scurvy Dogs and Other Rogues
A miscellanea of generic Non-Player Characters...


Pirate, Scurvy Dog
This is the average pirate in a poor crew - a penniless buccaneer, a newly recruited pirate or a
thug in a port.
