### What this Book Contains
Welcome to Vikings of Legend, a historical source book concerning the Northmen, their
myths, magic and monsters. Contained within these covers are all the basic rules and
information needed to set a Legend campaign in the Viking period.

Whilst a considerable amount of space is dedicated to the history and society of the Viking
age, this book is merely a broad overview of these powerful and fascinating peoples. To
make this unique culture more accessible, the information included within is fairly generic
and perhaps anachronistic considering the length of time the Viking age spans.

Included are in-depth descriptions of Viking society, religious belief, magic, supernatural
creatures and so on. Vikings of Legend is designed to be the basis for not just historical games
but ones of fantasy or myth too, where heroic Adventurers can fight by the side of their gods,
travel to the other worlds and have divine gifts passed down to them by their fathers.

Games Masters are encouraged to use this book as a springboard to dive deeper into
the history and culture of the Northmen, so that they can be captivated by the sagas or
explore the deeper complexities of Viking religion and government.

The ideas presented here are simply guidelines. Feel free to change what you will,
ignore rules, modify history. As always Your Legend May Vary. Now grab your Dane

The Vikings were a vibrant, often violent culture, which exploded from Scandinavia
after the Migration Period of the Dark Ages. A dynamic, sea based people, they spread
across the Baltic into modern day Russia, down to Byzantium and the Middle East,
conquered the northern coast of France, settled the eastern regions of England and
Scotland, took over the Scottish and north Atlantic Isles and colonised Iceland and
Greenland.

Whilst primarily farmers and traders, the Vikings are best remembered as warlike
raiders, which gave rise to their name. The word Viking probably originated from 'vik'
the Scandinavian for bay, a suitable word for a sea faring culture; but by the end of the
period the word was synonymous with 'pirate'.

Traditionally, the Viking Age spans from the year 793 when raiders sacked Lindisfane,
to the year 1066 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Somewhat of a simplification, the
Vikings had been exploring long before their savage attack on a monastery brought
them infamy in the pages of their contemporary historians. Raiding probably only
followed once trade links had been established; accumulated wealth making such
dangerous ventures worthwhile.

The Vikings themselves were a surprisingly homogenous culture bound by common
language and extensive trade links. They lived along the coasts and rivers of Norway,
Denmark and Sweden, wherever a ship could venture. However, despite a common
kinship, they were still a loose collection of feuding tribes ruled by elected chieftains,
often warring with one another or suffering internal anarchy.

Viking lands were not highly populated; most of Norway and Sweden especially were
regions of inhospitable mountains or impenetrable forest. Clearing such land to plant
crops took generations of back breaking work to excavate roots and stone from the soil
and slowly nurture it to be able to support crops. Further north the deeper forests were
frightening places jealously guarded by the Lapp tribes.

With the slow onset of stability, the population began to grow as petty kingdoms formed
and merged. What cleared land existed was already settled, so young men not destined
to inherit were faced with the choice of clearing their own land, earning enough wealth
to purchase already productive steads, or sailing overseas to settle easier terrain. Since
personal reputation was based on land ownership and warrior prowess, many took to
the sea to build their status. Others simply fled their homelands as criminal outcastes
or to escape political persecution.

Thus began a period of fear and terror for the coastal regions of Europe.


## A Historical Overview
The greatest strength of the Vikings was their ships. Arguably the most advanced
sailing vessels built during that period, their design allowed the Vikings to sail very
long distances, with a greater degree of safety if facing rough weather.

Reliable sea transport allowed the Vikings to engage in widespread trade. Initially this
was along the coast of Scandinavia and across the Baltic Sea where the central islands
of Gotland and Örland became well populated trade centres.

The Danish and Norwegian Vikings turned their attention westwards. The ships that
had initially helped to spread Viking culture along the coasts, allowed them to safely
cross the North Sea, where the kingdoms of Britain lay unsuspecting of the looming
danger.

The Norwegians expanded into Scotland and Ireland, ultimately colonising Iceland
and Greenland. The Danes concentrated their efforts further south, eventually settling
in the Danelaw (northern and eastern England) and Normandy in France after a series
of raids that grew ever larger and more destructive, forcing the local rulers to pay off
the invaders.

Slightly less aggressive than their brethren, the Swedish Vikings became more focussed
on trade and exploration of the East, travelling deep into Russia and south along the
Dneiper and Volga towards Byzantium.


### The Vikings' First Contact with Britain and Ireland
During the eighth century the seven British Kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, East
Anglia, Wessex, Essex, Sussex and Kent were well settled and converted to Christianity.
Mercia in ascendance over the other kingdoms under the powerful warrior King Offa,
enabled some degree of stability that allowed a rise in wealth and goods.

In 789 three Norwegian Viking ships arrived in Wessex, landing at the small settlement
of Portland. The reeve of King Beorhtric rode to meet the strangers, assuming they were
traders and requested they accompany him to the villa of the Wessex King; whereupon
the reeve and his men were slain. This was the first recorded instance of conflict with
the Vikings and what provoked the attack is unknown.

The exploratory voyages were obviously scouting missions for land or plunder, for the
next incidence of their presence was the inconceivable assault on the monastery of
Lindesfarne. In 793 after many omens of high winds, lightning and fiery dragons in
the sky, Viking raiders destroyed the holy place, looting its accumulated treasures and
killing all the priests. No one had dared profane the sanctity of the island for almost
350 years and the shock was profound.

This was merely the beginning however. The following year in 794 another
Northumbrian monastery, Jarrow, was attacked but the raiders were thwarted. More
assaults occurred along the coast and up navigable rivers, becoming an almost yearly
occurrence. The holy island of Iona was even raided three times in one decade. A total
of 25 monastic raids were recorded in a period of 34 years.

Nowhere was particularly safe. Raiding spread around the capes of Scotland, the
Western Isles falling into Viking hands and reached as far as Ireland. Between 830 and
845 raids on religious centres became severe, the annals recording over 50 attacks, nine
of which spread to pillage large areas. Monasteries and large churches seemed to have
been the main targets of these raids, presumably because of the prevalence of valuable
objects and hostages located within them.

In 841 as part of a systematic plundering of Ireland, the Vikings built a series of
fortifications, including one in Dublin. Overwintering in their longphoirts, they began
building permanent settlements, which could act as a secure base for further invasions
inland. The local Irish kings were too involved with their own bickering to put up a
united defence, leaving the Vikings to plunder at will and briefly forced the Irish to
become tributaries. Once they realised the danger they faced, the Irish kings began to
fight back, winning some significant victories, but it was too little too late. The Vikings
held onto their coastal settlements, managing to form their own petty kingdoms and
marrying into the local population. Their presence grudgingly accepted, the Vikings
acted as mercenaries for the Irish kings.

Infighting between the Vikings occurred in 849 when a fleet of 120 ships arrived in
Ireland to subjugate the Vikings already settled there. Two years later another Danish
invasion was beaten off by the Irish Vikings.

Then in 853 the Norwegian Viking Olaf the White came to extract tribute from the
entirety of Ireland and along with his brothers Imar and Auisle became prominent
leaders of Dublin. Things seemed to quiet down for a period until 866 before he left
to overrun Pictland and continued onward to Strathclyde, returning to Dublin in 870
with 200 ships, a vast treasure and large numbers of captives.

After this came a gradual decline in the power of the Irish Vikings, their longphoirts
were destroyed one-by-one; although plenty of independent Viking raids continued to
plunder the hinterlands. Eventually however, the leadership of Dublin became divided
and Viking forces split into two factions under Sitric, a son of Imar and Earl Sigfrith.
Sitric was killed in 896 during the dynastic feud.

In this weakened state, the Vikings could not resist the combined forces of the Irish
kingdoms of Brega and Leinster who drove the pagans out of Ireland in 902, sorely
wounded and forced to abandon many ships.


### The Danish Conquest of Britain
By 865 the Danes began to settle in Britain. An invasion led by the brothers Halfdan
and Ivar the Boneless arrived in East Anglia and demanded tribute from King Edmund
in exchange for peace. A deal was wrought that allowed the Danes to overwinter in the
kingdom before venturing north to attack the Kingdom of Northumbria, which was
suffering a civil war between its deposed King Osberht and his usurper Ælla.

York fell to the invaders in 866 and was sacked and burned. Afterwards the town
was renamed as Jorvik and became the Danish capital in Britain. The following year
Osberht and Æella formed an alliance against the Danes but were killed in battle
and the Vikings marched south. Alarmed by this outcome Æthelred, King of Wessex
summoned his army against the Vikings, who remained safe behind fortifications
in Nottingham and refused to fight. Fearing yet more devastation, King Burgred of
Mercia ceded part of his kingdom to the Danes in exchange for a permanent peace
between them.

Flushed with their success, in 869 Ivar the Boneless demanded further tribute from
King Edmund of Anglia. The king refused, so the next year Ivar returned with an
army and defeated Edmund at Hoxne. He sacrificed the king to Odin in the 'blood
eagle' ritual, adding East Anglia to the Danish conquests of Northumbria and parts of
Mercia.

Dreading the subjugation of the whole of Britain, King Æthelred and his brother Alfred
rushed to stop the Danes at Reading but were defeated with heavy losses. Retreating
back to Ashdown, the Danes pursued the Wessex army and engaged them a final time
in early January 871. Whilst Æthelred prayed in his tent, Alfred led the army and
defeated the Danes, killing five of their leading Jarls. Further skirmishing between the
forces led to Æthelred's death and Alfred inherited the throne.

Facing overwhelming odds with the landing of a second Danish army in Britain, Alfred
undertook a style of guerrilla warfare but had to pay off the Danes to gain respite for
his troops. The Danes took this opportunity to turn north and finish off Mercia. King
Burgred fought for three years in vain, eventually forced to flee to Rome in 874 when
his kingdom finally fell. Ivar the Boneless died during the campaign and was succeeded
by Guthrum the Old.

In 875 the Danes settled in Dorsetshire, within the borders of Wessex. Unable to react,
Alfred sued for peace, which the Danes treacherously broke the following year capturing
Wareham and then Exeter in 877. Forced to react, Alfred laid siege to the Danes who
patiently awaited relief from reinforcements sailing from Scandinavia. Unfortunately
most of the fleet, over 100 ships, was sunk during a storm and the Danes retreated
northwards back to Mercia.

The year of 878 finally saw the turn of fate against the Danes. Guthram the Old
manoeuvred his forces to pin Alfred in his winter quarters, whilst a second Danish
army landed in Wales to cut off his escape. This second force was defeated by an inferior
number of Saxons, led by a Wessex ealdorman named Odda, who launched an attack
whilst the Danes slept. Freed from this threat, Alfred was able to defeat the main army
of Guthram's Danes, pursuing them back to Chippenham where they surrendered.

Forced to renounce paganism and be baptised as a Christian, Guthram retired to
East Anglia. Six years later in 884 he attacked the Kingdom of Kent but was defeated
soundly and lost many of the lands that had been won previously. In order to promote
peace, King Alfred established the borders of Danish territory, forming the Danelaw –
the region extending over the north and east of Britain, roughly along a line between
London and Chester, within which the Danes had self-rule.

The peace brought by the Danelaw lasted until 903. Æthelwald, the eldest son of
Æthelred, angered by his failure to seize the throne of Wessex, sought refuge with the
Danes of Northumbria. Seeking some way to regain power he travelled south to East
Anglia, where he incited the local Danes to break the peace treaty and attack his cousin
King Edward the Elder of Wessex.

After ravaging Mercia, Æthelwald and the Danes retired to East Anglia but were chased
by Edward and his combined army. Although the Danes managed to ambush the
Kentish contingent, a great mutual slaughter ensued, which led to the deaths of both
Æthelwald and the Danish King Eohric.

This setback persuaded the Danes to desist their aggression until 911 when the
Northumbrian Danes wrought havoc on Mercia for a second time, only to be defeated
by King Edward of Wessex and Ealdorman Æthelred of Mercia at the Battle of Tettenhall.

Attracted by its wealth, in 919 an expedition of Norwegian Vikings led by King Rægnold
of Dublin attacked and took Jorvik, displacing Danish authority. The following year
King Edward of Wessex and Mercia, already suzerain lord of Essex and East Anglia,
was accepted as overlord by the Norse, Scots and Welsh – indicating that the Danelaw
was already faltering as an independent nation. He died in 924 and passed on the
combined kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex to his son Æthelstan, who in turn, after
bringing Northumbria back under Saxon control, was declared totius rex Brittanniae,
or Lord of all Britain, and was succeeded by his son Edmund in 939.

The young British King soon lost control of Northumbria, the Five Boroughs and
parts of Mercia, so that in 941, the inhabitants of Jorvik chose King Olaf Sigtryggsson
of Dublin as their co-ruler. Angered by their breaking of faith, Edmund immediately
re-captured the Five Boroughs and Mercia during 942 and resisted a series of raids by
Olaf until 944 whereupon the two foes formed an alliance and Olaf was baptised, then
later deposed as king.

Edmund died several years later, acceded by his son Eadred whose authoritarian
domination of Northumberland caused the Danes to violate their oaths, electing Eirik
Blood-Axe as their new king. To punish their disloyalty, Eadred raided the Danelaw
inflicting much destruction. Although beaten back at the Battle of Castleford, Eadred's
threats convinced the fickle Northumbrians to renounce Eirik and pay compensation.

Never a Viking to stay down, Eirik returned to rule Northumbria in 952, this time
reigning for two years. He was eventually expelled by his own people in 954. The
Danelaw finally fell under permanent Saxon rule, temporarily ending any prospect of
an independent Viking kingdom in Britain.


### The Norwegian Re-conquest of Ireland
Driven from Dublin in 902, the Viking exiles settled much of the Western Isles of
Scotland and took up fighting against the Picts; forgetting their previous hold on Ireland.

The brief respite of the Irish ended in 914 when a great sea fleet of pagans landed at
Waterford and erected a winter camp. The following year, more Vikings arrived and the
combined force proceeded to ravage the kingdom and churches of Munster.

In 917 two exiles, Ragnall and his Kinsman Sitric arrived back in Ireland and took
over control. Sitric fought a battle against an army of Leinstermen, killing the King
and Bishop of Leinster, which allowed him to retake Dublin. Ragnall, failing to win
anything in Ireland, took his Waterford fleet to northern Britain and fought a series
of campaigns, which resulted in his Kingship of both Jorvik and Northumberland,
binding the two under a single dynasty.

Niall, King of Tara marched on Dublin in 919 but fell at the Battle of Islandbridge
along with a great many other Irish leaders. Several years later Sitric left Dublin to
claim the throne of Jorvik when Ragnall died, ruling it for six years from 921 to 927.

Dublin was left in the hands of Godfrid a notorious raider and slaver, who initiated
half a decade of severe raids in an attempt to conquer the lands of Armagh. He was
thwarted by the valiant defence of King Muirchertach of Ui Neill.

When Sitric died leaving Northumbria in the hands of Æthelstan, Godfrid foolishly
hurried to claim Jorvik, leaving Dublin unsupervised. In his absence Tomar mac Ailche,
the powerful Viking lord of Limerick, which he had conquered in 922, negotiated
with Godfrid's enemies and briefly took Dublin – precipitating a long term Dublin-
Limerick struggle when Godfrid returned, finally driven off by the people of Jorvik.
When he died in 934 Godfrid was remembered as a 'most cruel king of the Norsemen'.

His son, Olaf Guthfrithsson, ultimately dealt with Limerick in 937, destroying its fleet
and bringing back its leader as a captive to Dublin. He left for Jorvik in 939 and died
two years later, the King of Jorvik, Northumbria, Danish Mercia, Dublin and wielded
power over Scotland and the Isles.

His successor Olaf Sigtryggsson briefly ruled as King of Jorvik but was expelled in a
coup led by Wulfstan, Archbishop of York. Returning to Ireland he found the war
between the Irish and Vikings had worsened. Dublin was sacked by King Congalach of
Brega and King Broen of Leinster. The destruction was total, every ship and building
burned, the warriors were killed, women and children enslaved. Only a quarter of the
population survived the massacre by fleeing in boats.

For his success Congalach was made King of Tara. Olaf was offered an alliance and
granted rule over Dublin. Together they fought a series of battles against Ruaidri ua
Canannain, a rival for High Kingship of Ireland. When their combined forces were
defeated at the Battle of Slane in 947, Olaf lost his kingship of Dublin and returned
to Jorvik in 949 where he ruled briefly until 952 when Eirik Blood-Axe replaced him.

From 950-980 Dublin acted as a typical petty kingdom involving itself in Irish politics.
During this period Olaf Sigtryggsson fought many battles in and against an endless
succession of raids. However, in 980 he lost a disastrous battle at Tara, which ended in a
'red slaughter' for the unified Dublin and Hebridean army. Although several Irish kings
died, Olaf's son Ragnall also fell and Dublin was forced to pay a heavy tribute to King Mael
Sechnaill of Ui Neill. Olaf abdicated his authority and retired to the Island of Mona.


### The Irish Struggle against the Vikings
In 999 the up and coming King of Munster, Brian Boruma mac Cennetig, laid siege
to the city of Dublin, which was then ruled by Sigtrygg Silkbeard. Aided by his Irish
cousin, Mael Morda King of Leinster, the Viking decided to meet Brian's forces in
the field. The battle was fierce, lasting the entire day and resulted in the loss of 4,000
Leinstermen and Vikings.

With no defenders remaining, Dublin was sacked again but Brian decided to reinstate
Sigtrygg as King, granting the Viking one of his daughters in marriage. Calling upon
his new vassal, the next year Brian led a combined Munster, Leinster and Dublin army
against the High King Mael Sechnaill. Although the offensive was defeated by the
cunning construction of two bridges, which prevented Brian's Viking ships from using
the River Shannon, the High King eventually surrendered his title in 1002.

Over the following decade Brian assumed the High Kingship in practice as well as
name. The Viking troops under his authority fought against the province of Ulster,
which refused to acknowledge his authority, using their naval skills to launch sea based
attacks, which the Ulstermen could not block.

In 1013 the disgruntled Mael Morda, King of Leinster, insulted by a member of the
High King's family, rose in revolt. In retaliation the southern half of Leinster was
ravaged by an army from Muster under the command of Murchad, one of Brian's
sons. Joining his father their combined forces laid siege to Dublin. However, the High
King's army ran out of supplies first and was forced to abandon the blockade in late
December.

Mael Morda realising that Brian would return in the spring, sent his cousin Sigtrygg
King of Dublin to fetch troops from outside of Ireland. He sailed to Orkney and the
Isle of Man, gathering the support of Viking mercenaries willing to fight for loot.

Brian gathered a large army comprised of the men of Munster, Southern Connacht
and Meath. Overconfident with his superiority of numbers, he sent a large mounted
detachment to raid southern Leinster in order to cause the Leinster troops to desert
to defend their homes. All would have been well, save for an argument with Mael
Sechnaill mac Domnaill, causing the King of Meath to withdraw with all of his men.

Fatefully, Sigurd Hlodvirsson Earl of Orkney and Brodir of the Isle of Man arrived
not long after with the promised reinforcements for Sigtrygg. In the resulting Battle
of Clontarf, Brian was killed but almost all of the Viking mercenaries and their leaders
also fell.

With their warriors slain, the Dublin Vikings ceased to be a political force. Sigtrygg
who had garrisoned the city during the battle, remained King of Dublin until his
death in 1042. Lacking any form of power in Ireland, the Vikings instead turned to
conquests in England and Scotland once Cnut became king in 1016.


### The Norsemen of the Atlantic
The ships of the Vikings allowed the Norse to cross the rough and turbulent seas of the
North Atlantic. Rowing and sailing, they could reach remote islands, some of which,
like the Shetlands and Orkneys, had been inhabited since Neolithic times. Other
islands such as the Faeroes and Iceland itself were simply remote and uninhabited save
for Christian hermits seeking isolation.

Many Vikings settled the occupied islands, marrying into the local population and
helping to weave the isles into their trade routes, bringing a degree of prosperity where
once only grim survival existed. The unoccupied islands were simply colonised by
whoever wanted to live that far away, adopting a lifestyle of fishermen and whalers to
support themselves on the bleak atolls.

Ingolfur Arnarson, a Norwegian chieftain, was the first settler of Iceland, arriving with
his household and family in 874. Finding that the land stretched for many miles, he
constructed a small settlement on a headland on the southwest coast of the island.
With little else but open grass and soft porous volcanic rock, his farmstead was built of
turf. The settlement supported itself with grazing sheep and fishing. Sailing back home
to collect timber and other vital supplies, knowledge of the colonisation soon spread,
causing a wave of Norwegians, displaced by the confiscations of Harald Finehair, to
flock to Iceland in search of lands away from the persecution of kings.

Further discoveries were made in the seas to the west of Iceland. In 978 Snæbjorn
Galti was the first Viking to navigate to Greenland, following up on tales of its first
sighting by Gunnbjorn Ulfsson years before when he had been driven off course by
bad weather. Four years later Erik the Red, declared an outlaw for murder, decided
to sail west to see if Snæbjorn had been telling the truth and became the first man to
temporarily settle Greenland as he named it.

Returning to Iceland he organised a massive expedition of 25 ships packed with 500
people and everything needed to establish a new colony. Eleven ships failed to reach
their destination but the remainder established two settlements, the eastern one at
Brattahlid and a western one, further north near Nuuk.

Erik's son Leif did not rest at his father's seat of power but continued exploring westwards,
spurred on by news of far off lands reported by Bjarni Herjolfsson. Sailing out with a small
crew, Leif set foot on a number of places he named Helluland, Markland and Vinland,
which roughly translate to flat stone-land, wood-land and wine-land. A temporary
settlement was established and Vinland probably continued to be infrequently visited as
a source of timber for the wood-poor colonies on Greenland and Iceland.

Greenland's remote settlements flourished, at their height providing homes for nearly
3,000 people. It survived as a nation for five centuries before the gradual cooling of
climate change slowly froze their fields and pastures, bringing starvation and ultimately
conflict with the native Inuit tribes.


### The Persecution of the Franks
Whilst the petty British and Irish kingdoms constantly weakened themselves with
internecine feuding, the Frankish kingdom was a strong empire that had unified
much of western and central Europe under the rule of Charlemagne. The strength and
power of the Franks was legendary; thus many Vikings avoided the Frankish coastline,
preferring to raid easier targets. Once Charlemagne died however, his empire began to
slowly fracture over the succeeding decades.

Finally between 834 and 839 the Vikings began attacking Frisia and Aquitane, slowly
growing in confidence. Eventually realising that no organised resistance existed, from
843 onwards the raiders began founding permanent settlements along the coast. The
destabilising threat of raids encouraged local rulers to pay off the invaders in exchange
for moving on. This tactic worked but proved to be cripplingly expensive in the long
term, the chance of earning tribute only encouraging larger raiding fleets to return in
subsequent years. In 845 Paris was raided for the first time and forced to pay a large
tribute of 7,000 pounds of silver, only to be raided again in 857 and 861.

Between 882 and 911 the Vikings grew bolder yet, blazing a path of utter destruction
on shrinking Frankish soil. Ultimately, finding no other way to prevent the sea
wolves from ravaging his kingdom, King Charles the Simple offered the lands
around Rouen to the Norwegian Viking leader Hrolfr the Ganger in exchange for
protecting the Franks against all future raiding. The clever move worked, using one
set of Vikings to guard against the others. To seal the bargain, Hrolfr was baptised
and became known as Rollo, whilst the dukedom was renamed Normandy – or
land of the North men.

Over the next couple of centuries Rollo's descendents continued to rule the province,
slowly adding to its boundaries and even raiding far off lands in Italy. The future
William the Conqueror is of direct lineage from his Viking ancestor.


### The Origin of the Rus
Whilst the Norwegians and Danes spread westwards, the Swedish Vikings of Gotaland
and Svealand began exploring eastwards. The motivation of these expeditions was trade,
initially exchanging goods across the Baltic. Once traders became aware of the market
opportunities further south, they began using the major rivers of eastern Europe to
transport goods between the Baltic and the Black Sea, where lay mighty Byzantium, or
Miklagard as the Vikings named it.

The Vikings who travelled these regions were called Varangians, which simply meant
sea-farers. From the mid eighth century many Varangians settled in the important inland
trading post of Ladoga, which lay on the Volkov River that connected it to Novgorod.
Eventually trade was supplemented with raids and during 859 the Varangians extracted
servile tribute from the coastal Finnic and Slavic tribes. All too soon these extortions
drove the tribes to rebel against the raiders. In 862 the Varangian Rus were forced back
to Scandinavia but the tribes bickered amongst themselves, resulting in the Varangians
being invited back to enforce peace.

The chief amongst the Varangian Rus was Rurik and he took up the reins of authority,
ruling over the region. In addition to controlling Ladoga and the Byzantine trade routes,
he founded a new settlement named Holmgard near Novgorod, which he decreed as
the capital of the Rus lands, eventually to become known as Russia. Over the next few
centuries the Varangians intermarried with the local Slavic tribes, gradually losing their
Scandinavian roots.

Many Varangians sailed up the Volkov, Lovat and Dnieper rivers creating new
settlements or conquering existing towns along the trade route. The greatest threat
faced by traders was the nomadic Pecheneg who often attacked boats as they were
portaged around seven sets of rapids on the Dnieper River.

In 882 Prince Oleg, Rurik's successor, launched an attack on Kiev, an important town
half way along the trade route, which was under the control of two Varangian leaders
Askold and Dir. After capturing the town, Oleg moved the Rus capital there, where it
remained until 968 when the nomadic Pechenegs tried to destroy it but were forced to
retire after a fruitless siege.

Prince Oleg strengthened the Rus hold over trade when in 907 he launched a huge
invasion force south against Byzantium. The great city sued for peace and paid a tribute
of linen, silk, gold, wine and fruit. To ensure a continuing peace treaty, Oleg negotiated
trading rights between Byzantium and the Rus, which was reprised in 911, allowing,
amongst other things, for Varangians to join the Emperor's personal guard. Many
Viking chieftains and kings serve in the Varangian Guard before returning home and
ascending to a throne.


> #### Varangian Trade Goods
> The Trade Route between the Baltic and Byzantium was used to carry a wide range of
> diverse merchandise.
> 
> The Baltic regions provided high quality timber suitable for ship building, exotic furs,
> uniquely flavoured honey, slaves and amber. Scandinavia produced high quality iron
> ingots, armour, weapons, wool and carved wooden or ivory handicrafts. Byzantium in

The Rurik dynasty continued to thrive throughout the Viking Age, intermittently
suffering a number of struggles for succession, which resulted in the kin slaying of
numerous brothers seeking the position of Grand Prince of Rusland.


## Viking Timeline
Although the previous section has given a rough overview of Viking history, albeit
somewhat biased towards Scandinavian expansion, unfortunately not everything can be
covered in detail. To help Games Masters identify when famous events occurred or which
king was in power when, a timeline has been provided of history across the Viking world.

Those readers who are unfamiliar with Viking history are encouraged to take these
names and events and look them up on the internet for more detail. The following
table should provide an invaluable resource for planning historically based campaigns.

This chapter grants an overview of Viking society and culture, explaining the class
system, social codes and a few of the conventions used by the Vikings in their everyday
life. These are important aspects for any roleplaying setting, since scenarios are often
built upon the restrictions of society and the drives, ambitions and inequalities of its
people.

Whether you wish to survive in a gritty historical campaign or heroically slay giants in
a mythic one, the social characteristics of status, honour and death remain the same.

Games Masters should take care to read through this section a couple of times to grasp
the flavour of Scandinavian life. However, whilst this chapter provides many details,
it must be remembered that this is merely an overview. Much of the information
presented are rough generalisations and may even portray interesting facts that are
anachronistic to local customs elsewhere across the Viking world.


## Social Structure
During the Viking Age most people live in extended 'families' of relatives and
kinfolk grouped together on the same farmstead. The steading is the minimum social
cooperative required to survive in the harsh northern climate and because of this it is
the core basis of Scandinavian society.

This collective family can consist of several married couples, one spouse of each is
usually, but not necessarily, blood related to the owner of the steading. In addition
to children, each household may also have bondsmen and thralls increasing their
numbers, some of whom could be married and possess children too. Taking this into
consideration, an average small steading might comprise of anywhere from 10 to 20
people. Larger farmsteads would typically number more folk.

The reasons for such communal life are fundamentally due to the vast amount of land
and work required to provide a subsistence level of living. In the poorer lands of the
north, good arable land is rare, the soil stony or overgrown with forest and the ground
frozen or snow covered for five or six months of the year. Substituting herding for crop
raising requires yet more land for grazing and winter fodder.

Due to the difficulty of food production, very few settlements ever develop into towns.
Those which do are wholly dependent on trade to exist, little more than a commercial
centre whose populations can shrink dramatically in the winter months when some
traders return to their own steadings.

In spite of the distances between farmsteads, most remain clustered in the same relative
area for mutual support and defence, communal decisions led by local chieftains. Over
time regions begin to be unified under the authority of jarls and eventually kings, as
the Scandinavians slowly transform from tribes to national kingdoms. In fact, such
amalgamations are a prime source of Norwegian and Danish migrations, in an attempt
to locate new places where a man can rule over his own stead without interference.

Unification aside, for most of the Viking Age, families and steads are the basis of society.
Blood feuds, avenging wrongs done to a relative – even distantly related kinfolk – are
commonplace, since your family are the only people guaranteed to stand beside you
in times of trouble. Similarly the crews of ships that go Viking, that is to trade or raid,
are often the men folk of several neighbouring steadings who pool their resources to
finance and man the voyage.


## Class and Rank
Viking society has a number of social divisions that rank people according to their
liberty, land ownership and authority. Unlike other societies in Europe of the time,
Scandinavian social classes are fairly loose, allowing someone to rise from thraldom to
become a king if they are ambitious or blessed with good fortune.

The Viking class system is inherited from ancient times, described and taught in the
mythological poem Rigsthula. Roughly speaking society is broken into those who are
thralls, those that are karls and those regarded as jarls.


### Thralls
Thralls are the lowest class, further subdivided into slaves and bondsmen. Slaves are usually
captives taken in a raid and given out as part of the plunder. They are frequently traded;
selected to serve as concubines or fill labourer positions back at the family farmstead.

A slave need not have been a foreigner from a distant land. Norwegian Vikings can
own Swedish and Danish slaves and vice versa for example. Some Viking laws allow a
convicted thief to be sentenced to act as a slave to he who the thief stole from.

Bondsmen differ from slaves as they are of a higher class reduced in status due to
debt. To repay what they owe, a bondsman is forced by law to work off their deficit by
serving the man they owe. A bondsman is therefore a temporary rank, which can be
recovered from.

Thralls work alongside their owners but are generally given the hardest or most
repugnant work to do. Male thralls often dig peat, reap hay, build walls or stay out
shepherding the livestock. Female thralls churn butter, grind grain and wash laundry,
all of which involve backbreaking labour.

To ensure recalcitrant thralls do not flee the steading, their hair is often close cropped and
in addition some wear slave collars around their neck. Despite these indignities, most
slaves are reasonably well treated or even welcomed into the close knit community of
the family. Since everyone, not just the thralls, has to work hard to survive and they are
allowed to earn their own money in hope of purchasing their freedom, Viking slavery is
relatively liberal compared with the hardship faced by slaves on the continent. They can
even marry and are legally permitted to take vengeance on those who abuse their wife!

A thrall can be freed by their master for good service or loyalty, or their freedom
purchased by a third party. A freedman ceases being chattel and is adopted into the
family proper, gaining the rights of inheritance, testifying in legal cases and future
children being free from slave status. To celebrate such manumissions the family holds
a feast, which includes the ritual slaughter of a sheep.

Most steadings possess several thralls with which they run the farm. Usually the number
of thralls is less than the karls to deter any thought of revolt, which occasionally does
occur. Although rare, accounts tell of maltreated slaves killing everyone on the farm to
ensure their escape.

'During the first winter, Hjorleifr decided to settle permanently where he had landed, by the
headland where he built two houses. In the spring, he hitched two slaves to the plough in
order to till the field. The slaves took their revenge for this abuse by enticing Hjorleifr and his
men, one at a time, out of sight of the buildings and killing them. Once the entire household
had been dispatched, the slaves took a boat and rowed to a nearby island.'

A male slave costs an average of 12 ounces of silver, whereas a female costs about 8
ounces – the equivalent price of a milk cow. Exceptionally strong, skilled or pretty
slaves are valued much higher.


### Karls
Most Vikings belong to the social class of karl. These are the common folk who are
free from bondage. All members of the class can bear weapons, seek protection under
the law, have freedom of speech and participate at the thing (assembly) – an unheard of
liberty and franchise compared to the peasants of Europe.

Like thralls there are many subdivisions of rank within the generic class of karl. These
in ascending order of precedence are leysingi, karls, bondi, hauldr and godi.

Leysingi (freedmen) are freed slaves who are still obligated to their former owners; being
expected to consult their ex-master's approval before undertaking marriage, business
deals and law cases. In return the former owner is obliged to offer legal protection,
support and maintenance.

Karl is often used as the more specific title for a free man who does not own a boat or
land of his own. By far and away more numerous than the other ranks, they usually find
employment as farmhands, servants, herders, hunters, traders, craftsmen or fishermen,
working in exchange for room and board.

Bondi are tenant farmers, working a croft or stead for an absentee owner. Those that
work hard can turn a respectable profit from these steadings, above and beyond the
annual rent payments.

Hauldr are farmers who own their lands outright, possessing the freehold and hereditary
rights to it. Such rights belong to the family and cannot be taken or overthrown by
anyone, not even the jarls or kings. The wealthier the lands or powerful the family
connections, the more status a hauldr has.

Above all of these are the godi. Technically a godi is a respected hauldr who has been
granted legal and administrative responsibilities by his peers. Godi lead the religious
observances but their main task is to oversee disputes and make just decisions, acting
like a local chieftain. The office of a godi relies on the continued support of the freemen
under his authority and can be lost due to neglect or bias.


### Jarls
Viking nobility is the highest social class. These are the leaders of Scandinavia, respected
chieftains who possess the titles of landsmenn, styraesmen (ship owners), jarls and
kings. A landsmann might rule over a small fjord, whereas a jarl could be responsible
for a petty kingdom. They use their authority to raise troops for war, fund fleets of
merchant ships, provide safe markets and protect the honour of the people they rule
over.

Unlike European feudal nobility, Scandinavian aristocracy is not normally inherited;
although matters begin to change towards the end of the Viking Age. To become a
ruler one must instead accumulate enough wealth, fame and popular support to be
seen as a leader. Without the loyalty of their own freemen, a jarl or king can be, and
frequently are, deposed either by being voted out of office or by violent coup d'états
led by ambitious warriors.

Nobility is a temporary rank, not a sacred right, and confers no special consideration
from the egalitarian minded Scandinavians of this time. A jarl is given respect only if
he acts like a jarl. Failure to do so results in his commands being ignored by the men
under his authority. Technically there is no legal obligation to follow a noble's orders
but doing so can bring problems if the ruler's support is strong.

Likewise, the authority wielded by a noble is his alone. The relations of a ruling noble
have no additional authority beyond what they themselves possess. Thus the son of a
king has no special rights above that of the karl standing beside him.

Although the rank is not inherited, by the end of the Viking period the gradually
increasing wealth and loyalty accumulated by a family can ease the transfer of power
from father to son.

Rulers are usually dynamic men capable of inspiring warriors in battle or convincing
them in public debate. A noble is expected to be generous with his wealth and
possessions, giving out gifts and granting hospitality to all who pay visit. They must
maintain a personal guard of warriors, hearth men or thanes who support them in the
thing or battle. Such hirdmadr possess high status, sharing that of their lord. Skalds are
also given patronage in order to spread the jarl's fame and indeed are held in barely less
stature than the ruler himself.


## Those Outside of Society
Despite holding the rank of freemen, beggars and vagrants are regarded as having less
status than that of freed slaves. Lacking land or a permanent residence often means a
man is technically outside of the law and cannot be charged. However this is not so
much an immunity from legal prosecution but rather a dangerous vulnerably due to
lack of protection; indeed a vagabond can be robbed or even castrated with impunity!

Transients include, but are not necessarily limited to, tramps, sorcerers, seers, witches,
beggars and of course outlaws. Although outside the law, some famous or infamous
practitioners of magic may still command a great deal of respect. Thus it is often wise
to treat a vagrant with respect, since you never know what they are capable of or whom
they might be related to!

### Women
Viking society has very distinct gender roles for men and women. It is not normally
possible for a woman to participate in a raiding trip or join an overseas mercantile
expedition. Women are expected to stay at home and maintain the farmstead. Those
that cross gender boundaries are often ostracised and sometimes even punished. It is,
for example, forbidden in some lands for a woman to wear male clothes, cut their hair
short or to bear a weapon.

Women are under the authority of their father or husband, with little or no legal rights.
Under Scandinavian law, women cannot become a ruler or godi, judge or witness and
are barred from direct political activity by being prohibited from speaking at the thing.

However, Viking women are permitted a great deal of domestic authority. They control
the finances of the family and steading, running the farm whilst their husbands are away
raiding or trading. They are also stringently protected by the law against unwelcome
advances, such as kissing or forced intercourse, which in turn allows them to lead more
social lives, a freedom forbidden to women of other cultures at this time. A woman can
inherit her husband's property and indeed most possess their own lands as part of their
dowry. One of the most powerful levers a woman has is the ease and right of divorce,
the chance of losing a wife's dowry being a significant threat against her husband.

Wives who own or run successful farmsteads are granted a high degree of respect.
Widows especially can exert a strong authority over their destiny and possessions,
frequently superseding men in honour of their courage, will and wisdom. It is often
the women's role to berate their men folk to protect the family honour, often inciting
the start of blood feuds or acts of revenge.

Women are rarely harmed in Viking society. To abuse a woman is a shameful act but
to injure one is a grave dishonour. Even playful violence such as throwing snowballs is
frowned upon. This behaviour is so reinforced that women are excluded during attacks
on a rival family or household. If a house is to be burnt down to kill the men folk or
drive them outside, women and children are always allowed to leave unharmed first.
Of course the women are free to refuse the offer if they wish to die alongside their
husbands or sons.

There are only two acceptable situations where violence can be used against women.
The first is during a Viking raid, when women are frequently captured as plunder to be
sold into slavery. The second is when the woman is using evil sorcery to cause mischief
or harm.

## Personality and Beliefs
Viking culture is based around a number of core virtues and beliefs, which hold society
together. The difficult climate, dispersed population and extended families make these
moral codes of paramount importance. Without them survival is questionable.

The reputation of a man is based upon his adherence to these ethical qualities and
nothing is dearer to a Viking than his name and standing. In Scandinavian eyes it is
better to die with honour (drengskapr) and be admired, than to have his repute stained
with shame (nidr) and be reviled.

Respected men are called drengr. They should be brave, generous, noble, magnanimous,
fair minded, respectful, pragmatic, morally strong, honourable in his word and able to
maitain his self control. These are the values upon which a man bases his self-respect
and what the community expects from him. Those who maintain them in adversity are
remembered, viewed as people to be emulated and are often sought out to take up the
mantle of the ruling class.

Nidingr, shameful men, have no respect or support from the community. A jarl or king
who acts without adhering to Viking values will soon find themselves overthrown, their
own men deserting them. Others of lower rank are merely exiled or isolated, cut off
from social contact and unable to trade for necessary goods; their name forgotten or
spat upon after death.


### Courage
Bravery is an expected quality in all men but is particularly praised in women. Courage
does not equate to stupidity. It is perfectly acceptable to retreat from overwhelming
odds or flee in terror when confronted by the supernatural.


> 'Beware of going where overwhelming force opposes you. There is more honour in
> accumulating little by little than in overreaching and falling down flat.'
> 
> - Vatnsdæla Saga


Men are expected to stand up to their enemies. A Viking will engage in single combat,
even if they are certain they cannot win, because it is important to display their courage.
Kolfinnur in the Kjalnesinga Saga announces his plan to duel with Bui but when
observers advise that the match is unevenly stacked against him, Kolfinnur replies,
'there are two outcomes to every danger: either I will live or I will die'.

The sagas record the names of those who demonstrated unusual levels of courage.
Men remembered for facing multiple foes, beating terrifying creatures or deliberately
sacrificing themselves for another. Such as Grettir who defeats a number of horrific
monsters, or Bjarni Grimolfsson in Erik's Saga, who gave up his place on a lifeboat
and purposely drowned to allow an Icelandic coward to survive the sinking of their
worm-eaten ship.


### Fatalism
At the birth of every baby the three Norns (Nornar) decree when it must die. Nothing
can postpone this fate, or wyrd, so most Vikings are philosophical about facing death.
However, although death is predetermined, little else is. A person can live their life as
they will, determining the nature and manner of their death. It is generally considered
better to be adventurous and daring, rather than stay at home and pass peacefully away
in bed.

Fatalism also involves the belief in omens, whether they are dreams or the prophecies
of a soothsayer. The simplest of forebodings can cause a Viking to abandon a course of
action. Even the stumbling of a horse whilst riding to join a ship can be interpreted as
a warning, perhaps from the Disir or the rider's own Fylgjar.


### Fortune
A lucky man is a person to follow or ally oneself to and lucky talismans are treasured.
Vikings are very superstitious about the power of luck (gæfa), which is akin to, but not
the same as, fate. Lucky men always succeed, no matter what is brought to bear against
them, thus they are often sought after to join ship crews or raiding parties.

Likewise nothing can help unlucky men, who are spurned even if liked or sympathised
with. A man seen as plagued with bad luck would be abandoned mid way through a
voyage, rather than risk him staying aboard. Some acts are considered unlucky too,
such as pillaging a dead man for his weapons and armour. If the arms had failed their
previous owner, then they were obviously unlucky charms that might infect their
plunderer with ill fortune too. Many of the famous swords reputed to be forged by
dwarfs were accursed items whose power tempted men to risk the bad luck associated
with them.

### Generosity
It is a commonly held belief that if skill or fortune has blessed a man with wealth,
it is proper for that man to pass part of that prosperity to the people around him. A
generous man will help others in times of strife or give them a hand to achieve their
own affluence, rather than horde away their treasures where they do no good.

Generosity can be expressed in a number of ways, the quality of food and drink offered
at the table for example. A lord who feasts on fine vittles whilst offering fare of lesser
quality to his guests would be considered miserly, whereas if the food is poor but the
best that household can offer, then it is most generous.

Other forms of generosity may be the loaning of a ship to a trusted friend or family
member, the giving of clothing as a gift, or arming and armouring of men who join a
household. The most generous of men give up their personal possessions to aid those
who have suffered disaster, such as a prize cow when a neighbour's herd have been
slaughtered by wolves.

The story of Ref in Gautreks Saga is a humorous tale of a young man who always gives
away his most prized possession, only to receive a greater gift in return. Eventually Ref
becomes a Jarl of high repute!


### Honour
Honour is the steadfastness of a Viking in keeping his word. Oathbreaking is considered
one of the most contemptible deeds a man can be accused of, since the word of a man
is paramount to his ability to make deals and bargains. If suspected of lying or cheating
he will be unable to function within society, doomed to be outcaste as everyone will
distrust him. Lacking literacy, a Viking contract is normally made before witnesses and
sealed by a handshake. Such an agreement is binding.

> 'Gunnlaug said, 'Betray me not if I bring thee water in my helm'. 'I will not betray thee,'
> said Raven. Then went Gunnlaug to a brook and fetched water in his helm, and brought it
> to Raven; but Raven stretched forth his left hand to take it, but with his right hand drove
> his sword into Gunnlaug's head, and that was a mighty great wound. Then Gunnlaug said,
> 'Evilly hast thou beguiled me, and done traitorously wherein I trusted thee.'
> 
> - Gunnlaugs Saga

This virtue seems difficult to resolve with the Viking penchant for trickery. The gods
repeatedly engaged in trickery to emerge victorious in their quests; not only Loki but
Odin and even Thor resort to tricks to overcome seemingly irresolvable challenges. A
trick is acceptable if it is humorous or clever but frowned on in most other situations. In
the Heimskringla 30 Vikings are taken prisoner by Earl Eirik and are being beheaded,
when Sigurd Bue's son plays the following trick, which results in the release of the
remaining survivors:

'There sat also a very handsome man with long hair, who twisted his hair over his head, put
out his neck, and said, 'Don't make my hair bloody.' A man took the hair in his hands and
held it fast. Thorkel hewed with his axe; but the Viking twitched his head so strongly that he
who was holding his hair fell forwards, and the axe cut off both his hands, and stuck fast in
the earth. Then Earl Eirik came up, and asked, 'Who is that handsome man?'

### Hospitality
Hospitality, or the granting of refuge, sustenance and protection, is one of the most
important virtues of Scandinavian life. Travellers lost in unfamiliar lands or caught
in the snow or cold will most likely die without shelter and food. Thus hospitality is
not only a charitable act but also one of self preservation, since men facing death are
capable of desperate actions and most steadings are remote from their neighbours.

The pact between host and guest is sacrosanct. Bed and board is offered with the
understanding that no ill words or violence be given by either, even if the two are the
worst of rivals. Odin is the guardian of hospitality and is reputed to send misfortune to
those who withhold or abuse it.

To grant hospitality is a double edged sword. Although it improves the host's reputation
and may forge bonds of friendship between strangers, there is a risk that the guest
may outstay his welcome, since a host cannot force a guest to leave once hospitality
is granted. Many stanzas in the Havamal (the Viking poem that taught ethics and
wisdom) advise against over eating, excessive drinking, boasting or making oneself a
bore.

A guest who remains under his host's roof for too long, may find himself hosting his
original benefactor in the following year, along with half his family! Of course during
the winter months a guest may very well find himself cut off from further travel due
to the weather or accumulated snow. In such a case it was considered good manners to
help out with the work on the steading, rather than sit about eating his way through
the host's carefully stored provisions.

Refusing to give hospitality is a shameful act but is permitted in certain circumstances.
Outlaws may be denied hospitality, for example.

> Greetings to the host, 
> The guest has arrived, 
> In which seat shall he sit?

> 
> Water, too, that he may wash before eating, 
> Handcloth's and a hearty welcome, 
> Courteous words, then courteous silence 
> That he may tell his tale
> 
> - Havamal

### Humour
A good sense of humour is vital for most Vikings, acting as a legitimate outlet for
feelings of frustration or anger but still preserving their reputation. Indeed clever
witticisms can add greatly to a man's repute and many Vikings cracked a last sardonic
quip before dying. Viking flippancy emphasises wry understatement, the forerunner of
black humour.


> #### Viking Humour
> Thorgrim the Easterling went and began to climb up on the hall; Gunnar sees that a red
> kirtle passed before the window slit, and thrusts out the bill, and smote him on the middle.
> Thorgrim's feet slipped from under him, and he dropped his shield, and down he toppled
> from the roof. Then he goes to Gizur and his band as they sat on the ground.
> 
> Gizur looked at him and said, 'Well, is Gunnar at home?'
> 
> 'Find that out for yourselves,' said Thorgrim; 'but this I am sure of, that his bill is at home,'
> and with that he fell down dead.
> 
> - Njals Saga


### Loyalty
Loyalty is a close relation to honour but refers more to keeping faith with comrades,
relatives and rulers than the legal bond of one's word. A Viking can show loyalty to
his friends, extended family, jarl or even his animals, standing up for them in times of
adversity. Ties of loyalty are often tested, especially when a blood feud erupts between
families. It is a noble thing to stand by a father or brother, even if they are in the
wrong; many of the greatest stories tell of the unwilling protagonist supporting a family
member or king against a close friend.

Huskarls swear allegiance to their jarl or king, in return for being armed and supported.
Such oaths can include promises to fight in the forefront of battle, never flee and
avenge the life of their lord if he falls.

Viking loyalty is not blind obedience however. A supporter is free to question the
motivations of those they follow and even disregard a command if it is viewed as
dishonourable. In the Gisla Saga, Eyjolf orders his man Havardr to kill a woman who
dashes a purse of silver into his face. Havardr refuses, stating 'Our journey is about as
bad as it can be already without our doing this dastard's deed' – in response to which
Eyjolf accuses his man of treachery. The rest of the warriors support their comrade in
arms and refuse to follow their lord's disgraceful command.


### Manliness
Vikings are very sensitive to their manliness being questioned or insulted. To compare a
man with an animal, especially a dog, or accuse him of acting in a womanly manner is
a mortal insult. In fact some laws forbid the use of such insults, permitting the accused
to seek compensation or even the right to kill his insulter.

> 'Then there are three terms which occasion bringing such a serious suit against a man
> that they are worthy to outlaw him. If a man call a man unmanly, or homosexual, or
> demonstrably homosexually used by another man, he shall proceed to prosecute as with other
> terms of abuse, and indeed a man has the right to avenge with combat for these terms of
> abuse.'
> 
> - Gragas

A Viking always has to defend his manliness, since charges of effeminacy imply that
he always takes the submissive or cowardly role, not only sexually but in leadership,
warfare and the like. Of course most insults of this nature are simply a method of
provoking a fight without fouling oneself with a more provocative deed and lack any
real conviction. However, any offence that might blot a man's honour has to be put
down firmly in order to maintain the respect of the community. Thus Vikings are
always alert for wrongs against their reputation and ready to avenge them.

> 'Because,' said Skarphedinn, 'thou art the sweetheart of the Swinefell's troll, if, as men say,
> he does indeed turn thee into a woman every ninth night.' Then Flosi spurned the money,
> and said he would not touch a penny of it, and then he said he would only have one of two
> things: either that Hauskuld should fall unatoned, or they would have vengeance for him.
> 
> - Njals Saga


### Tenacity
In many of the sagas, Viking men show their tenacity by overcoming the elements, or
battling to the last despite sporting horrific wounds. A man should be imperturbable
no matter the circumstances.

> 'They were very great swordsmen, and their onslaught was both hard and hot; and now they
> gave him some wounds with spear-thrusts, but he still fought on with great stoutness and
> bravery; and they got such knocks from him, both with stones and strokes, that there was
> not one of them without a wound who came nigh him, for Gisli was not a man to miss his
> mark. Now Eyjolf and his kinsmen press on hard, for they felt that their fame and honour
> lay on it. Then they thrust at him with spears, so that his entrails fall out; but he swept up
> the entrails with his shirt and bound the rope round the wound.'
> 
> - Gisli's Saga


## Law and Punishment
Scandinavian society has a sophisticated legal system to protect free men and their
possessions. These laws are decided by communal consensus and preserved in tradition,
passed down orally from each generation to the next. Unlike the lands outside of Viking
control, laws are firmly in the hands of free men, independent of overruling by kings
and jarls, who themselves are equally subject to them.

Most folk adhere to the law, since it protects them against disorder and lawlessness. Since
Scandinavia is illiterate during this period, only trained Law Speakers (logsogumadur)
know all the legal codes in detail. They are responsible for the memorisation,
preservation and clarification of the laws, whereas the law council (logretta), consisting
of the godar and their advisors, debate new legal procedures.

Government is based upon the thing, an assembly of the free men in a local area. The
gathering is used primarily to debate and settle issues that have affected the community.
People discuss their complaints and try to settle their differences with negotiation and
compromise. If this fails, a lawsuit can be placed, which is judged by the attendees.
Other matters handled at the thing are marriage arrangements, the offering of lands
and animals for rent, the payment of said rent and general trading of goods and services
not available in a small collective of steadings (bygthir).

The site of the thing is blessed by a godi who performs religious sacrifices to bless the
assembly. The hallowed ground is deemed to be an area of truce. Weapons are not
openly borne or tied fast to their scabbards with fridbond (peace knots).

At the larger regional things, laws are recited by the law speaker and new legislation
proposed by the attending law council, which would then be placed to the vote by the
people – each man present gaining a single equal vote. These important gatherings
also hold elections of godi and jarls, earls or kings and the settlement of disputes that
involve offenses beyond the borders of a local thing. These events are so large that they
often last a week or more, because of the amount of legal business to be dealt with; thus
families often build booths (budir), small stone or turf structures over which a fabric
roof can be erected, in which to live during the assembly.

As time passed and the Scandinavian clans and tribes became ever more unified, these
things grew to encompass common law for entire nations, gaining names such as the
Althing in Iceland, Disathing in Svealand, Alla Gotars Thing in the Gotaland and the
Haugathing in Norway.


### Lawsuits
A lawsuit is brought before the presiding godi or godar by plaintiffs making a formal
charge at the Law Rock. Each case is heard in the order they had been presented, over
the course of the thing.


> #### The Presentation of a Lawsuit
> 'I give notice of a suit for assault laid down by law against Gunnar Hamond's son; for that
> he rushed with an onslaught laid down by law on Thorgeir Otkell's son and wounded him
> with a body wound, which proved a death wound, so that Thorgeir got his death.'
> 
> 'I say on this charge he ought to become a convicted outlaw, not to be fed, not to be forwarded,
> not to be helped or harboured in any need. I say that his goods are forfeited, half to me and
> half to the men of the Quarter, whose right it is by law to seize the goods of outlaws. I give
> notice of this charge in the Quarter Court, into which this suit ought by law to come. I give
> this lawful notice in the hearing of all men at the Hill of Laws.'
> 
> - Njal's Saga


The law court is comprised solely of the godar present, with a law speaker who can be
called upon to settle any disputed points of law. The godar exert their authority during
the presentation of the suit, determining whether the case is legitimate and ensuring
the correct procedures are followed. They also decide the subsequent punishment or
compensation due. However the outcome of the case itself is resolved by a public vote
of the attending bondi and hauldr.

Those who plan to present a lawsuit or know there is a case against them, often travel
to the thing bringing as many relatives and friends as they can muster, in order to sway
the vote in their favour. During the wait for their hearing, the plaintiff and defendant
often remain at their booths presenting their side of the case to interested parties.

Once a case has been scheduled for hearing, those involved are summoned to the Law
Stone. The case is opened with the plaintiff swearing an oath of honesty and stating his
accusation. He presents his witnesses, who either vouch for the plaintiff 's honour and
reputation, or recount their personal observation of the crime committed.

The defendant is then allowed his rebuttal after swearing a similar oath of honesty.
He may use the law to undermine his accuser's position and attempt to invalidate
the case using his own witnesses or legal knowledge. For instance when Gunner
Hamundarson was accused of murder, it was pointed out by his witness that Gunnar
and his companions had been outnumbered 25 to two, so it was their ambushers who
had obviously meant to kill him and not vice versa!

Either participant who feels mortally insulted or guesses that the case will not go in their
favour can insist on the right to settle the trial by arms, calling for a holmgang. This
ends the case with respect to the godi and normal legal procedure but is a dangerous or
desperate option, since fights often end with one man dead and the other permanently
maimed.

Cases are sometimes won before being put to a vote, testimony ignored because correct
legal procedure has not been used, regardless of the facts presented. In fact justice is
often not served due to bribery, intimidation of witnesses and even open violence in the
court itself. It is often necessary for the godi or local jarl to arrive with a large personal
retinue to ensure order is kept.


### Punishments
At the conclusion of the lawsuit, it is necessary for the godar to decide on the nature
of any punishment required. This can take the form of outlawry, compensation or a
combination of both.

Compensation is the normal form of settlement for crimes such as manslaughter,
maiming, slander, theft and so on. The amount to be paid depends on the wound
given, the status of the person killed or the worth of what was stolen.

General values of manbote (weregild) are one mark of silver for a thrall, 10 marks for
a freedman, 15 marks for a karl, 20 marks for a bondi and anywhere between 40 and
120 marks for a hauldr, depending on his holdings and whether he held a position of
authority.

These prices are subject to caveats, however. The slaying of a man in self defence when
ambushed or tricked, evokes no compensation. Whereas a man convicted of attempted
murder has to pay the full amount, even though he may have failed to even injure his
victim. Compensation for maiming a man by blinding him in one eye or crippling a
limb is half their weregild. Blinding in both eyes is worth the full amount.

Less serious, but deliberate, injuries require the payment of one mark of silver per
serious wound or six minor wounds, plus the cost of the medical care, housing and
food costs until healed, which is at least an additional mark per month.

Killing of livestock or damage to buildings usually incurs compensation of at least
twice the worth of the loss. Even inappropriately touching a woman costs half a mark,
twice that if the groping strayed nearer more sensitive locations; assuming of course the
molester survives to reach court.

Outlawry is generally used to punish deliberate killings. Open murders, where the
family are warned in advance of the planned assassination, result in being declared an
outlaw for the period of three years (fjorbaugsgardur). Hidden murders or deliberate
arson are punished by permanent outlawry (skoggangur) and in addition all their lands
and possessions are forfeited, half assigned to the outlaw's victims and half to his former
neighbours.

An outlaw can be killed with no fear of any legal consequences. They are literally
outside of society. Aiding an outlaw brings the risk of being fined or declared an outlaw
yourself, so the life of an outlaw is a lonely exile full of fear that the next person they
meet will be seeking their head.

Scandinavian law provides no method of actually forcing the loser of the case to adhere
to the settlement decided. It is up to the winner to extract any compensation owed,
or drive the guilty man away with threats. Often the friends and relatives of a victim
actively pursue the outlaw, hunting him until he is found and slain. Unfortunately this
often propagates enduring blood feuds, despite the legality and justice of the situation.


### Einvigi and Holmganga
Duelling is a method of settling disputes between two men. A duel can be over a legal
matter, extraction of debt, to defend one's honour or avenge the death of a friend or
relative. Einvigi (single combat) are less formal than holmganga (going to the island).
Such duels are legal and permitted as long as they adhere to strict rules.

To ensure hot blooded fights do not break out at the merest provocation, duels cannot
be fought until at least three days after the challenge. Failing to turn up to a duel
results in the supposed coward being declared an outlaw, stripped of all honour and
reputation.

> 'Jokull responded, 'You must now turn up to the duel if you have a man's heart, rather than
> a mare's. And if anyone fails to turn up, then a scorn-pole will be raised against him with
> this curse - that he will be a coward in the eyes of all men, and will never again share the
> fellowship of good folk, and will endure the wrath of the gods, and bear the name of truce-
> breaker.'
> 
> - Vatnsdæla Saga

If one participant is considered outclassed by his opponent, a substitute warrior can
volunteer to take his place. This prevents intimidating men from simply bullying their
way out of law cases or using the tradition to legally extort property from legitimate
owners.

The participants of the duel settle the terms of the fight in advance, deciding what
weapons can be used, who strikes first (usually the challenged man), the conditions
determining a victory (first blood, incapacitation or death) and what the winner will
receive. If an opponent dies his killer is immune from prosecution.

Duels are fought upon an ox hide or cloak, which designates the boundary of the
fighting area. This is roughly a square area of two and a half metres per side. Stepping
completely off the hide results in the loss of fight. Fleeing not only forfeits the combat
but brands the quitter as a craven coward, a fate worse than death.

Some holmgang are very formalised, the participants being limited to a predetermined
number of shields and alternating blows upon one another until all the shields break.
At which point the defenceless man has the option to honourably retire (and lose) or
continue with just his weapon.

## Marriage and Death
Far from being the consummation of romance, marriage in the Viking world is more of a
business arrangement between families. Often marriages are arranged to form alliances or
consolidate lands but generally both the bride and groom have some feelings for one another.

Suitors court women but often at their own risk. A woman's family tries to supervise the
contact between the two, restricting it to arranged visits of the suitor to their steading.
Blatant fawning is frowned upon as are romantic poems, which are considered morally
dangerous. A man who flirts too openly can be driven off or even killed by the woman's
family, fearing her dishonour.

After courting a woman, a suitor is expected to place a marriage proposal. Failing to
do so is considered an insult to the family, with the predictable feuds and violence to
follow. If on the other hand the marriage suit is refused, then it is the suitor's family
who are insulted.

If the suit is accepted, a betrothal must be made. This is a detailed commercial contract
to determine the mundr (bride price) and heimangerd (dowry), usually negotiated
between the woman's guardian and the suitor or his representative. In most cases
these will be the two fathers. Once an agreement is reached, hands are shaken before
witnesses and the wedding planned for within the year.

Weddings are large feasts held at the home of the bride's parents. It lasts for several days
with no formal ritual to actually join the bride and groom together. The wedding is
considered binding when witnesses view the couple departing for their marriage bed.

Marriage is not a permanent bond if there are difficulties. The failure to produce
children, abuse from either spouse, infidelity or even lack of respect are all valid reasons
for dissolving the union. Divorce in itself is very easy, just proclaiming it in front of
witnesses is enough. However a divorce requires that the woman be granted the return
of her dowry and in addition she may be entitled to one half of the steading, which she
too has worked hard to maintain. The bitter legal outfall and financial ruin of divorce
can cause terrible feuds between families and in a male dominated world wives often
use this threat to manipulate their husbands' actions.

### Death Rituals
Death rituals across Scandinavia vary greatly according to wealth and status. Most folk
are buried in graves along with a few daily tools and treasured belongings. Wealthier
personages have more grave goods, so to prevent the corpses being despoiled by grave
robbing, howes or mounds of earth are pilled over the grave to make access a little more
difficult.

Prosperous men and heroic leaders are often buried in ships. Dressed in fine garb, their
vessels stocked with a wide panoply of goods and animals, such as weapons, armour,
crockery, horses, hounds and even slaves. Although in the early days before the Viking
Age, weapons and shields were bent and broken to prevent their worth attracting grave
robbers, most Viking warriors are buried with their armaments intact, thieves held at
bay by superstition and the widespread tales of draugr, the walking dead.

Sometimes wives or female slaves join their husband in death, deliberately allowing
themselves to be killed as part of the funeral ritual. The famous account of a Rus
chieftain's death rites by an Arabic chronicler named Ibn Fadlan describes the gruesome
fate of a slave girl who wished to enter Valhalla with her lord. Unusually it seems the
Rus Vikings preferred cremation to burial, although the body was temporarily buried
whilst the funeral rites were arranged.

> 'One of the Rus was at my side and I heard him speak to the interpreter, who was present.
> I asked the interpreter what he said. He answered, 'He said, 'You Arabs are fools. ' 'Why?' I
> asked him. He said, 'You take the people who are most dear to you and whom you honour
> most and put them into the ground where insects and worms devour them. We burn him in
> a moment, so that he enters Paradise at once.' Then he began to laugh uproariously. When
> I asked why he laughed, he said, 'His Lord, for love of him, has sent the wind to bring him
> away in an hour.' And actually an hour had not passed before the ship, the wood, the girl,
> and her master were nothing but cinders and ashes. Then they constructed in the place where
> had been the ship which they had drawn up out of the river something like a small round
> hill, in the middle of which they erected a great post of birch wood, on which they wrote the
> name of the man and the name of the Rus king and they departed.'
> 
> - Ibn Fadlan's Account of the Rus


## Homes and Settlements
Most Vikings live on farmsteads. These can range from a single longhouse that shelters
both people and animals, to a large collection of outhouses and byres clustered around
a more impressively sized longhouse. Steads are usually built on well sloping, well
drained land, in close proximity to a source of drinking water and possess good views
over their approaches. With lawlessness and raiding a constant threat, it bodes well to
keep an eye out for the approach of strangers.

Depending on the fertility and suitability of the land, the number of nearby steads can
be limited, with large distances separating them. Few definable settlements existed; rather
the largest farmsteads encompass a population rivalling a hamlet, all working together
under the guidance of the owner. Fishing settlements are slightly different, many homes
clustered together in small villages on the sheltered beach of an inlet or fjord.

### Longhouses
Communal living within a longhouse is normal for families. Private or segregated
accommodation is a luxury few can afford; wasteful of building materials and fuel
for heating. In winter, less hardy animals are herded into stalls inside the longhouse,
sheltering them from the often intense cold. This serves two purposes. The first that
it cuts down on the amount of fodder the animals need to survive the months before
grazing is available once again. Secondly the animal's body heat is the prime source of
warmth inside the hall, limited wood stocks being reserved for cooking and light.

Due to the number of folk and animals that need to fit inside the longhouse, they can
be impressively large. A 'small' longhouse averages five metres across and up to 15 metres
long. The largest longhouses are no more than eight metres across but can be between
60 and 80 metres long, often shaped to swell a little wider in the mid sections. They
are constructed from two rows of central posts, which support the roof. Outer walls are
made from wood, either planks or logs; although in wood poor regions walls are made of
turf instead. In colder climes turf is sometimes added anyway as an extra insulating layer
against the walls and used as a roofing material to help hold the heat in winter. Turfed
roofs however have the age old problem of livestock climbing up to graze the grass.

Internally the longhouse is left open along the central aisle, providing passage along the
whole building. Placed along the middle of this section are stone lined troughs used as
fire pits. The outer isles on either side can be divided with wattle and daub partitions,
allowing small areas to act as storage rooms or stalls for livestock. The floor is normally
packed earth mixed with ashes to prevent the surface churning into mud.

In the main living section, the areas to either side of the central corridor are built up
above the earthen floor and planked over to provide an area to eat, sit, sleep or work.
These may be covered with furs and hides to provide a little softness and warmth.

Few windows are built into longhouses. The few which exist in better homes are
shuttered openings built into the end walls up near the roof. Most light comes from
closable smoke holes in the roof, which are supplemented by the central fires and
simple stone lamps that burn fish, seal or whale oil. Candles, although available, are
very expensive so only used by the wealthiest families. Thus the ambience inside a
longhouse is rather dim unless the smoke holes are fully uncovered.

Little furniture is used inside Viking homes. The master and mistress of the house
might have a straw stuffed box-bed built inside a closet for a small amount of privacy
and perhaps extra warmth. Trestle tables can be set up for meals or feasts but are taken
down afterwards to keep the central areas clear. The few other objects of note may be
wooden storage chests, often serving as seats, and a weaving loom. The longhouse of
a noble probably contains a 'high seat', a platform built between the roof pillars atop
which was set an ornately carved throne. This chair is often very broad, more akin to a
small settee, on which the master sits along with honoured guests.

Longhouses are often decorated. Posts and beam ends carved with fantastic knotwork
designs, wainscoting painted with scenes from the myths and walls hung with decorated
shields and wall hangings, although the latter were very expensive items.


### Steadings
Most farmsteads need additional buildings to supplement the central longhouse.
Outhouses such as byres are used to house livestock in the warmer months before
being freed to graze on summer pastures. Byres may be used to house thralls too but it
would take a callous master to segregate his workers in such a fashion, since it may be
a miserable experience to live in them during winter unless sleeping with the livestock
to keep warm.

Other buildings include partially subterranean, stone-lined storehouses used to keep
foodstuffs cold and secure from animals. In northern forest regions, food storehouses
are sometimes built atop a strong single pillar, normally a tree hewn off about four
metres above the ground. Access into the storehouse is only possible by a removable
ladder, which prevents animals, such as bears or wolverines, from climbing up and
breaking in during the spring.

Bath houses (saunas) are popular additions. People clean themselves by throwing water
over fire heated rocks to produce invigorating steam. They are popular places to give
birth. Some Icelandic steads use volcanically heated water to create heated bathing
pools.

A barn of sorts is usually needed to store the vast quantities of winter fodder for the
livestock, since keeping large amounts of hay inside the longhouse is a dangerous fire
risk. Winter fuel, be it split logs or cut peat, also needs to be stored out of the elements,
requiring yet another building.

Steads may also have their own smithy to repair and create tools, as well as, possibly, a
small smoke house in which meat is preserved. Both of these outbuildings are kept well
separated, downwind from the rest of the stead in case of accidental fires.

Those steads that border the sea or a river might possess a ship-house to protect the
vessel in winter and provide an indoor area to perform the myriad of repairs and
maintenance required to keep it seaworthy.


### Farming
Most Viking steads primarily focus on raising livestock. Cattle and sheep are the most
important animals. Milk cows are valuable because from them can be produced cheese,
butter and skyr, a type of soft cheese, which has the consistency and taste of yoghurt.
All these foodstuffs are valuable since they can be preserved over the winter when the
cows stop giving milk. Other cattle are used as a source of leather, sinews and meat,
often being butchered at the onset of winter due to the amount of fodder it will take to
feed them before spring arrives.

Although cattle in the Viking age are relatively small, rarely exceeding 1.2 metres at the
shoulder, it takes a lot of land to keep many of them. Depending on location, cattle
need about two tons of hay to survive over the winter, so each cow requires between
five and nine acres of land to grow its winter fodder, not including the land needed to
graze the beast in the meantime. A wealthy farmstead might only be able to support
one to two dozen cows at most.

Sheep are also small and reared for their wool, which is the primary source of fabric
for Viking clothes, tents and even ships sails. Castrated rams are communally grazed in
pastures, or left to roam wild in regions lacking wolves, whereas ewes are kept penned
for their milk and to ensure that lambs are not stolen or tagged with a neighbour's
mark. The fleece of sheep is not sheered but rather plucked or combed for its wool.
Older or weak animals are killed and eaten.

Horses are used as both transportation (riding or pulling sleds) and a source of meat.
Horse flesh is a staple part of a Viking diet, probably as a result of the animals being a
popular sacrifice to the gods. Horses are bred to fight too but as a sporting entertainment
like dog-baiting, rather than for warfare.

Goats and pigs are also kept as a source of food. Dogs often guard the steading by
barking when strangers approach and keep inquisitive wolves and bears at bay. Cats
are useful for pest control but skinned after death for their soft fur, which is used in
clothing.

Crops raised include a selection of grains such as barley, rye and oats, which are used
for bread or porridge. Vegetables range from the ubiquitous bean and cabbage to the
turnip. Fruits such as apples and plums can be cultivated over most of Scandinavia and,
lacking citrus fruits, vitamin C is obtained from birch bark.

To supplement their crops most Vikings gather up natural fruits and nuts – wild
strawberries, lingonberries and blueberries, which grow prolifically in the north. Wild
leeks are popular and coastal steadings sometimes gather seaweed to eat.

Hunting and fishing are an important part of survival, wild boars, game fowl, deer and
elk the usual sources of meat, especially during the spring when food stocks run low.
Game fish like salmon, perch, trout and pike live in most of the rivers and lakes, the
latter species often caught in the winter by drilling a hole in the ice and dangling a line
into the freezing water.

Fishing steads rely primarily on their fish catch during the year. Most of the land
around a northern fishing community is covered with open air racks from which gutted
cod and mackerel are hung to desiccate in the cold, dry winds, whilst family members
drive off hungry gulls. Herring is generally too small to dry so they are pickled or salted
instead. Occasionally in the Atlantic settlements seals, walrus and even whales are
hunted for food, skins, bone and ivory. Their flesh is difficult to preserve, so it is either
boiled then pickled in sour whey, smoked and hung in the rafters of the longhouse,
sewn into sealskin bags and dropped into deep water where it remains chilled but not
frozen, or most unsettling of all, dropped into deep pits and buried where it partially
rots, the outer fermented layer preserving the inner meat!

Beyond the necessary cultivation of foodstuffs to keep the family fed, periods when
no other farming work is possible are spent crafting. A steading has to be capable
of supporting itself, especially in remote regions where traders or even neighbours
rarely visit. Thus the farm hands have to sew their own boots, forge and sharpen tools,
perform carpentry, weave cloth, tailor clothes and so on.

What little spare time remains at the end of each day is spent with smaller handicrafts,
producing nick-knacks or useful items that can be traded for luxuries.

#### Running a Stead in Legend
Whilst steadings are of vital importance as a source of wealth and status, the day-to-day
running of a farmstead is perhaps less than interesting for most players. A Games Master
can use the ownership of a stead as an abstract focus point for scenarios, threatening
its confiscation by lawsuit or destruction in a blood feud, rather than sending the
Adventurers off on another interminable Viking raid.

Yet owning a stead should incur a degree of responsibility, perhaps gaining a reward
for good stewardship. Once each year during the annual thing, the owner may roll
against their Lore (Farming) skill, adjusting for any applicable events on the Farmstead
Productivity table and consult the following:

* **Critical Success**: Indicates that the farmstead has experienced an unusually 
  productive year, earning twice what a successful roll would bring in.
* **Success**: The farmstead turns a profit earning a number of aurar (ounces) of silver
  equal to the value of the adjusted Lore (Farming) skill.
* **Failure**: The farm struggles to remain at a subsistence level of productivity, earning
  no money.
* **Fumble**: Misfortune strikes, the crops rot, some outbuildings burn down or the
  weather was abysmal through the year, causing the stead to lose a number of aurar
  (ounces) of silver equal to 150 minus the value of the unadjusted Lore (Farming) skill.

##### Farmstead Productivity Modifiers

| Reason                                                      | Modifier to Lore (Farming) skill |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Unusually severe winter                                     | –10%                             |
| Owner absent for over a month1                              | –10%                             |
| Owner absent for over half the year1                        | –20%                             |
| Family engaged in an active blood feud                      | –20%                             |
| Region raided by Viking warband or foreign army             | –40%                             |
| Owner declared outlaw*                                      | –40%                             |
| The landvættir (nature spirits) of the farmstead are angry  | Shift success of skill check down by one step |

*These particular modifiers do not stack, only use the worst value.

The amount of silver earned or lost assumes a moderate sized farmstead. Smallholdings,
usually run by bondi, halve the amount of silver involved. Large steadings owned by
the wealthiest hauldr double earnings or losses.


### Settlements
Surprisingly the Vikings develop very few permanent settlements, which reach the size
of towns. The reliance on herding makes high population density settlements difficult
to maintain, save at locations which are the centre of trade or worship.

The small handful of towns are the settling place for professional merchants and
craftsmen, being able to dedicate themselves to their vocation, rather than dabbling on
the side as a tenant farmer. With the wealth they earn from trade the town inhabitants
purchase food and equipment instead of producing it themselves.

Town housing is modest in comparison to the traditional longhouse. Smaller buildings
are sufficient if not needing to house livestock in the winter and since space is at a
premium, they are packed closely together within town walls.

Whether a town is seasonably occupied or not probably depends on the amount and type of
trade that flows through it. Location also has an effect since, for example, the rivers and lakes
around Birka and Uppsala usually freeze during winter, making large scale transportation to
and from there impossible. Some occupants, especially the sailors, are probably seasonally
transient to cater for increased demand of goods during the warmer months.

The earliest towns are all coastal or river based. Overland trade is almost non-existent,
both the difficulty of crossing forested or mountainous terrain and the number of
animals needed to carry significant loads making such journeys uneconomic. Ships
travel faster, carry far greater cargoes and do not require large amounts of feed.

Although built in strategic positions and granted protection by the local jarl or king,
the trading towns remain prime targets for raiding. Most are fortified and maintain a
garrison but often that does not save them.

> 
> - Adam of Bremen

The four major towns of Scandinavia during the Viking period are Hedeby and Ribe
in Denmark, Kaupang in Norway and Birka in Sweden. Despite being primary trading
centres the populations of both Birka and Hedeby remain less than 1,000 people!


### Trade
Of far greater importance than raiding, Viking traders venture widely across the known
world, exchanging their goods for exotic cargos, which are brought back to Scandinavia.
Using the generous capacity of their ships they can turn a profit even if shipping bulk
cargoes of little worth.

Most Scandinavians trade locally, not risking their ships away from the coast or
venturing deep into foreign lands. This is probably due more to practicality rather
than a lack of courage, since most traders are simply a group of local farmers who
gather together their surplus handcrafts or crops and undertake a collective voyage to
exchange their cargo for goods and materials needed on their steads. Few land owners
can remain away from home for an extended period, being needed back home to help
run the farm and prepare for the next winter.

The more adventurous trading expeditions are undertaken by men with no property
or prospects, so set out to seek their fortune elsewhere, managing to reach places like
Byzantium (Miklagard) and beyond.

Each participant in the collective voyage pays for their place and is granted an equal
allotment of cargo space. The captain/owner of the ship is permitted an additional
cargo allowance, filled with trade goods needed to pay for repairs or supplies if the need
arises during the voyage. Thus it acts like a primitive insurance policy.

Every man aboard a trading expedition is expected to help sail the ship, row when
necessary and defend the vessel if attacked by pirates. If someone embarks on a ship
as purely a passenger, then they must pay an extra fee in order to avoid performing
shipboard chores.

Some voyages require an extended amount of time to complete. Expeditions to
Iceland or Greenland depend on the correct currents and winds, necessitating the
ship to overwinter at the destination whilst waiting for the prevailing conditions to
change the following spring. During this time, enterprising crew members seek other
profitable tasks rather than fritter away the trade profit paying for lodgings and food.
Some hire themselves out for labour or bodyguard duty, whereas others attempt
whale or seal hunts.

Likewise, expeditions to Byzantium and the Arabic Caliphates beyond can earn a
staggering amount of wealth but several years can pass on the trip with no guarantee of
success or survival. It takes months to row and portage ships to the Volga or Dnieper
rivers, exposing the crew to the chance of being ambushed or charged exorbitant tolls
en-route. The journey is often so wearisome that many Vikings use the opportunity
to join the Varangian Guard to recuperate or gather together new compatriots to face
the journey home.

The Scandinavians normally barter in trade, preferring to avoid coinage save as
its weight as silver or gold. When trading overseas many Vikings use scales to
determine the worth of coins, no matter what their face value in that land. Coins
or items of jewellery are often cut into pieces to get a precise balance, leading to
the term 'hack silver'.

## Health and Medicine
As a people the Vikings lead a remarkably healthy life. They take pride in their personal
appearance, value hygiene, have a reasonably balanced diet and take pains to avoid
the spread of sickness. Perhaps the most telling signs of their general health is the
fact that they are taller than the average European peasant and are famed for their
handsomeness, which suggests a childhood free of the worst diseases.


### Appearance
Vikings are generally tall, keeping themselves clean and neat of appearance. Men trim
their moustaches and beards but do not normally shave since being beardless is a sign
of immaturity, or worse, effeminacy. Men's hair length can vary between being cut to
the nape of the neck or allowed to grow down to their shoulders. Women however are
forbidden to cut their hair short, that being a male prerogative only.

It is a man's wife who washes and cuts his hair. They use combs to tease out knots and
have a range of other toiletry tools; tweezers, razors, toothpicks and earwax scrapers
for example. Said items are normally made of bone or horn for their ease of shaping,
although wealthy families may possess articles carved from ivory.

Vikings wear clean clothes when possible, carrying spare changes of clean garments
when travelling, although more out of personal pride in their appearance rather than
any deeper knowledge of hygiene. Deliberately dirtying a man by pushing him into (or
casting at him) mud, food, water or urine is a litigious event and severely punished.

Some Rus Vikings are reputed to be tattooed although this habit may be Slavic since
it is not recorded elsewhere in Viking sagas or literature. Tooth decoration however is
practiced amongst the Danes and Swedes. Horizontal grooves are filed into the front
of the teeth as a sign of rank or achievement. These could be filled with coloured wax
to emphasise the effect.



### Personal Hygiene

> 'Combed and washed every thoughtful man should be and fed in the morning;
> for one cannot foresee where one will be by evening;
> it is bad to rush headlong before one's fate.'
> 
> - Havamal

Regular washing is an important part of Viking hygiene. Viking dental health is good,
very few developing tooth decay due to the course food and regular cleaning practices,
as evidenced by toothpicks. Face and hands are expected to be washed before meals,
a good host providing water and towels to guests. Lacking readily available hot water,
most use rivers and pools to wash themselves but this is not practical in the colder
months.

To get really clean Scandinavians use small outbuildings inside which a fire heats
stones. When hot enough, water is poured onto the stones, which bursts into steam.
The vapour not only warms the bathhouse occupants but also condenses onto their
bodies, wetting them without immersion. This combined with natural sweating and
beating oneself with leafy branches, enables the body's pores to extrude all the dirt,
allowing the bather to simply rinse themselves clean with a bucket of cooler water
before drying themselves.

Some Icelandic bathhouses tap into the natural hot springs available in the country,
enabling settlers to bathe and swim even in mid winter, since the water never freezes.

Not everyone shares the Viking enthusiasm for cleanliness. The right to bathe whenever
desired in Byzantium had to be specified in the treaty between the Rus traders and the
city. In fact the overall cleanliness and pride of personal appearance made the Norse
invaders of Britain more attractive to Anglo-Saxon women than their own men folk!

Only those in mourning are exempt from bathing, washing and combing their hair as
a sign of respect to the dead.


### Health and Injury
Most Viking men and women are robust and healthy, guarded from widespread
contagion by the isolation of their steadings. Sanitation is carefully controlled, placing
sewage trenches well away from water sources.

In the few existent Viking towns however, proper sanitation fails to be maintained in
the more densely settled environment. Many inhabitants suffer from intestinal parasites
that spread in the water adjoining the settlements. These cause frequent nausea and
diarrhoea, making urban life less than desirable to most farmers and sailors.

With no actual knowledge of disease and how it functions, the majority of Scandinavian
healers use magic and superstition to treat their patients. Like most of Viking religion,
propitiation is used to avert or ward off disease. If someone does sicken it is a sign that
the spirits are angry or that the person's good luck has deserted them. A jarl or ship
master who does not possess the absolute loyalty of his men can lose his position by
suffering an extended bout of sickness.

Although the Vikings may not know much about epidemics, their ability to treat
wounds is exceptional. In bone-setting especially they are masters, preventing broken
limbs from healing crookedly – often by re-breaking the wound to set the bones
straighter. They also use cauterisation, lancing and the washing out of open wounds to
prevent infection and are very knowledgeable of surgery – removing impaled weapons
such as arrow or spear heads and sewing flesh back together.

> 'Then Snorri the Priest healed all the sons of Thorbrand. But when Thorod's neck grew
> together his head sat somewhat drawn backwards on his trunk, and he said that Snorri
> would heal him into a maimed man. Snorri said that he deemed the head would come
> straight when the sinews were knit together; but Thorod would have nought but that the
> wound should be torn open again, and the head set straighter. But all went as Snorri had
> guessed, and as soon as the sinews were knit together the head came right'
> 
> - Eyrbyggja Saga


Professional healers (læknir) however are a rarity at the start of the Viking Age. Most
healing is done by the women of the stead, so a wife skilled in leech-craft is very highly
valued. Men slowly take over the skills later in the period.

The worst injuries occur in the frequent battles and feuds between Vikings. Mentions
are made of amputations of hands, feet and legs. Disembowelments and splitting open
of bodies are also recounted. However, not all of these dreadful wounds are fatal. Many
a man has the epithet of 'Tree Foot' or similar, indicating a peg leg. In local feuds
womenfolk are present to help treat those suffering what seem to be fatal injuries but
due to careful ministrations the patient often pulls through. In the Laxdaela Saga,
'An Brushwood-Belly' survives being disembowelled. Thorarin in the following excerpt
took an entire summer to heal but did eventually recover from his grievous injury.

> 'It is told too that Halldor, Glum's wife, called on the women to go with her, saying, 'We will
> bind up the wounds of those men who have any hope of life, whichever party they belong to.'
> When she came up Thorarin was just struck down by Marr, his shoulder was cut away in
> such fashion that the lungs were exposed. But Halldor bound up his wound, and kept watch
> over him till the fight was over.'
> 
> - Viga-Glums Saga

Survival into old age is possible for a Viking, although may not be welcomed if they
are a firm believer in Odin and Valhalla. If one can avoid the more deadly diseases
when travelling overseas, win every battle and survive accidents and misfortune, then
reaching your dotage is quite possible, although said person might be half blind, deaf
as a post and be suffering bad arthritis by the end.


## Professions and Crafts
One of the unusual aspects of Viking life is that every farmstead has to be self-
supporting. Trading or purchasing goods normally only occurs during the local thing,
so there is little commercialism to help encourage dedicated professions. The family
running the farm needs to herd animals, plant crops, harvest and preserve food, prepare
firewood, reap hay, erect new buildings, repair tools, provide its own medical care, craft
furniture and crockery, weave its own cloth, supplement its diet with fish or game,
protect itself from raids and so on.

Looking at the list of diverse but necessary skills, it seems that everyone is required to
be a generalist and very few 'professional' craftsmen, healers and the like exist. Whilst
this is fairly accurate for the beginning of the Viking Age, as wealth and productivity
began to increase, the opportunity for professionals grew in step.

A huskarl of an early period jarl might be sworn to service as a warrior but spend most
of his time working in the fields alongside his lord and master. By the end of the Viking
Age however, a wealthy and powerful Norwegian Jarl ruling over a large area could
retain his warriors in his hall, never requiring them to labour physically.

Of course some Vikings own the personal resources or hire themselves out to
specialise in a specific profession. Craftsmen for example can be wandering tinkers
providing their skills to those who will hire them for a season. Otherwise they might
own a small shop in a trading town, manufacturing goods wholesale. Hunters willing
to live a rough seasonal life trapping animals in the forest may return to their family
stead before winter with a small fortune in furs. Warriors can sell their skills as
mercenaries, to the Jomsvikings for example, granted roof and board in exchange for
their sword in battle.

A list of professions is provided in the Viking Adventurers chapter beginning on page 63. 
These mainly reflect the options available in later periods but can easily be used
for less historically accurate games. For campaigns based around the family steading,
it would be wise for a group of players to diversify their skills to take into account the
range of capabilities needed to successfully survive and prosper.


## Leisure and Sport
In their periods of leisure time, Vikings seek entertainment. Whether it is listening to a
poetry recital, engaging in drinking bouts, playing music or singing, testing themselves
playing sports or challenging one another with board games, these diversions help to
pass time, knitting family and society together.

A significant aspect of these entertainments is that most are competitive. Team sports
are based on two groups of family or friends proving who was tougher or better. Even
solo performances are chances for each participant to gain status over his peers. This
unspoken struggle to gain reputation often causes erstwhile friendly competitions to
break down into feuds, even murder.

### Singing, Dancing and Poetry
Singing and dancing are the fundamental forms of entertainment across the Viking
Age world. They require no tools, cross all cultural boundaries and, unless crippled or
mute, everyone is capable of performing either.

In Viking society, in particular, communal singing and dancing can gather together
the folks of outlying steadings, to renew relationships between families or establish
courtships. They are also used to celebrate informal festivities and pay respect at official
ceremonies. There are work songs, bawdy songs and religious songs.

> 'When Odin's toast had been drunk, there was only one more left, the toast dedicated to
> Freyja. Then 'Sigurd' started plucking the one string that lies across the other strings, and
> told the king to get ready for the tune called 'Powerful'. The king was so startled at this tune
> that he jumped to his feet and the bride and the bridegroom too, and nobody danced more
> vigorously than they did.'
> 
> - Bosa Saga


However, solo singing and dancing performances can also be used to demonstrate a
Viking's talent, in order to advance his own reputation or attractiveness to members of
the opposite sex.


> #### The Importance of Social Skills
> 
> In these days of modern recreation it is sometimes difficult for players to understand
> just how vital social skills like singing and dancing are. In the Viking Age there are no
> visual or audio entertainments save for what you yourself can provide. Professional
> entertainers are extremely rare. Actors and plays do not exist. Travelling musicians
> are rare, stringed instruments rarer and ensemble performances rarer still. Books and
> literacy are all but unknown.
> 
> Left with nothing save for their hands, feet and voices, folks sing, dance and recite
> poetry to amuse and enjoy themselves.
> 
> Although often overlooked by many Adventurers, singing and dancing are very useful
> abilities in Viking society. Those that fail to develop a degree of proficiency in these
> important social skills should find themselves lampooned for their lack of ability,
> renowned as a notoriously poor dancer or tone deaf singer; an undesirable situation for
> a Viking who wishes to raise himself in the eyes of his peers.


Games Masters are encouraged to reward Adventurers who advance their entertainment
skills to high degrees of competence. Use Dance or Sing as a test to impress the local Jarl,
help win the heart of a potential future wife or forge bonds with yet unknown allies.
It is often an amusing situation to have an Adventurer celebrated for his mastery of
singing and granted higher fame and status in the hall of a noble, over his companions
who are just ubiquitous slayers of men.



Poetry is the highest art of entertainment. Skalds are renowned as singers but it is their
poetry that is their greatest gift. Poems known as Eddas preserve the mythological tales
of the gods, whereas Sagas record the achievements of heroes and great men. Both types
of poetry beguile the mind with their alliterations and kennings. The skill of a poet lies
not only in the memorisation of thousands of stanzas but also in the ability to compose
witty and evocative verse. Few are able to become true skalds but those who master the
skills are honoured above all men and thought blessed by Odin himself.

With the voice being held in paramount position, instrumental music is less common
in Viking society, possibly due to the limited range of musical instruments available to
them. Whistles, flutes and recorders are carved from elder tree branches or animal leg
bones. Panpipes are made from pieces of boxwood with different length holes drilled
into it. The only stringed instrument known to the Vikings is the lyre, an expensive
item that is limited to the wealthy. Otherwise the only other instruments are the small
hand drum, similar to a bodhran, which probably came from the Lapp peoples to the
north, and the metal ringed rattle.

### Sports
Viking men love playing sports of all kinds, the rougher the better. Whenever a social
gathering occurs, they compete at nearly anything that can be staged as a physical
challenge; Knattleikr (a bat and ball game), glima (wrestling), skating, skiing, swimming,
toga honk (tug-of-war) and weight lifting are just a few of the many they created.
Although most sports occur at the thing or major religious celebrations, sometimes a
games festival is held purely for the pursuit of sporting events.

Like other aspects of their society, the desire to present a manly appearance combined
with a fierce competitiveness leads to many serious injuries and even deaths when
participants take offence at what they consider cheating. The prevalence of unintentional
violence being high, laws place all responsibility on the contestant himself and not the
man who accidentally harms him. Deliberate injuries however, are censured.

Knattleikr is a ball game where two teams face each other, one side strikes the ball and
the other side attempts to either catch and run, or knock back to score. The game
involves full-on tackling but possibly only by a matched opponent on the opposite
team to prevent imbalance due to strength or skill. Bats and players are frequently
broken during the game. Skofuleik is a similar type of game possibly akin to hockey or
hurling.

Glima is Viking wrestling. To win a bout you must first lift your opponent off the ground
and then throw him down so that he fails to land on his feet. Wrestling is popular at the
assemblies since it requires no special equipment (although a padded jacket could be
worn to help protect against broken bones) and is a good demonstration of manliness
and strength. Wrestling indoors should be avoided since landing on a piece of furniture
could be extremely dangerous. In Gunnar's Saga the hero of the story cast down his
opponent onto the raised side bench of the longhouse, breaking his spine!

Most swimming competitions are not races per se but effectively wrestling in water. The
winner is the person who held his opponent under water the longest. Proper swimming
races could either be tests of speed or of endurance – a mythical test of swimming
strength being described near the beginning of Beowulf where he and his friend swam
for many days, still dressed in armour. There were few rules against diabolical tricks,
such as pulling down the trews of a competitor to foul their legs.

Weight lifting challenges are simple tests of brute strength. He who lifts and raises the
heaviest rock is declared the winner. Tug of war is unlike the modern variation where
two teams haul on a long length of rope. Viking toga honk sets two men opposite each
other with bent knees, the soles of their feet pressed together. Both hold onto a small
loop of strong rope and try to pull their opponent over by straightening their legs.

> 
> - Grettir's Saga


The Vikings have other popular games such as skinnleikr a sort of four versus one 'piggy
in the middle' using a rolled up bear ski, although little detail remains about them.


### Games
Scandinavians also enjoy board or dice games, which can be played indoors especially
during the depths of winter. Vikings skilled at these games are either considered very
lucky or cunning minded, both of which are valuable traits for a man who wishes
to become a leader. Indeed board games were so popular that they are often buried
with their owners, presumably to ward of the tedium of death in the underworld. The
boards and game pieces can be very valuable in their own right, finely crafted and made
from materials such as amber, antler, bone, bronze, glass or wood. Dice can be made
from carved wood, bone or animal knucklebones.

Competitiveness and betting on board games can often lead to outbreaks of violence. These
sometimes fatal outbursts are so bad, that in some areas gambling on games is forbidden.

The most famous Viking game is hnefatafl. The objective is to protect or capture a
king piece (hnefi) defended by a small number of retainers, from the opponent's more
numerous army of pieces. Skaktafl (chess) is also known and played, introduced by the
first traders to reach Byzantium and the Middle East.

Drinking games are another popular pastime. Just as with other tests of manliness,
Viking drinking competitions are primarily challenges of personal capacity but differ
however, in that between each draft the participants must compose a verse of poetry
either praising their own personal achievements, or humorously ridiculing those of
their opponent. The winner of the competition is the one who maintains the quality of
his compositions, whilst still able to recite them clearly.

Of course such drinking bouts are avid forms of entertainment for surrounding
observers as the boasts, insults and witticisms grow more outlandish and less restrained
as the drinkers lose their inhibitions under the influence of the alcohol. These types
of drinking games are frowned upon in the Havamal, the edda of wisdom, which
gives many warnings about the dangers of drunkenness – 'A man should drink in
moderation be sensible or silent, none will find fault with your manners though you retire
in good time' –suggests that unless the drinkers were close friends or appreciated good
humour, the disparaging taunts may have started fights or long lasting enmities.

An unusual game is where a man and women are randomly assigned together by lots
as a drinking couple. For the rest of the evening they are supposed to entertain each
other, presumably as an effort to encourage visitors or guests to mix with folks they
would never normally approach, a sort of Viking blind date. Whether it is done for
fun or as a serious attempt to form new married couples is, of course, up to the host
of the celebration.

#### How to Run Competitions
Viking sports and games are an excellent form of non-combat challenges, which can
add a sense of achievement during an adventure. How to model these competitions
using the Legend rules is up to the Games Master.

Short challenges should be resolved in a single dice roll. These are used in scenarios
where there are dozens of simultaneous competitors, such as in a swimming race for
example, or the players intend to enter every event during the session. The competition
is resolved with a simple Opposed Test of the relevant skill. If there is more than one
opponent, then each one (including the Adventurer) gets a single roll and the winner
is determined as normal.

Long challenges are resolved in a series of Skill Tests, three or five steps for instance.
These promote a greater degree of excitement as the competition continues. Long
challenges should be reserved for two participants; otherwise the number of dice rolls
becomes excessive. Each stage of the challenge the Adventurer should test his relevant
skill and gain a number of points based on the Level of Success rolled: Fumble 0 points,
Failure 1 point, Success 2 points and Critical Success 3 points.

The winner of the long challenge is the person with the highest total at the end. If both
competitors have an equal value, then whoever gained the better level of success on
the final round wins. If this too is tied, then it goes to whichever of the two rolled the
highest number on the dice.

Suggested skills to be used for each type of game follows:

| Sport or Game                 | Skill |
|-------------------------------|-------|
| Bat and Ball (Knattleikr)     | Athletics |
| Drinking                      | Combined rolls of Resilience and Poetry, each Resilience failure incurring a cumulative 10% penalty against the Poetry skill |
| Hnefatafl                     | Gaming |
| Skaktafl                      | Gaming |
| Skating                       | Skiing |
| Cross Country Skiing          | Skiing |
| Swimming                      | Swim  |
| Tug of War (toga honk)        | Brawn |
| Weight Lifting                | Brawn |
| Wrestling (Glima)             | Unarmed |

### Horse Fights
Animal fights between wild beasts are something of a rarity in Viking society. Wild
animals, especially carnivores, are hard to trap, transport and keep fed with fresh meat.
Although bear cubs are sometimes traded as potential pets, doing the same with a full
grown bear is not easy. To throw such a creature into a pit against dogs or wolves would
be a tremendous waste of time and effort, for which there would be little remuneration,
since the concept of paying for such spectacles does not exist in Scandinavian society.

The Vikings have a different type of animal baiting, fighting stallions against one
another instead. Horses are easier to control, can be raised on grass and rarely fight to
the death. Since it is often difficult to start two stallions battling each other, they are
provoked with special goad sticks and mares in heat placed upwind in clear sight. In
the sagas it is obvious that the men remain close behind their horse continuing to goad
it until the end. Fights continue until one stallion runs away, is injured too badly to
continue or, occasionally, is killed.

Horse fights are very popular at assemblies but private bouts can also be hosted. Men
often bet heavily on the outcome of a fight. Women are forbidden to attend due to the
frequent arguments and potential violence, which can break out between the spectators.


### Hunting
Another unusual aspect of Viking culture is their approach to hunting. Although
respected as a valued skill, hunting is not entertainment per se, rather a necessity to
gather valuable pelts or fresh meat. Of course, a group of men may treat a hunt as
incidental fun but the objective is not indolent pleasure.

A Viking hunt is rarely performed on horseback. The forests and fells covering much
of Scandinavia make cross country riding hazardous and most of the creatures being
hunted required cover to approach close enough to ambush.

Hunting fearsome animals such as boars or bears on foot is a very dangerous prospect,
as is hunting whales or walruses at sea. Successfully killing a great beast gains the
slayer much reputation for the noteworthy accomplishment, especially if achieved
singlehandedly.

Cruel giants from the frozen northlands, the Vikings are the archetypal pagan
barbarians. Fierce in battle, fearless in war, they voyage the seas looting and raiding,
seeking lands to settle or silver for their wives.

The Vikings are a colourful, exciting culture, with many dynamic possibilities for
conflict and adventure. Their society has classes and ranks, with the ability to rise
from the lowliest thrall to become a jarl or king. They also have many professions and
crafts that can be learned, all of them useful to surviving in harsh climates or emerging
victorious from the field of battle.

A fascinating aspect of Viking life are their polytheistic beliefs, even Christianised
Vikings still make offerings to the spirits of their steads and pray to Thor, even if
attending church regularly. Magic and superstition resounds in Viking culture, with its
curses, wyrds, chants and runes.

As described in the previous chapter, Viking personality is not limited to what we
consider socially acceptable today. A Viking can be domineering, cruel, treacherous
or even stupid and get away with it, as long as they hold the loyalty of their personal
community or have the warrior skills to back it up. Of course, alienating everyone can
result in being declared an outcaste but many sagas show the dramatic lives of those
whose belligerence or aggression would never be tolerated in more civilised lands.

In conclusion, Vikings present the perfect culture for warrior-adventurers. Whether
motivated by greed, vengeance, ambition or simply a desire to seek out the unknown
– a Viking makes the perfect Legend Adventurer!


## Creating a Viking Adventurer
The checklist for creating a Viking Adventurer is as follows:

* Select the culture from which the Adventurer comes. If the Games Master allows,
  Adventurers can be from cultures other than those traditional for a Viking, maybe
  being a savage Bulgar, mysterious Lapp or fractious Hibernian. For those wishing
  to play a more mythic style of campaign, an Adventurer can be a semi divine Æsir,
  Vanir or even Jotunn.
* Roll the appropriate Characteristics.
* Determine the background skills based on the Adventurer's culture.
* Roll for the Adventurer's social rank. The Games Master may allow the Adventurers
  to choose their rank or impose one to suit their campaign.
* Determine the Adventurer's profession. Again, if desired, the Games Master may
  allow players to choose a profession that suits their concept.
* If a magic using profession, determine the type of magic known, referring to the
  Viking Magic chapter if necessary.
* Roll on the Family Ties and Family Reputation tables in the Legend Core Rulebook.
* Roll on the Viking Background Events table.
* Allocate the Free Skill Points to remaining skills and to buy new Advanced Skills.
* If playing in a mythic campaign, grant the Adventurer a roll on the 'Divine Gift' 
  table.


## Viking Characteristics

> 'I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the Volga. I
> have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blonde and ruddy'
> 
> - The Risala of Ahmad ibn Fadlān

Adventurers, depending on race or culture, use different dice rolls to generate their
Characteristics from the normal method in the Legend Core Rulebook. Although
this may appear somewhat unfair or unbalanced, Games Masters can prevent player
dissatisfaction by ensuring that Adventurers in their campaigns all come from the
same origin.


### Scandinavians
Many of the sagas and historical documents recounting the Vikings suggest that
they were often men of unusual strength, size and beauty in comparison with their
contemporaries from other parts of Europe. This was probably due to their healthier
diet and lifestyle. Rural living in isolated steadings helped too, since diseases, which
often stunted growth, tended to be rife in towns and cities.

To reflect their general health and vigour, the Norwegians, Danes, Swedes and Rus use
the following Characteristics.

### Western Europeans
These include the English, Scots, Hibernians, Franks and so on. Whilst feudalism has
yet to take a stranglehold during this period, most of the population still maintain a
reasonable standard of living. In these cultures members of the noble class may, with
the Games Master's permission, use Viking Characteristics instead, reflecting their
better nutrition and upbringing.

### Eastern Europeans
This category mainly covers the peoples of the far north and east of Europe and the
Balkans, such as the Lapps, Finns, Kurs, Wends, Bulgars and Khazars. Most of these
people tend to be smaller than average due to a nomadic lifestyle, poverty or living in
disease ridden urban environments. As mentioned previously, members of the noble
class may, with the Games Master's permission, use European Characteristics instead,
reflecting the advantages of a better lifestyle.

### Asians
These are the peoples of Byzantium and those from the Arab Caliphates. Use the same
Characteristics as for Eastern Europeans.


### Mythic Races
Some campaigns can be heroic games set during the times of the gods and giants. In
such mythic campaigns players would be able to play members of the Aesir, Vanir,
Jotnar or their offspring. Many mythological heroes were thought to be descendants
of the gods; the most famous among them were Volsung, Sigurd the Dragon-slayer;
Helgi Thrice-Born, Harald Wartooth, Hadding and Starkad.

The following Characteristics reflect heroes and deities; as such they should not be used
for straight historical campaigns, unless the Games Master wishes to give the players a
distinct advantage or has fated the Adventurers to be legendary heroes.

Divine Adventurers are assumed to be of noble rank and Viking culture and should be
allowed to choose their profession.


### Æsir or Vanir
The Æsir and Vanir are the divine races of the gods of war and fertility.

### Jotnar
The Jotnar are the race of giants and monsters that live in Jotunheim. Adventurers in
mythic campaigns who wish to be a Jotun can either choose a giant form, as described
here, or a monstrous animal form as described on page 200 of the Viking Creatures
chapter.

Although some giants are portrayed as huge, such as the frost giants (hrimthursar), fire
giants (eldjotnar) and mountain giants (bergrisar), most are only modestly bigger than
human size; being able to share furniture and sire children with the Æsir and Vanir.

> #### Combat Styles
> 
> The common weapons of the Viking ages were generally simple swords, spears, axes and
> shields. Few exotic weapons existed, although some might be available to Adventurers
> who journey to Byzantium.
> 
> Use the following weapons, either singularly or in combination, as Viking Combat
> Styles. This book assumes a default of one two-handed or two single-handed weapons
> per style but Games Masters may freely include as many as is fitting for his campaign
> – a Danish warrior could have Danish Raider style, which incorporates Axe, Daneaxe,
> Shield and thrown Spear under a single skill for example.
> 
> **Close Combat**: Axe, Club, Daneaxe, Glaive (Atgeirr), Knife, Shield, Shortsword (Seax),
> Spear, Sword, Unarmed  
> **Ranged Combat**: Axe, Bow, Sling, Spear, Thrown Stone
> 
> Note that these weapons are only culturally relevant for Scandinavians. Other cultures
> may have less access to expensive items like swords or specialise in different weapons
> such as lances.



## Social Ranks
The cultures of the Viking Age are universally class based societies. Although some class
mobility is possible, starting Adventurers should either roll to see what social class they
were born into or be assigned one by the Games Master.

An Adventurer's access to certain professions is based upon their birth. Due to space
limitations, specific ranks are only given for Vikings. With a little work a Games Master
could fill in the equivalent ranks for the multitude of other cultures present at this time.

##### Social Class and Rank

| Roll 1D100 | Class | Viking Ranks | Professions | Wealth Multiplier* |
|------------|-------|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 01–05 | Criminal or Exile | Outlaw | Beggar, Magician, Outlaw, Seer, Shaman, Sorcerer, Thief | x 0.25 |
| 06–25 | Slave | Leysing Thrall | Craftsman, Farmer, Fisherman, Herdsman | x 0.5 |
| 26–80 | Peasant | Bondi Hauldr Karr | Craftsman, Farmer, Fisherman, Herdsman, Hunter, Huskarl, Skald, Trader, Warrior | None |
| 81–00 | Noble | Jarl Landsmann | Explorer, Godi, Noble | x5 |

*When determining starting money, adjust the value of silver by the wealth multiplier.


## Professions
Use the following professions depending on the Adventurer's Social Rank or Cultural
Background. Most folk in this period tend to be generalists, since there are few
opportunities to devote oneself to scholarly pursuits. For more civilised cultures such as
Byzantium or the Arab Caliphates, the Games Master may allow other more specialised
professions from the Legend Core Rulebook to be used.

**Beggar**: Beggars in Scandinavian lands are not the archetypal street layabouts of more
civilised lands. Instead they are more akin to dispossessed itinerant workers, who
exchange hard labour for hospitality. Although they have little status, they are often the
source of entertainment or adventure, Odin in particular favours the role of begging
wanderer when travelling Midgard.

**Craftsman**: Whilst most folk know a craft, some work as dedicated manufacturers of
goods. These can be smiths, ship builders, leather workers, glass blowers, wood carvers
and so on. Since most people in a small Viking community tend to make their own
gear, most professional craftsmen are located in the few major trading settlements,
where travelling traders are more likely to purchase their wares.

**Explorer**: Realistically there are few 'professional' explorers during the Viking Age.
However, a few travellers such as Leif Eriksson seem driven by wanderlust to seek out
new places and founding colonies. Viking explorers need not necessarily search out
uninhabited lands. They could form new trade links to the Middle East or even Africa!

**Farmer**: By far the most common Viking occupation, farming is the foundation that
pays for raiding or trading trips overseas. Most steads are small communities in their
own right, with dozens of workers to herd, till, reap and preserve in order to survive
the generally harsh winters. The highest objective for most farmers is to own their own
land and raise a family, which can support them in their dotage, if they are unfortunate
enough to survive into old age.

**Fisherman**: The Baltic seas are famed for their herring, which Swedes and Danes catch
to supplement their diet. The Norse however, locked in fjords with little arable land, are
more dependent on fish, which they smoke or dry on racks to preserve it. Fishermen go
whaling too during the migrating season. Most Viking fishermen use small skiffs that
look like tiny two or three man longships and sail far offshore. Inland fishermen go ice
fishing in the winter, cutting holes in the ice to lower baited lines.

**Godi**: Local leaders of the community, Godi are actually more akin to judges rather than
priests. Although they supervise religious ceremonies and make sacrifices, their chief
purpose is to host community assemblies (things), present heralds and settle legal disputes.

**Herdsman**: Shepherds, goatherds, cowherds and swineherds, who free their flocks into
the wilderness or up hillsides in the spring and summer, then gather them in late
autumn and return to winter quarters before the snows arrive. Herdsmen are more
prevalent in the Norse regions where there is more grazing land, rather than arable
land. In northern Scandinavia the Lapps herd reindeer, which are the only livestock
able to survive outdoors in the winter cold.

**Hunter**: A primary way of life for many Finns and Lapps, many Vikings also hunt in
the deep forests of their homelands. Hunters gather fresh meat for consumption and
furs for trading. They also keep down the number of dangerous animals in an area,
such as wolves or bears. Hunters are not limited to land animals. In the north they
often hunt seals or even whales once the ice is thick enough to support weight.

**Huskarl**: A professional Viking warrior who joins a noble's household. Huskarls are
expected to be able to fight, wrestle, swim and travel by ship. In return for swearing
loyalty they are fed and sheltered by their lord.

**Noble**: The secular leaders of society, a Viking noble is generally a Landmann, Jarl or
King. Whilst some are renowned warriors in their own right, the primary concern of
a noble is to maintain the stability and protection of his people. Since in early Viking
culture such authority is based on popular acclaim, rather than hereditary inheritance,
detested nobles are usually driven off and wealthy ones killed for their possessions.

**Outlaw**: Outlaws are members of society who have had the protection of the law
stripped from them. Generally the result of a serious crime, an outlaw can be killed,
tortured or mutilated without censure. Thus it is in an outlaw's best interest to flee the
region and seek out new lands where his name and deeds are unknown.

**Seer**: Many Viking folk have the incidental power of foresight but a seer has the ability
to call upon divination (spa) at will. Both feared and respected due to their strange
ability to view the wyrd of those who request a foretelling; seers are often held outside
of society, law and authority have no hold upon them.

**Shaman**: Shamanism is common amongst the Lapps where it is rightly feared for its
power over nature and the ability to curse those who threaten them. They can project
their spirit into animals or the forms of animals to do their will.

**Skald**: The most respected profession within Viking society, a skald is a poet, historian,
storyteller and singer. Skalds entertain by recounting epic tales or presenting wry
commentary. Fine singers and public speakers, skalds often take up permanent positions
in the courts of powerful men, immortalising their battles and deeds as skaldic poems.

**Sorcerer**: A Viking sorcerer is a worker of magic, either sung charms (seidr) or rune
carving. Although Odin himself was said to use seidr, it is normally considered a female
art and rather unmanly. Conversely, rune carving is largely the province of men.

**Thief**: Full time thieves do not really exist within rural Viking society, the population
density being too low to support a criminal class. A thief could be a travelling brigand
or live in one of the large trade towns but most 'thieves' are probably opportunistic
wanderers that help themselves to food, clothing or tools. Viking locks exist in this
period, so theft is a fear even if only by a stead's own thralls.

**Trader**: Viking traders use boats or ships to travel the rivers and seas that are the roads
of the Viking Age. Cautious traders stick to safer, well known routes – but large profits
are available to traders willing to risk long journeys into unknown territory.

**Warrior**: This professional warrior class is presented for non-Viking cultures. It can be
used for Frankish Knights or Saxon Fyrdsmen.


> #### New Skills
> 
> A number of new skills have been introduced for this setting and are described here.
> For the magic skills of Rune Carving, Seidr, Shamanism and Spa please refer to the
> Viking Magic Chapter.
> 
> ##### Gaming (Int x 2)
> This skill allows the playing of board games such as the Viking game of Hnefatafl or
> chess (Skaktafl). Most people know the rules to these games but additional proficiency
> indicates a better grasp of the tactics and strategy involved to play them. To resolve the
> winner of a game simply use an Opposed Test of each Adventurer's Gaming skill.
> 
> ##### Poetry (Int+Cha)
> Poetry is the primary form of artistic entertainment in Viking culture. The skill covers
> several aspects of poetry. Firstly the memorisation of Eddas and Sagas – the mythological
> tales and historic deeds of heroes. Secondly it allows the user to compose skaldic poetry
> on the spot, creating beautiful sounding and thoughtful stanzas about something the
> poet has just witnessed or wishes to comment on. Thirdly it demonstrates the quality
> of a rendition, ensuring the alliteration and meter is correct. The skill can be used to
> remember a historical or mythological fact, create a pleasing poem, or stage a pleasing
> public performance.
> 
> ##### Skiing (Con+Dex)
> The Skiing skill covers all forms of foot travel over snow and ice. Hence it is also
> used for skating, which is generally used less often in northern Scandinavia due to the
> amount of snow that normally covers the ice. Anyone with this skill can automatically
> ski or skate with no need to make a Skill Test unless they are faced with a challenging
> situation, such as passing a dangerous obstacle or engaging in a pursuit. The skill also
> covers the efficient use of snow shoes, allowing wearers to ignore fatigue loss tests if
> they can make a successful Skiing roll.


### Magical Skills
If the Adventurer is a sorcerer or shaman, then they should start the game with three
powers, chants or spirits, suitable to the magical skill they have chosen.


### Family Ties, Reputation and Connections
Family is very important in Viking society. Generally your family are those who will
protect you, perhaps even after becoming an outcaste. They are also the people who
will seek vengeance for your death, so a large number of healthy brothers are often
valuable as a deterrent – or a source of new Adventurers if your current one dies. Sisters
given in marriage can be a powerful bond between families, creating alliances that can
be called upon in times of strife.

Conversely some family members can be a damning liability. An Adventurer may
come from a family of ill reputation, forcing him to constantly struggle when people
discover his name. Relations of a known murderer or thief can have legal cases drawn
against them, or be butchered by the dead man's own relatives seeking justice in a blood
feud. Many of the Viking sagas centre on the thirst for vengeance or justice for deeds
committed against their family, thus the ties that an Adventurer has with his relations
are a powerful motivating force in an ongoing campaign.

To determine an Adventurer's family ties, reputation and connections, follow the
guidelines in the Legend Core Rulebook.


### Background Events
Life is harsh in the Viking Age. Many terrible deeds or omens can occur in an
Adventurer's life before they set forth in the world. Sometimes, however, the fate
woven by the Norms can instead grant a bountiful and sheltered upbringing. The
following table lists a multitude of Viking specific incidents, which may have moulded
an Adventurer during his upbringing.

Games Masters are encouraged to allow players several rolls on the table. The events
can be used as personality guidelines or motivations for starting Adventurers, until they
have found their feet in the storyline of the campaign. Some entries may not be suitable
for foreign Adventurers of non-Viking origin. If something incongruous comes up,
either re-roll the event or use the Background Events table in the Legend Core Rulebook.

Adventurers can select a Divine Gift from page 133 of the Viking Religion chapter.


## Viking Names
The last step before buying equipment is to name the Adventurer. Vikings usually have
two names. The first is their personal name, by which close friends and acquaintances
call them. The second is their patronymic, which is based upon adding the suffix of
–son or –dotter to the father's name. Ulf Eriksson would mean Ulf son of Erik for
instance.

Since some names are quite popular, to distinguish specific individuals Vikings
often used bynames (nicknames) or the place where they came from to grant a more
unique identifier. Quite often the nickname can be quite sarcastic or derogatory. It
is used after the personal name, sometimes separated by the word 'the' depending on
the adjective.

Adventurers should select, or perhaps even roll, for their name and their father's
name from the following table. It is recommended that starting Viking Adventurers
withhold selecting a nickname, since it is more atmospheric and rewarding to be
granted one during a campaign by a notable personage, in recognition of some
mighty deed.

The possessions of a Viking are varied and many. Every Viking raider worth his salt
needs his axe and spear, helm and shield. A stead-bound bondi on the other hand might
only own his herd of milk cows. Viking women long for jewellery to accentuate their
desirability and the men can be dandies if brightly dyed cloth falls into their hands.

The number and quality of a Viking's goods are important, not only as personal wealth
but to improve their status in the eyes of others. However the goods available to the
Vikings are somewhat limited compared to those listed in the Legend Core Rulebook,
some items are beyond the technology of the time to produce or are simply unnecessary
for day-to-day living.

Listed in the following sections are common Viking goods and some optional rules
concerning their use. Games Masters need not restrain themselves to just these; after
all, items manufactured outside of Scandinavia could turn up as plunder from a
raiding trip or be discovered in the hoard of some ancient monster. Due to the limited
availability of goods, some items are treasured heirlooms passed from father to son.


## The Availability of Goods
Save for the few trading towns in Scandinavia, there are no such thing as shops. This
is a very important concept – if you lack something you must either make it yourself,
steal it, or wait until the thing and hope some itinerate trader has one on offer.

If an item is not available at the thing market, a Viking can place an order with a trader
requesting that he brings one the next time he travels to the region. A desperate man
can even undertake a journey to one of the trade towns in the hope of finding what he
wants there.

Another concept important to the setting is that there is no mass production. Each item
is individually hand crafted and uniquely decorated. Since folk own so few possessions,
stealing an item risks the chance of its recognition by the victim of the crime, or his
close friends and family. Looting a dead body is tantamount to broadcasting your guilt
if the thief attempts to use or barter the articles in that area.

Both of these considerations can be used as the basis for adventure. Where has Snorri
been for the last two weeks and why does Arngrim have his ivory hilted knife? No
chainmail hauberks here but if you sail to Birka, only a voyage of a week, my brother
sells armour from the stall with the red and white striped awning...

In reality most items needed for day-to-day survival and comfort are made by people
themselves. Folk living on a stead will often carve their own furniture, sew their own
shoes, forge their own metal tools and even build their own ships. It is the specialist
items such as fine woven cloth, swords, armour, glassware or jewellery that require
a dedicated craftsman to manufacture. These goods are expensive and often hard to
locate without the right contacts.

If using the 'Running a Stead in Legend' rules, it might appear that a landowner has
plenty of money to purchase anything wanted from these lists. There are some things
to consider, however. Many years a farmer will fail to earn any income from their
steading and whatever profit is earned, needs to be distributed amongst the entire
family; wives and brothers not granted a share for their labours will grow increasingly
discontent. Also fines levied by the thing can quickly eat up funds, especially if paying
compensation for insults, wounds or weregild.

Games Masters who find their Adventurers awash with wealth can encourage them to
purchase better quality items than the bog standard versions listed. A basic sword may
cost 1 Mark of silver but one with gold inlay and gems inset into the hilt could easily
quadruple the price, gaining the bearer additional fame and reputation.


> #### Displaying One's Wealth
> 
> If a Viking acquires items of great value, such as fine silk clothing or a gold arm ring for
> example, wearing such articles can add to his influence. A wealthy man either has great
> luck or the skill to defend himself from others who would strip it from him.
> 
> Games Masters are encouraged to grant Adventurers who spend large amounts of
> wealth, on such things, a situational bonus to their Commerce, Influence, Oratory and
> Seduction skills. The size of the bonus depends on who is being influenced and the
> ambient level of wealth.
> 
> Thus a warrior dripping with silver, dressed in brightly dyed clothing and bearing a
> gold inlaid sword might gain a +40% bonus in the home of a poor karl, perhaps only
> +20% at the steading of a well-off hauldr and nothing in the great hall of a jarl where
> such levels of ostentation are expected.
> 
> Conversely if the warrior is a freedman with nothing to his name but the undyed
> homespun clothes on his back and a rickety old spear, he would gain no bonus in the
> home of the karl; a –20% penalty at the hauldr's stead and –40% in the jarl's great hall
> where the word of the poor man would carry little influence.


## Bartering for Goods
Vikings do not use money for transactions. Coinage is viewed only as small ingots of
precious metal of variable quality. Goods or services are bartered, precious metals only
being used for high value purchases or when a person needs to travel without weighing
themselves down with trade items.

Fortunately Scandinavians understand the concept of exchange rates, providing a
rough conversion value for most items in order to prevent runaway inflation. The
value of goods is usually rated in ounces of silver or its equivalent of woven cloth or
standard cloth.

An eyrir, plural aurar, was a unit of weight, approximately 27 grams, used for measuring
precious metals. A logeyrir is a length of homespun cloth (vadmal) six ells long and two
ells broad. Since an ell is about 50 centimetres, this translates to an area of woollen fabric
three metres long and one metre wide. The reason for this comparison is that it gives
a good idea of how much silver is worth, since one eyrir is equivalent to the combing,
carding, spinning and weaving of a logeyrir of cloth – perhaps a week of hard work.

For most of the Viking Age one logeyrir remains about the equivalent of an eyrir of
silver; which in turn is equal to one milk cow. Almost everything in Scandinavia is
valued in terms of lengths of fabric, weight in silver or number of cows.

For the sake of simplicity, the equipment listed in this chapter is given a base price in
silver. The weights used are pennies, aurar or marks of silver. A penny is equivalent to
the amount of silver in an Arabic dirham, about 10 pennies equalling an eyrir. A mark
is eight aurar of silver or 80 pennies. Gold, if ever encountered in quantity, is worth
eight times its equivalent weight in silver. A man carrying too much debased silver
coinage or hacked up jewellery will often have a smith melt it down to form pure silver
ingots equal to a mark in weight.

When engaging in trade a Viking might face difficulties if he cannot offer goods or
services useful to the seller. Although this is taken into account when trading at the
local thing, since folks tend to produce items or surpluses that they know will be in
demand by the inhabitants of the region, it is another matter altogether if sailing
overseas to negotiate trade with foreigners. Offering nomadic Lapps delicate, high
quality glassware for their furs is probably going to fail.

Bartering deals might involve multiple goods in the same transaction. For example, a
cargo of bear, wolf and reindeer skins might require half a dozen iron knives, three blue
dyed tunics, a carved wooden bed, 10 metres of rope, 20 leather belts and a skin of fine
wine in exchange.


## Armour
Vikings do not possess a large range of protective armour. What exists is generally
limited in availability and if made from iron, prohibitively expensive. Poorer Vikings
normally rely on just a large shield and perhaps a leather helmet for protection, few
but the wealthiest land owners can afford to outfit themselves and their men with
chainmail byrnies.

Beyond leather clothing, armour is not normally worn on a daily basis, even by the
huskarls of a jarl, due to its weight and encumbrance. Instead it is stored in chests and
only brought out when the owner expects trouble, such as when a threat is made against
his life or outlaws have been reported in the area. Vikings who depart overseas, whether
for trading or raiding, generally take their armour with them carefully wrapped and
stored against moisture, only to be removed just before it will be needed.

Although most armour is a valuable commodity, it is almost never looted from the dead.
The Vikings are very superstitious about taking armour and weapons from corpses,
believing such items are cursed (jewellery and other items are fine however). Of course
sly Adventurers can take these items and try to resell them to merchants who specialise
in armaments. Armour, however, usually shows signs of its use. Bloodstained leather
or freshly broken rings are a giveaway of looted armour, causing most Scandinavian
merchants to avoid contact with it at all costs unless the seller can come up with a
convincing lie as to its origin and current condition. Failing to do so can cause the seller
to gain a reputation as a grave robber, causing the gradual loss of friends and associates.


#### Looted Armour
Due to the inescapable superstition concerning grave goods, an Adventurer who
knowingly dons a suit of looted armour will find it cursed. In purely historical
campaigns the Adventurer merely suffers from a psychosomatic effect driven by his
guilt. In fantasy Viking campaigns the curse is real. No matter the source the effects are
identical and only cease if the accursed item is discarded.

| 1D6 Roll   | Type of Curse |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | Armour betrays the wearer – Armour Points are halved. |
| 2          | Armour brings nightmares – wearer suffers a constant Fatigue Level of Winded due to lack of sleep. |
| 3          | Armour burdens conscience – the Armour Penalty of the looted item is doubled. |
| 4          | Armour constricts wearer – wearer loses one of his Combat Actions each round due to snagging or tightness. |
| 5          | Armour dooms its wearer – whilst worn all Resilience tests automatically fail. |
| 6          | Armour hinders flight – the base Movement Rate of the wearer when running is halved. |


### Armour Descriptions
The following types of armour are specific to the Viking period and vary slightly
to armour in the Legend Core Rulebook due to different materials or manufacturing
techniques. They are considered to already include any necessary padding or
undergarments and cannot be layered.

**Bearskin**: Literally the cured skin of a bear draped over the torso and arms of the
wearer and tied in place. The bear's head can be worn over the wearer's skull to act as
a helmet.

**Byrnie**: Also known as a brynja, a byrnie is a tunic or coat of armour that covers from
the shoulders to the groin and extends down to the elbows.

**Cap**: A cap is a form fitting hat, which protects the top, back and sides of the head,
down to the ears.

**Coif**: A hood made of mail.

**Hauberk**: A hauberk is the same as a byrnie but longer, hanging down to the knees and
covering more of the arms, extending to mid-forearm or wrist. Due to the additional
coverage it is usually slightly more encumbering.

**Hood**: An article that completely covers the head and shoulders, leaving only the face
exposed.

**Lamellar**: Lamellar is formed from hundreds of overlapping plates called lames, which
are laced together to make a thick protective layer that has some degree of flexibility.
Individual lames are made from a variety of materials from iron, horn or thick rawhide
but provide the same protection.

**Mail**: Mail is a fabric-like mesh made from thousands of small interlaced metal rings.
Each ring joins to four others and is riveted closed, making it very flexible but difficult
to break. Making mail requires a lot of iron and time, making it very expensive.

**Quilted**: Fabric armour made from many layers of wool stitched together. Sometimes
a stuffing of hair is used to reduce the amount of fabric layers. The resulting thick
sandwich provides reasonable protection but is prone to being cut, requiring a lot of
maintenance to remain useful.

**Reindeer/Seal Skin**: Reindeer hides are used by the Lapps to make their armour and
are sometimes traded south. The protection is usually minimal but Reindeer Skin has
the advantage that it can be easily decorated. Lapp Wizards are famed for enchanting
reindeer skin with sigils and chants to make it impervious to harm. Sealskin clothes are
worn by Norwegian and Icelandic Vikings for warmth, rather than protection.

**Shirt**: A shirt indicates an item of light protective value that fully covers the chest,
abdomen and arms of the wearer.

**Spangenhelm**: A rigid helmet that covers the same parts of the head as a cap but
includes a nasal bar and sometimes cheek flaps to protect the face. They are formed
from sections of metal riveted together.

**Trews**: Another word for trousers.

**Vendel Helm**: As per a Spangenhelm, except the nasal bar is extended with an ocular
to better protect the eyes or completely replaced by a full face mask. The neck and face
are further guarded with a mail aventail.

## Weaponry
Although the range and variation of Viking weapons is very limited, the handful
adopted seem to fulfil their needs more than adequately. Due to the costs of bog or
forged iron, most Vikings use cheaper weapons that require little metal to manufacture,
such as spears and axes.

Metal weapons are very expensive, not only in terms of iron required but the skill
needed to forge them. The quality and size of Iron ingots available to Vikings is
often poor, requiring pattern welding to build up a large enough billet and ensure a
reasonably good blade free from flaws. However, the manufacture of pattern welded
billets requires hours of folding and forge-welding the metal, losing much of the iron
in the process. Swords, spears and knifes are made from pattern welded steel.

Weapons that emerge from the forge unusually hard or resistant to damage are often
named and passed down within families for several generations. Weapons are buried
with their last owner if he fell in battle. Some blades however are so famous and deadly
that foolish men seek to recover them from the grave. Akin to armour, looting the
weapon of a dead man invariably brings a curse and whilst the weapon may still be
effective in combat, it will always betray its thief in the end.

#### Looted Weapons
Use the following curses for a weapon looted from a dead man. Similar to looted
armour, it is the weapon itself that is accursed, not its wielder. The psychosomatic or
magical effects cease if the weapon is abandoned.

| 1D6 Roll   | Type of Curse |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | Weapon becomes kin-slayer – every fumble that occurs whilst using the weapon, results in it striking the nearest friend in a random location for full damage, ignoring armour. Lacking a suitable target it injures the wielder instead. |
| 2          | Weapon blunted in combat – the damage rolled for the weapon in a successful attack is halved, although any Damage Bonus is not affected. |
| 3          | Weapon brings nightmares – wearer suffers a constant Fatigue Level of Winded due to lack of sleep. |
| 4          | Weapon dooms its wielder – the bearer's wounds fail to heal naturally. |
| 5          | Weapon turns in grip – any disarm attempt against the wielder automatically succeeds and fumbles in combat default to Drop Weapon. |
| 6          | Weapon weighs heavily – wielder loses one of his Combat Actions each round due to the weapon feeling heavy and unwieldy. |


### Close Combat Weapon Descriptions

**Axe**: A single-bladed weapon with a sturdy haft and a small iron head, the axe is
normally used as a singlehanded weapon. If using both hands the damage dice is
increased one step to 1D8+1. An axe can be used to bash through doors and obstacles
rather quickly. It suffers no damage when attacking inanimate wooden objects.

**Club**: Although seemingly incongruous in the Viking Age clubs are very popular
weapons in some of the sagas where foes are immune to the bite of iron. A champion
often has to flee battle in order to cut himself a hefty club, which he then uses to pound
the magically protected enemy to death. Lapps and Inuit peoples often have clubs
fashioned with alternate materials such as stone or whalebone, and even an icicle, if
large enough, can be used as a one-shot club. If two hands are used to wield a club, then
the damage of the weapon is increased by one dice step to 1D8.

**Dane Axe**: A single headed axe blade mounted on a shaft up to two metres in length,
the Dane axe is a two handed weapon of terrible destructive power. Wielded by a strong
man, it is capable of sheering off the leg of a horse in a single blow. Like a normal axe
it also suffers no damage when used to break inanimate wooden objects.

**Glaive**: Known as an atgeirr the Viking glaive is effectively a sword mounted on a
long haft. These are quite popular weapons in the sagas, since an enemy is often
incapacitated with a single blow and it is capable of puncturing chain byrnies. Glaives
require two hands to wield.

**Halberd**: Called a kesja, Viking halberds are similar to the weapons used later in the
Middle Ages. The axe head is combined with a thrusting tip and a hook, mounted on
a long shaft. Halberds require both hands to wield. Halberdiers are versatile opponents
that can bring any version of the weapon's attack to bear in an instant.

**Knife**: Knives can be made from a sharp piece of metal, stone or bone. Viking knives
have decorated hilts of wood or ivory carved with patterns. Seen as a tool rather than a
weapon, a knife is a multi-purpose item that everyone in society carries, even the thralls.

**Seax**: The Scandinavian seax is a straight, single-edged shortsword with a distinctive
point that can be used to hack or thrust. The seax is the ubiquitous sidearm of karls
who cannot afford a sword.

**Spear**: Viking spjot are singlehanded weapons designed to be used in combination with
shields. If two hands are used then the damage of the weapon is increased by one dice
step to 1D10+1. Spears are designed to be thrown but have a very short range. Spear
heads are relatively cheap in comparison to swords and are often traded. Most free men
own a spear, which they use when hunting or to defend their stead.

**Sword**: The prince of weapons, Viking swords are a status symbol of wealth and
authority. The majority of early Viking swords are double edged blades less than a
metre long and have rounded tips making it impossible to thrust with them. Owners
often name their blades and have them decorated with precious metals. Due to their
tight hilts Viking swords cannot be used two handed.

**Viking Shield**: A large circular shield designed for foot combat. Its generous surface
area provides excellent coverage but its construction from thin wood makes it fragile,
enabling powerful blows to quickly shatter it. Most are reinforced with metal edging
and commonly have some form of pattern or insignia painted on the outside face.

> #### New Combat Manoeuvres
> Some of the combat descriptions in the sagas offer up some interesting new tactics to
> those trained in their use. The following manoeuvres are designed to emulate these
> techniques.
> 
> **Cast Back (Defensive, Critical Success Only)** – The recipient of a thrown weapon
> attack can snatch the weapon out of the air, spin in place and throw it back at the
> original thrower. This costs the user of the manoeuvre no additional Combat Actions
> beyond the one spent to parry in the first place. In addition it also voids whatever
> damage the missile attack would have normally inflicted. If the user is currently
> wielding two weapons and does not have a free hand, they can decide to drop one of
> the weapons as part of this manoeuvre, to allow the initial catch. This manoeuvre does
> not work against projectile weapons such as arrow or sling stones and common sense
> should be applied if the thrown object is particularly large or awkward.
> 
> **Shield Bash (Offensive)** – Works like the Bash Opponent manoeuvre, except that
> the opponent is knocked backwards by one metre per point of damage inflicted by the
> shield (including any damage bonus). In addition the force of the blow is sufficient
> to require the opponent to make the Difficult Athletics Skill Test without needing an
> obstacle to trip over.
> 
> **Shield Twist (Defensive)** – Whilst parrying, the wielder of a Viking Shield may allow
> an attacking weapon to lodge deeply into the wood. From that moment on, the lodged
> weapon is automatically considered to be suffering the Pin Weapon Combat Manoeuvre.
> However, this is just the set-up. The user of the shield can spend the Combat Action of
> their next turn to make an automatic Disarm Opponent attempt, treating the shield as
> an entangling weapon. Whilst a weapon remains lodged in it, attempts to parry with
> the shield suffer a –20% penalty.


### Ranged Weapon Descriptions
**Short Bow**: Designed to be fired from horseback, the short bow is equally useful as a
foot soldier's weapon. It is a good hunting tool as well as a weapon of war and when
used to hunt deer and smaller game animals it can make all the difference.

**Sling**: A sling is a long strip of cloth or leather used to fling a stone or bullet at a target.
It is as lethal as a bow, able to injure or kill those wearing heavy armour. Many slings
also have a sewn-in leather cup or pad in which to hold the projectile while gathering
velocity. A sling's range makes it useful against archers.

**Throwing Axe**: Originally a Frankish invention, the Vikings inherited throwing axes
from the continent. Shaped to increase the chance of the blade striking rather than the
haft, a throwing axe is of little use against well armoured foes.

**Thrown Anvil**: Just for fun...

> 'Vigfus, a son of Vigaglum, took up an anvil with a sharp end, which lay upon the deck, and
> on which a man had welded the hilt to his sword just before, and being a very strong man
> cast the anvil with both hands at the head of Aslak Holmskalle, and the end of it went into
> his brains. Before this no weapon could wound this Aslak, who was Bue's foster-brother, and
> forecastle commander, although he could wound right and left.'
> 
> - King Olaf Tryggvason's Saga

**Thrown Spear**: Throwing a spear does the same damage as wielding it one handed. It
does not travel as far as a javelin when thrown. However, a cast spear can still neutralise a
shield used to parry it, using the Pin Weapon Combat Manoeuvre. In this circumstance,
the pinned shield cannot be used until the spear has been removed (which takes one
round).

**Thrown Stone**: Picking up and hurling a palm sized stone inflicts only incidental
damage. Volleyed stones cast in this way can actually be a threat against unprotected
opponents.

## Clothing
Viking clothing is a simple, yet practical, combination of tunics and trews for men and
apron dresses for women, with socks and shoes of various types. In colder months or
during bad weather, several layers of tunics are often worn to keep warm. Additional
protection is provided by woollen gloves and leather over-mittens for the hands, extra
thick woollen socks, grass stuffed felt boots, hoods, coats and waterproofed cloaks.

The fabrics used for clothing are primarily woollen textiles, with a soft feel due to the
type of wool used and weaving techniques. Linens are often imported from regions like
England but due to expense are generally reserved for under-tunics or under-dresses.
Silk is extraordinarily expensive, imported from Byzantium where it costs more than its
own weight in gold. Fortunately silk is light and a little goes a long way.

Woollen or silk fabrics take dye easily and a broad range of muted colours are available.
Red from madder; blue from woad; yellow from weld or onion skins; purple from
lichens; and greens from over-dyeing yellow with blue. A very dark brownish-black can
be produced from walnut shells and iron.

The following garments assume a basic item of clothing with no decoration. Fancier
garb suitable to project wealth and importance multiplies the cost. Add all multipliers
together before calculating the final cost of the item.

| Enhancement | Description                                                                                                 | Cost Multiplier |

here to give a general idea about how much they cost if they need to be replaced,
accounted for in a theft law case, or part of liquidating a steading's assets to pay off a
weregild.

## Other Sundries
Games Masters are encouraged to avoid focussing on the prices of other incidental
articles since if an Adventurer owns, or works on a farmstead, such minor needs can
be satisfied by the farm itself. If you need a few weeks worth of food then you ask the
mistress of the house to withdraw some provisions from the storehouse. If you need a
new pair of shoes, then ask Uncle Arngrim who will knock up a pair overnight.

Landless Adventurers who wander the lands seeking adventure will probably find
their personal needs satisfied by whomever they are lodging with. Truly hospitable
hosts will give out spare changes of clothes and feed someone indefinitely. Need to
travel to the next fjord over? Then a horse will be loaned to you. Such is the way that
Viking society works.

Adventurers who swear fealty to a jarl or king become his huskarls. It is that lord's
responsibility to ensure that his men are well clothed, armed, armoured and given
plenty of food and drink. The Adventurer need not worry about small purchases since
he can probably requisition anything he legitimately needs from the lords steading.

A campaign should emphasise that treasure or wages really have very little direct
use. True wealth is in land ownership and famous gifts. Keeping tabs on money and
accumulating supplementary material possessions is a fruitless activity. If players insist
on micro managing their economy, a wise Games Master will either strip them of their
funds, forcing them into a few years of active exile, or reward them with some land of
their own so they no longer have to worry about it.

Failing that, simply make up a price!


## Viking Ships
Long sleek shapes, high dragon headed prows and single square rigged sails, Viking
longships are fearfully watched for from every coast, a portent of doom for many.
However, not all Viking vessels are warships. The majority are traders or transports
used for exploration, merchant voyages or colonisation.

The identifying features of a Norse vessel are a clinker built hull with overlapping strakes,
which has a shallow keel so it can be beached safely. The hull has a pointed prow and
stern, incorporating a side mounted rudder and a single mast from which a crossbeam
supports a single rectangular sail. This simple design is both relatively easy to construct
and fast in the water. Its mode of propulsion is flexible, taking advantage of the wind
where possible but can run out oars and travel by rowing when necessary. This enables it
to cross open seas, yet still be able to penetrate inland following rivers upstream.

This adaptability and swiftness is the reason the Vikings have ranged so far from their
Scandinavian homes, excelling as traders and pirates. To reflect their somewhat specialised
designs, the following ships have been split in two categories, warships and merchantmen.

Each ship detailed in this chapter shares the following Characteristics, whether the ship
in question is a longserpent or a simple skiff.

Length: The distance from bow to stern.

Beam: The widest part of a ship – usually in the middle. Ships equipped with oars will
have the beam of the ship increased when the oars are employed. The inclusion of oars
is considered to increase a ship's beam to half again its original rating.

Draft: The depth of water needed for the ship to manoeuvre effectively and avoid
running aground. This is the distance between the ship's keel and the waterline.

Freeboard: The minimum height between the ship's gunwale and the waterline.
Comparing two ships' freeboards can help give the vertical distance that an Adventurer
needs to achieve when jumping from one to the other.

Capacity: This indicates the cargo capacity of the ship in tons. This number reflects
the ship's cargo capacity in addition to the weight of the ship's rigging, crew, provisions
and so forth.

Speed: The speed at which the ship travels per Combat Action. A ship that relies solely
upon sails for propulsion is dependent on the wind for its speed.

Seaworthiness: The ability of the ship to stand up to the rigours of sailing. All ships
must undergo frequent maintenance in order to prevent their Seaworthiness rating
from deteriorating.

Hull: The hull acts as the ship's armour, just as a suit of chainmail does for a man.

Structure Points: Essentially, Structure Points are a ship's Hit Points. Damage to these
represents damage to the integrity of the ship itself and ships do not heal of their own
accord. A ship must be hauled onto a beach or into a ship house for structure points
to be repaired.

Ram: Viking ships do not mount rams per se, their design is not intended to take the
strain of a severe forward impact. Their curving arched prows however could probably
run over the gunwale of a smaller vessel if striking it amidships, crushing and possibly
swamping it. If a Viking ship does attempt to ram, assume it inflicts 1D6 damage per
four metres of movement it was travelling at. However, half of that damage should be
applied to the ramming ship too.

Skill: Every ship has its own peculiarities and each design presents different challenges.
This entry firstly denotes which skill is used when operating the ship (nearly always
either Boating or Shiphandling). Also, though any ship can be operated under ideal
conditions without the necessity of a Skill Test, when the ship and crew are called
upon for more extreme endeavours, this modifier is applied to the test. Note that this
modifier is in addition to any others that the Games Master feels are appropriate.


Warships
Collectively known as Drakkar, the hulls of Viking warships are long and narrow,
optimised for speed. They possess at least 20 pairs of oars and carry large crews of
warriors who, when necessary, take turns at the oars. The balance between speed and
cargo capacity indicates whether a ship is intended for coastal raiding or sea battles.
Most warships belonging to a jarl or king possess dragon figureheads but some ships
have different animal figureheads for theirs, such as storks or bulls.

Snekke
A small longship designed to be easily beached or portaged. Their shallow draft allows
them to range almost anywhere.

King Olaf's Levy for War
Soon after the king convoked a Thing in the town, and proclaimed to all the public, that in
summer would go abroad upon an expedition out of the country, and would raise both ships
and men from every district; and at the same time fixed how many ships would have from
the whole Throndhjem fjord. Then he sent his message-token south and north, both along
the sea-coast and up in the interior of the country, to let an army be gathered.

The king ordered the Long Serpent to be put into the water, along with all his other ships
both small and great. He himself steered the Long Serpent. When the crews were taken out
for the ships, they were so carefully selected that no man on board the Long Serpent was
older than sixty or younger than twenty years, and all were men distinguished for strength
and courage. Those who were Olaf 's bodyguard were in particular chosen men, both of the
natives and of foreigners, and the boldest and strongest.

- King Olaf Tryggvason's Saga



Merchantmen
Merchant ships, collectively known as Kaupskip, are the dedicated cargo carriers capable
of sailing over open seas in relative security. With broader hulls they gain stability in
exchange for speed.

Crew: 2–4 men
Speed: 22m at top speed (9 knots)
Ram: None
Skill: Boating +20%
Cost: 30 marks of silver


Byrding
A small trading ship that is capable of sailing long distances over open ocean. They
normally cross between Iceland and Norway transporting cargoes. A responsive vessel,
this ship is a perfect mid sized trading ship.

Cost: 80 marks of silver


Knarr
Broad but manoeuvrable, the knarr is a merchant ship able to traverse wide seas or
rivers with equal ease. It has a foredeck and stern deck where rowing is done but the
swell of the hull amidships is left open to ease loading and storing cargo.

Hull: 3
Structure Points: 40
Seaworthiness: 22
Length: 16m
Beam: 4.5m
Capacity: 22 tons

Cost: 40 marks of silver


Viking Naval Battles
In the early years of the Viking Age, raiders and pirates usually sail the seas in ones or
twos and any battles that occur are boarding actions rather than attempting to use the
ship as a weapon itself. Viking ships, despite being excellent sailing and rowing vessels,
are fragile constructions when it comes to ramming or being rammed.

As their mastery of shipbuilding grows, ever larger vessels are constructed capable of
carrying warriors at high speed across the sheltered Danish and Baltic seas. Since their
purpose is more of being rapid troop carriers than instruments of destruction, naval
tactics adopt a novel way of fighting battles. One side, or both, simply lashes their
ships together and forms a semi stable fortification to fight from. The largest ships are
generally held at the centre with smaller vessels tied to either side.

King Olaf ordered the war-horns to sound for all his ships to close up to each other. The
king's ship lay in the middle of the line, and on one side lay the Little Serpent, and on the
other the Crane; and as they made fast the stems together, the Long Serpent's stem and the
short Serpent's were made fast together; but when the king saw it he called out to his men,
and ordered them to lay the larger ship more in advance, so that its stern should not lie so
far behind in the fleet.

- King Olaf Tryggvason's Saga

The crews take up positions along the prows and sterns of the ships laying abreast
one another, allowing them to concentrate their numbers without worrying about
their flanks. From their positions they fire or throw missile weapons at their attackers,
including rocks and anvils, often using oars to prevent attacking ships from getting too
close or to knock off potential boarders.

Fire is rarely used in large sea battles, since not only is there a risk of it spreading to all
the ships involved, be they friend or foe, but also because ships themselves are valuable
prizes in addition to their cargo.

Once the battle is over, survivors are normally allowed to depart in small boats, leaving
their leaders and possessions behind.

Due to this rather simplified form of fighting, Games Masters do not need to worry
about complex rules for naval engagements. If a ship wishes to avoid being drawn into
a boarding action, then a simple Opposed Test of the two helmsmen's Shiphandling or
Boating skills, with a –20% penalty for the slower vessel, is sufficient to resolve whether
it managed to avoid the engagement.


                           Viking Religion
'It is customary also to solemnise in Uppsala, at nine-year intervals, a general feast of all the
provinces of Sweden. From attendance at this festival no one is exempted. Kings and people
all and singly send their gifts to the temple and, what is more distressing than any kind of
punishment, those who have already adopted Christianity redeem themselves through these
ceremonies.

The sacrifice is of this nature: of every living thing that is male, they offer nine heads, with
the blood of which it is customary to placate gods of this sort. The bodies they hang in the
sacred grove that adjoins the temple. Now this grove is so sacred in the eyes of the heathen
that each and every tree in it is believed divine because of the death or putrefaction of the
victims. Even dogs and horses hang there with men.

Furthermore, the incantations customarily chanted in the ritual of a sacrifice of this kind are
manifold and unseemly; therefore, it is better to keep silence about them'

- Adam of Bremen 11th C.

The beliefs and religion of the Vikings are a fertile breeding ground for conflict and
adventure. During the first half of the Viking Age most inhabitants of Scandinavia
faithfully worship the Æsir, the gods of Asgard, and take care to respect the spirits
of the land, the landvættir. Soon however, the spread of Christianity brings its pious
priests to the shores of the southern Viking kingdoms and the church began a long
struggle to gain a foothold in Scandinavia.

Due to the intolerant attitude of the priests towards the methods of the Old Faith, the
church was not welcomed by the pagan inhabitants. Circumventing the common folk
the priests threw in their lot with the slowly stratifying nobility, seeing an opportunity
for mutual benefit. Thus began a time of religious conflict, which caused some kings
to almost lose their rule and eventually helped contribute to the war for control over
Norway. Towards the end of the period religious persecution led to the murder and
torture of pagans, which in return caused those who feared the anger of the gods to
attack the priesthood.

Many people fled Scandinavia for less troubled lands where the church was more
adaptable to Viking superstitions. The priests eventually gave up trying to exterminate
pagan practices and most Vikings happily took up the mantle of Christianity whilst
simultaneously continuing to believe in Odin, Thor, Freyr and the rest of the Norse
pantheon, continuing their worship in private.

Even after the religious persecution and the grudging acceptance of Christianity, the
old ways of worship lived on. Up until 1078 the terrible sacrifices continued at Uppsala,
showing that the church failed to establish a complete stranglehold over pagan beliefs
until well beyond the end of the period.

Viking religion is, like their belief in supernatural creatures and magic, an eclectic and
contradictory mess of animism, polytheism and creeping Christianity. No matter when
you set a campaign, Vikings will offer sacrifices and pray to anything or anyone whom
they think will aid them in their troubles.


Spirits, Gods and God
Scandinavians are primarily polytheists. That is to say, they believe in all gods and grant
them equal respect, if not necessarily reverence. Thus throughout a year folk participate
in communal ceremonies to the deities of the Norse pantheon, leaving none out for
fear of offending them. Everyone knows about the gods, as the skalds frequently sing
of their tales and deeds. A Viking is free to give worship to any of the Æsir he desires,
at any time. There are no jealous and exclusive relationships.

Likewise, Vikings are also animists. They understand the existence of spirits and the need
to show them respect else face petty but vindictive tricks when an angered landvættir
takes revenge for some slight. Spirits are everywhere. They live on the farmsteads in
the form of helpful tomte. They reside in forests as seductive skogsfru. Dangerous sjora
such as nykr live in waterfalls and deep pools ready to drown foolish folk. Dark, wild
places are to be avoided so that these less civilised landvættir will not be disturbed. The
inhabitants of a stead often perform small rituals to placate the spirits, offering small
gifts and places at their dining table to keep them happy.

Vikings who have been converted to Christianity, whether willingly or forced,
completely ignore the Second Commandment, continuing to propitiate the landvættir
and Æsir. Pragmatic and fatalistic as they are, they see no sin involved, merely necessity.
Even the stave-churches built by the Vikings combine mythological figures and pagan
symbols into the structure of an erstwhile house of god.

A fanatical believer in Christianity who puts aside the religion of his fathers will
soon find himself ostracised from society – people believing that the madman will be
struck down by some disaster and not willing to be caught in the wash of bad luck.
Whether or not the subsequent misfortune is orchestrated by human hands or a divine,
supernatural agency is for the Games Master to know and the player to guess at.

Of course most Scandinavians dislike the intrusion of Christianity into their lands
and being told what they can and cannot worship. After all, no king can order them
about in such a way, so why should a priest be able to? This cultural insensitivity leads
to many violent conflicts and only ceases once hereditary kingships eventually start to
replace the democratic freedoms of the people with feudalistic controls.

The Old Ways
A fundamental aspect of Scandinavian culture is how and why people worship the
gods and spirits. Understanding this is vitally important because of the effect it has on
historical and fantasy Viking campaigns.

One difficult concept to comprehend is this. Vikings do not generally pray to the gods
and spirits as supplicants to request that a miracle occur; rather they propitiate them in
advance to ward off possible tribulation and again afterward in thanks for withholding
calamity. Or put in another way, they ask for the preservation of the normal status quo
and are grateful for it.

When misfortune does arrive, as it inevitably does, then folk believe that they have
offended a god or spirit by not paying it the proper attention; for example saying an
inopportune thing, forgetting to thank them or not being generous enough at the last
sacrifice to repay their beneficence.

Another unusual aspect of Scandinavian pagan religion is that there are no professional
priests. Although Godi have a responsibility to perform the sanctification sacrifice for
the thing, they are chieftains and law speakers, not religious guides. The head of the
family is responsible for the sacrifices to gods and spirits on a farmstead and if he is
ill or away from home, the next most senior family member will perform the rights
instead. Aboard ship it is the captain who holds the duties to propitiate the sea and any
man can make his own private sacrifice in thanks for surviving a voyage intact.

Sacrifices or blot as they are known, are held to gods and spirits throughout the year.
Normally a sacrifice involves the killing of an animal at an altar of piled stones called
a horgr, a sacred grove called a lund or a grave mound called a haugr. The blood of
the sacrifice is sprinkled over the people attending the ceremony, before pouring the
remainder onto the land, altar or barrow. The meat of the animal is then cooked, part
offered to the beings propitiated and the rest consumed by the attendees.

Up until the advent of Christianity, there were few formal temples. The 'great' temple
at Uppsala held shrines to Odin, Thor and Freyr but was a wooden building of very
modest size, although as a sign of its status it was hung with a golden chain that
encircled the building hanging from its eves.

Instead most people held their sacrifices outdoors, since in many cases it was the natural
environment that was considered holy and closer to the gods; or in a small shrine called a hov,
which could be an outbuilding on a farm or someone's longhouse sanctified for the occasion.

The major communal sacrifices of the year were at:

*	 Yuletide when darkness was at its deepest and everyone offered food and drink to
the gods to ensure the return of spring.
*	 Spring was when Odin received sacrifices to avert disaster in forthcoming wars.
*	 Autumn after the harvest had been gathered, to thank the gods especially Freyr,
for protecting the crops.


A Pagan Sacrifice
'It was an old custom, that when there was to be sacrifice all the freeholders should come to
the spot where the temple stood and bring with them all that they required while the festival
of the sacrifice lasted. To this festival all the men brought ale with them; and all kinds of
cattle, as well as horses, were slaughtered, and all the blood that came from them was called
'hlaut', and the vessels in which it was collected were called hlaut-vessels. Hlaut-staves were
made, like sprinkling brushes, with which the whole of the altars and the temple walls, both
outside and inside, were sprinkled over, and also the people were sprinkled with the blood;
but the flesh was boiled into savoury meat for those present. The fire was in the middle of
the floor of the temple, and over it hung the kettles, and the full goblets were handed across
the fire; and he who made the feast, and was a chief, blessed the full goblets, and all the
meat of the sacrifice. And first Odin's goblet was emptied for victory and power to his king;
thereafter, Niord's and Freyja's goblets for peace and a good season.'

- Haakon the Good's Saga




Some very important blot are held every nine years, nine being a sacred number, which
grant the ceremonies extra significance. The quote at the beginning of this chapter
tells of a sacrifice held by the kings of Sweden to ensure that the land remains free
from famine and plague. When the sacrifices failed as they sometimes did, the kings
themselves were occasionally offered as sacrifices, such as the killing of king Domalde –
who sacrificed oxen on the first year, men on the second and eventually was sacrificed
himself on the third.

Of course people hold private sacrifices in their own steads, seeking the continuation
of fertility or protection from fires. Ceremonies are even held aboard ship or in foreign
lands. In Gautrek's Saga, when the fleet of King Vikar is blown off course and held
ashore by contrary winds, the king decides a human sacrifice must be provided to
Odin break the cursed weather. So the sailors draw lots and it is the King himself who
is selected by the gods to be the sacrifice, hanged and impaled on a spear.

Another type of blood sacrifice is made at the start of each thing; blessing the gathering
place, so as to ward off misfortune and maintain peace. This is the duty of the local
Godi and requires formalised rituals such as wearing an arm ring, upon which oaths
are sworn.

Other ritual sacrifices fill Scandinavian life. After fighting in a holmganga (duel) the
victor usually makes a sacrifice of a bull, in thanks for his victory (not before to ask for
it); and in Ibn Fadlan's account he speaks of Rus merchants who, in gratitude for selling
their cargoes, make a follow-up sacrifice of sheep or cattle to one of the gods saying
'Truly, my Lord is content with me and has consumed the present I brought him'.


Rewards of Worship
Unlike the deities of other mythologies, the Norse gods do not appear to be particularly
willing to intercede in the affairs of men. In the sagas the few times the gods respond
to a mortal supplicant, they appear in person and use their own tricks and guile to try
to solve a problem, in some cases failing completely.

The Æsir are not all powerful, all knowing forces of nature but rather appear to be great
heroes capable of some amazing but personal feats. In fact the gods are often powerless
to intercede for a mortal, simply because the fate of all men is predetermined by the
Norns, to whom even the Æsir must bend knee.

A warrior may pray for victory on the battle field but whether or not he survives
has little to do with Odin. The All-Father has no power to change the wyrd of his
supplicant. If he meddles in the battle, driving fear into his worshipper's foes, then it
is because of Odin's own hidden machinations. He will do nothing to directly help his
faithful but will certainly punish those who fail to show him the correct respect.

Thus the faith of a Viking worshiper is a grim one. You propitiate because you must,
since failing to do so brings misfortune. Yet even the most generous of sacrifices will
not result in observable aid. Men must achieve their own miracles by wit and skill, not
rely on the Æsir to nursemaid them.

This dour attitude combined with their informal polytheistic habits means that there
are no cults dedicated to the Norse gods, at least none which offer any sort of reward
for spiritual devotion.


Propitiating Gods and Spirits
Games Masters who wish to make more use of Viking religion and superstition should
allow their players to propitiate the gods or spirits when necessary. An Adventurer who
owns a steading, for instance, can attempt a propitiation to ensure the tomte of the
farm remains happy, or those about to travel by ship may try to propitiate the gods to
prevent a storm blowing up.

No special skill is required to interact with the gods or spirits, since these are ceremonies
that everyone observes and performs from childhood. All that is needed is a suitable
animal offering, the expenditure of a single Hero Point and a test against Culture
(Viking) – which the Games Master should roll and keep the results hidden.

*	 A critical success indicates that the god or spirit is pleased by the offering and ensures
good fortune smiles upon the venture and that it goes perfectly and profitably.
*	 A normal success determines that nothing bad occurs during the venture.
*	 A failure means that the god or spirit is piqued at something said or the meanness
of the sacrifice and a piece of misfortune strikes during the venture, causing it to
fail if not overcome.
*	 A fumble brings down the full displeasure of the entities, resulting in the venture
failing disastrously.


What no Churches or Guilds!?!
Some Games Masters will be disappointed at the lack of Divine Magic churches or
guilds for each of the Norse gods. Although the concept of Priests of Thor casting
lightning bolts sounds pretty cool, not even the most fantastic of the eddas and sagas
reflect this type of thing in their entertaining tales. What magic does exist in the stories
is always a personal ability known by the hero or his enemy. A skilled seidr practitioner
or shaman is more than capable of performing supernatural miracles.

Put simply, in Legend, the Vikings lack a formal priest class and their gods are incapable
of granting flashy miracles.

However, not everyone wants to play in a historically based game world. Thus for
campaigns where the players want to join churches and wield Divine Magic, the author
suggests purchasing other Legend sourcebooks and adapting the applicable gods of the
pantheons found in them into their Viking equivalents. For example, a fantasy church
of Thor would probably match a fantasy Storm God and Tyr is fit for a 'Glorious
Battle' God's church.



For example, Arngrim the Tall must face a terrifying berserk in a holmganga and decides
to propitiate Tyr, asking to be warded from serious injury. Since he is not directly requesting
victory the Games Master decides that the god will listen to the plea. Burning a Hero
Point Arngrim sacrifices a horse and the Games Master tests Arngrim's Culture (Own)
skill, rolling a success. The following day, during the duel Arngrim finds himself badly
outmatched, already suffering several minor wounds. At a critical moment however, just
as his arm is about to be severed, the berserk's sword splinters on Arngrim's silver arm ring,
saving the pious Swede from being maimed. Although the berserk is briefly flummoxed, he
wrestles Arngrim to the ground and wins the fight anyway but impressed by this good fortune
the berserk decides Arngrim is a man of bravery and luck, dropping the law case entirely.
Afterwards Arngrim sacrifices a bull to thank the god properly for his aid.


Viking Cosmology
The myths of the Vikings are rich with imagery. The formation of the world, giants
and gods is a popular tale, as were the epics of their subsequent battles and adventures.


The Beginning
In the beginning there was no world, only Ginnungagap, the yawning void. Within
the void coalesced the realms of Muspelheimr, the lands of heat and ashes to the south,
within which lived Surtr the lord of fires; and Nifelheimr, the land of ice and frozen
rock to the north. Down in the depths of the void lay Hvergelmir, the spring of life.
From the well flowed 12 great rivers and as they flowed into the void froze, forming a
gargantuan mountain of ice.

When the mountain rose to the heights of Muspelheimr and Nifelheimr, the ashes
from the fires melted the ice, creating clouds of steam that blew north causing never
ending drizzle and cold rain. From these mists, Ymir the father of the frost giants
emerged, born out of the melting ice. With him was formed Audumla, a mighty cow
whose milk nourished Ymir.

The shards of ice that splintered off Ymir became rime giants, the first was a six
headed giant called Thrudgelmir, the second Bergelmir from which all the Jotnar were
descended. To feed herself, the cow licked at the life giving salt in the ice, which arose
from Hvergelmir. As she licked her tongue exposed a new being, on the first day his
hair, on the second his head and on the third his entire body. This was Buri, the first of
the Æsir, tall of stature, strong of limb and fair of face.

Buri had a son named Borr, who married a giantess named Bestla. From this union
three great Æsir were sired, Odin, Vili and Ve. The sons and father banded together and
fought a mighty battle against Ymir and his kin, slaying the colossal giant. From Ymir's
wounds gushed torrents of icy water, which drowned all of the giants save Bergelmir,
who built a boat with a roof and rowed to freedom with his family.


The Forming of Midgardr
Odin and his brothers took Ymir's corpse that filled the void of Ginnungagap and tore
it into pieces with which they formed the world. His blood became the oceans, his
flesh the land, his broken bones the mountains, his teeth the cliffs and boulders. The
brothers took the ice-blue skull and used it to create the dome of the sky, supported at
cardinal points by four dwarfs birthed for the purpose. Finally his brains became the
clouds.

After the creation of the Midgardr, or middle earth, the Æsir sat in a ring and
contemplated. From within the circle sprouted Yggdrasil, the world tree. Its branches
rose up into the heavens to help support the sky. Its roots delved deep into the well of
Hvergelmir.

The Æsir then gathered sparks flying up out of Muspelheimr and scattered them to
form stars. They then drew molten gold from the lava of Surtr's realm and fashioned a
beautiful sun-chariot that glowed with blinding light and heat. To it was hitched the
horses Allsvinn and Arvak (Very-fast and Early-walker) with the maiden Sol to drive it.
Before it went the moon-chariot pulled by Alsvid (Very-strong) driven by a boy named
Mani.

The giants took offense at the workings of the Æsir and set two monstrous wolves,
the sons of a giantess, to pursue the chariots; Skoll chases the sun and Hati the moon.
When they occasionally catch their prey, their light is sometimes blotted out, so the
inhabitants of Midgardr must make noise to scare off the wolves before they can
consume their victims.

The Creation of Time
Norvi, a descendant of the giants that survived the great flood, gave birth to a daughter
called Nott (night). In turn Nott had three children from three fathers; Aud, Jord
(earth) and Dag (day). The Æsir gave Nott a chariot of her own to circle Midgardr,
drawn by the horse Hrimfaxi (Frost-mane). Yet when they saw the radiant beauty of
Dag, her son, they granted him a chariot too, drawn by Skinfaxi (Shining-mane).

As more things appeared in the world, more guardians were appointed to oversee them.
The seasons were given to Winter, the grandson of the god Vasud the frigid wind, and
Summer, the son of the god Svasud. Winter inherited a bitter temperament, always
feuding with Summer, blowing terrible storms when they shifted their control to and fro.


Birth of the Alfar, Dvergar and Men
Whilst creating the earth and heavens, Odin and his brothers discovered maggots
crawling in the dead flesh of Ymir. They took these creatures and from them formed
beings. Some became the Alfar, or elves, and were granted their own realm of Alfheimr
to rule over. Others became the Dvergar, the dwarfs, and lived in the dreary realm of
Svartalfaheimr.

The Alfar were creatures of light and purity, who excelled in the skills of dancing,
singing and joyful entertainments. The Dvergar were dark and grim, masters of
craftsmanship and art, loving only the things they made.

A third race was created by the brothers. Askr, the first man, was formed from an Ash
tree, Embla, the first woman, from an Elm. Odin granted the new people souls, Vili
gave them thought and Ve gave them senses. The couple produced many children
who populated Midgardr but their purity and innocence were corrupted by the jotnar,
who took upon themselves human form and bred with mankind to create many evil
creatures.


Asgardr and Yggdrasil
After their hard work the Æsir desired a home of their own. High in the branches of
Yggdrasil, far above Midgardr, Odin laboured long and hard to shape Asaheimr, better
known as Asgardr. This land was warm and beautiful filled with the halls of the other
Æsir, children sired on female giants. Around Asgardr Odin placed the magical river
Thund, which sweeps all those who try to cross down into Helheim, the land of death.
To connect this realm with Midgardr was forged Bifrost, a rainbow bridge guarded
against the approach of giants, that glowed in the light of the watch fire at its foot.

Three final realms came into being, each hosting a great tribe. Vanaheimr was the home
of the Vanir and Jotunheimr the land of giants. The last and dourest was Niflehel, or
Helheim, where the souls of those who died of age or misfortune went after death.
This land was given over to Hel, a daughter of Loki who took up the mantle of their
guardianship, ruling from her hall Eljudnir (Damp with sleet). Within the realm was


Halls of the Gods
The Æsir of Asgardr have their own halls, built to their wants and needs. For campaigns
where Adventurers may receive divine visions, or actually journey to Asgardr, the
following names and descriptions are provided:

*	 Bilskirnir (Lightning-crack) – Thor's hall of 540 rooms located in Thrudheim
(Field of the strong).
*	 Breidablik (Broad-shining) – Baldr's magnificent hall where nothing unclean
exists.
*	 Fensalir (Water-falls) – Frigg's hall.
*	 Gladsheim (Bright-home) – The meeting hall of the Æsir on the plains of Idavoll.
*	 Glitnir (Splendour) – The silver and gold hall of Forseti, son of Baldr.
*	 Himinbjorg (Mountain in the clouds) – Heimdallr's hall, located next to the
Bifrost bridge.
*	 Noatun (Ship-yard) – Niord's hall.
*	 Sessrumnir (Seat-room) – Freyja's hall in Folkvangr (Folk-field) where those
warriors who do are not chosen to join Odin's Einherjar go.
*	 Sokvabekk (Deep-stream) – The crystal hall of Saga, daughter of Odin.
*	 Valaskjalf (Seat of the Slain) – Odin's silver roofed hall in which his high throne
Hlidskjalf stands.
*	 Valhalla (Hall of the Slain) – The hall where Odin's Einherjar, the chosen of those
who fall in battle, are hosted. It is located at the edge of Vigrid, the plane where
the final battle will occur.
*	 Vidi (Wooden) – Vidar's hall.
*	 Vingolf (Friends-hall) – The hall of the goddesses which lies upon Idavoll, the
central plain of Asgard.
*	 Ydalir (Yew-dale) – Ullr's hall.



Nastrond, a hall where no light reached, covered with serpent skins and dripping
with venom, where the corpses of evil doers were sucked upon by a great wyrm. The
entrance to Niflehel was guarded by the hound Garm who lay chained at the mouth of
Gnipahellir (Mountaintop-cave).

Mighty Yggdrasil connected all the nine realms together, its three roots tapping
the spring of life Hvergelmir, the well of fate Urdarbrunnr and the well of wisdom
Mimisbrunnr. These enchanted waters gave the tree its strength and power.

Upon the tree live many creatures. The dragon Nidhoggr (Bites-in-anger) gnaws at its
roots, four stags crop its branches, a wise eagle sits in its crown looking over the cosmos
and a squirrel Rataosk (Teeth-that-find) darts up and down the trunk carrying insults
between the eagle and the wyrm.


The Time of Great Deeds
After the nine realms formed, the Æsir began their great deeds. Odin sought knowledge
exchanging an eye for a drink from Mimir's well and sacrificed himself to Yggdrasil
hanging for nine days and nights to find the secret of the Runes. He then stole the
mead of poetry from the giant Suttung, further enhancing his wisdom.

The Æsir met with the Vanir and began a great war but the Vanir proved their worth
and honour, so the two tribes sought peace and exchanged hostages, hence Freyr came
to Asgardr. Soon after came Loki and for a while worked with the Æsir against the
giants but his heart was ever shadowed by his trickery and eventually jealousy was his
and the Æsir's undoing.

Loki's trickery brought boons to the Æsir in the form of mighty weapons and magical
treasures forged by the dwarfs. Greatest of all however was Thor's hammer Mjollnir,
whose power could slay giant's with a single blow. He also brought many evils, two
of them his own children, the huge ravening wolf Fenrir and the Midgardr serpent
Jormungandr, fated to kill Odin and Thor at the end of the world.



The Nine Worlds
Much confusion abounds concerning the relationship of the nine worlds and how
they connect with one another. Although they are variously described as lands, realms
and worlds in the eddas, the tales often contradict one another. In some stories the
lands appear to be physically divided by rivers or mountain ranges whereas other tales
indicate more magical separations, such as the rainbow bridge connecting Asgardr with
Midgardr.

No actual definition is provided here, save that Yggdrasil connects them all. For a
fantasy Viking campaign it is recommended that Adventurers undertake spirit quests
or utilise magical portals to reach the other realms, an elf-door in a hillside connecting
to Alfheimr for example. For mythic campaigns it is probably better to have most of the
realms physically connected so that heroes can surmount the barriers by wit and skill.

For easier reference the nine realms of Norse cosmology are:
*	 Nifelheimr – The land of ice and cold.
*	 Muspelheimr – The land of smoke and fire.
*	 Midgardr – Middle Earth where mankind resides.
*	 Alfheimr – The land of the elves.
*	 Svartalfaheimr – The land of the dwarfs.
*	 Asgardr – The home of the warlike Æsir, reached only by the Bifrost Bridge.
*	 Vanaheimr – The home of the Vanir, gods of fertility.
*	 Jotunheimr – The land of the giants.
*	 Niflehel – The land of the dead.


The giants feuded long and hard against the Æsir, many battles and quests were
pursued between the rivals. Amongst them were the theft of Mjollnir, the challengers
and cheating of Utgardaloki, the horse race between Odin and Hrungnir.

But doom foreshadowed the end of the Æsir. Driven by evil thoughts Baldr was killed
by Loki, who thereafter prevented his return from the halls of Hel. This helped sunder
the bonds between the Æsir and Loki who was eventually punished by being bound by
the entrails of his son Narfi whilst serpent venom dripped into his eyes. When the earth
shakes it is the painful writhing of Loki.

This final deed however, promulgates the eventual end of the gods. Odin retreats to
atop his high throne, grimly watching the world for signs of the long foretold fimbulvetr
(Mighty-winter) heralding the end of the world.


Ragnarok
For the Vikings the cataclysmic battle of Ragnarok, twilight of the gods, has yet to
happen. Although Odin knew that a great war would come, not even he could foretell
the future. The Norns would not tell him what he desired, so in disguise he visited the
wisest of all Volva who gave him this prophesy.

Brothers will fight and kill each other,
sisters' children will defile kinship.
It is harsh in the world, whoredom rife –
an axe age, a sword age, shields are riven
a wind age, a wolf age – before the world goes headlong.
No man will have mercy on another

After an eternity of chasing, the wolves Skoll and Hati will catch the chariots of Sol
and Mani, devouring them. In the darkness that follows comes three years of terrible
winter where many die of suffering and starvation. The bonds holding Loki, Fenrir and
Garm, break allowing them to escape. Loki travels to frost giants and his bitter words
raises a mighty horde.

Alerted by his far seeing eyes, Heimdallr will sound the warning blast on his magical
horn, alerting the Æsir who muster with the heroes of the Einherjar to fight the final
battle. This winding stirs the seas arousing Jormungand the Midgard Serpent to rise
from the ocean depths. On the raging waves Naglfari, the ship formed from the nails
of dead men, tears free of its moorings and captained by the giant Hrym carries the
frost giants to war. Surtr leads an army of fire giants over Bifrost, which shatters under
the army's weight.

In the titanic struggle Odin is slain by Fenrir, who in turn is killed by Odin's son
Vidar who tears apart the jaws of the dire wolf. Tyr battles Garm the hound of Hel but
hindered by his single hand both slay one another. Freyr, lacking his magical sword is
slaughtered by Surtr. Heimdallr and Loki in mutual hatred kill each other. Thor in a


The Days of the Week
The Viking names of the weekdays are based upon names of the Norse gods.

English Name                Norse Name                   Origin
Monday                      Manadagr                     Moon's Day
Tuesday                     Tysdagr                      Tyr's Day
Wednesday                   Ódinsdagr                    Odin's Day
Thursday                    Thorsdagr                    Thor's Day
Friday                      Frjadagr                     Freyr's Day
Saturday                    Laugardagr                   Washing Day
Sunday                      Sunnudagr                    Sun's Day




valiant struggle defeats Jormungand but nine steps later is overcome by the poison. The
thrashing of the serpent causes a cataclysmic flood whilst Surtr will burn Yggdrasil and
all the nine realms.

The only survivors of the battle will be the sons of Odin, Vidar and Vali; the sons
of Thor, Modi and Magni; and the brothers Baldr and Hoder will return from the
realm of Hel. Of mankind only Lif and Lifthrasir survive the flames to repopulate a
rejuvenated Midgardr free of evil and misfortune.


The Gods
The gods of the Vikings are both the Æsir and Vanir who rule in Asgard and the
giants who control the elemental powers. They have many tales associated with them,
of which many still survive to the modern day. A Games Master who is considering
running a Mythic Viking campaign should read the wonderful tales of the Norse gods
to understand their personalities, motivations and use of trickery to survive against the
ever present threat of the giants.

A quick overview of each god follows.


Aegir (The Ale Brewer)
The god of the sea. He is a giant, son of Mistblindi, brother of Logi and married to
Ran. Aegir was a neutral deity with whom the Æsir remained cordial.


Baldr (The Bright One)
The son of Odin and Frigg, fated to be accidentally killed by his brother Hodr. Balder
is known as a gentle and wise god, for which he is fated to return after Ragnarok. He is
also known as Balder or Baldur.


Bor (The Son)
The son of Buri and married to the giantess Bestla, the 'Little Sauna Woman', with
whom he fathered Odin, Vili and Ve.


Bragi (Best, Highest)
The god of poetry and eloquence, patron of skalds. He is a son of Odin and Gunnlod,
and husband to Idun. Bragi greets the new arrivals at Valhalla with songs of their heroic
deeds.


Buri (Good Looking)
The ancestor of the gods. Freed from the primordial ice by the cow Audmula licking
him free. Buri was the only god to die of old age since he lived before the Aplles of
Idun were grown.


Day
The son of Nott and Delling. He drives a chariot around Midgardr drawn by his horse
Skinfaxi.


Delling (Dawn)
The guard at the hall Breidablik and lover of Nott. He is the father of his son Day.


Eir (Mercy)
Goddess of healing and medicine, a handmaiden to Frigga. She is the daughter of
Njord and sister to Freya.


Fjorgynn
The god of weather and father of Frigga.


Forseti (The Presiding One)
The god of peace and justice, who lives in the hall Glitner. He is the son of Balder and
Nanna.


Freyja (The Lady)
The goddess of seidr magic. She is one of the Vanir, daughter of Njord and sister
of Freyr. She owns the necklace Brisingamen for which she slept with its four dwarf
creators. She was once married to Od who disappeared and weeps tears for his loss.


Freyr (The Lord)
The god of fertility and protector of sailors. He is also one of the Vanir, who was
exchanged as a hostage as part of the peace settlement between the Æsir and Vanir.
Son of Njord and brother of Freyja, he owns many enchanted objects, the boar
Gullinbursti, the ship, Skidbladnir and once owned a magic sword that fought by itself
but exchanged it to marry the giantess Gerd. He rules over Alfheim and fathered the
royal line of the Yngling family.


Frigg (The Loving)
The goddess of prophetic magic and childbirth, she can see the fate of all but chooses
not to prophesise. Daughter of Fjorgynn she is the wife of Odin and mother of six sons
and one daughter, including Baldr and Hodr.


Fulla (The Filler)
The maiden sister of Frigga she bears a small chest containing the powers of life and
death.


Gefjun (The Gift Giver)
The goddess of fertility, who married a giant and had four sons. When commanded by
Odin to seek land from Gylfi the king of Sweden, the king amusedly promised her as
much land as she could plough in a day. Changing her sons into oxen she ploughed a
vast section of land, which she carried down to the bottom of the sea. She then married
Skjold a son of Odin, birthed the royal line of the Skioldungs and became the guardian
of all those who died unwedded, granting them a life of eternal happiness.


Gullveig (Gold Thirst)
A Vanir goddess who is the patroness of evil women. She came to live with the Æsir as a
handmaiden of Freyja but her delight in practicing evil seidr caused the gods to cast her
onto a fire three times to be burned. She survived each attempt so the Æsir magically
bound her to the Ironwood in Jotunheimr. There she slept with Loki and bore him
three monstrous offspring, Hel, Fenrir and Jormungand. The treatment of Gullveig
caused the initial war between the Æsir and Vanir.


Heimdallr (Heaven's Mount)
The watchman of the gods. Heimdallr was the son of nine mothers (the sea daughters of
Aegir) and a charm cast by Odin. At birth he was set within a small boat which washed
up in Midgardr. There he taught crafts and social organisation to mankind, sleeping
with three women who in turn gave birth to the thralls, farmers and noblemen. His
mortal form dying of old age, he was sent back to Vanaheimr in the boat in which he
arrived. There he was reborn to eternal youth and travelled to Odin, who asked him
to guard the Bifrost Bridge. Heimdallr has teeth of gold, barely sleeps and can see and
hear for hundreds of miles. He blows the magical horn Gjallar when visitors come to
Asgardr.


Hel (Death)
The goddess of death and daughter of Loki, Hel rules over Niflhel where the dead who
do not journey to Asgardr come. By Odin's will she commands the dead of all nine
worlds in exchange for her oath that those sent to her are granted the hospitality of her
hall, which has huge gates and a very high wall. Her appearance is half black (the colour
of long dead flesh) and half normal. Whilst her realm is cold it is not a terrible place
but a hall of restful peace for those who die of old age or misfortune. She punishes evil
doers by sending them to Nastrond.


Hermod (Fast)
The god of swift travelling, messengers and bravery. Hermod is a son of Odin and
Frigga. He rescues Freyja from the giants in Jotunheimr. He alone volunteers to take
the terrifying journey down to Hel to ask for the return of his brother Balder. It is
also Hermod who acts as a secret liaison between Freyr and Gerd to negotiate their
wedding.


Hoder (War)
The god of war and a son of Odin and Frigga. Driven by an evil potion, which filled
his heart with love for Nanna, Baldr's bethrothed, he joined a war band of giants, in
revolt against Asgardr. Blinded in the battle, they were defeated and the repentant
Hoder returned to Asgardr with his brother Baldr. Tricked by Loki to fire an arrow
of mistletoe at Baldr, he unwittingly killed his brother. None of the Æsir would harm
Hoder in proper retaliation so Vali was born to perform the deed.


Honir
A warrior god respected for his aggressiveness and bravery. He was sent to the Vanir
along with Mimir to seal the truce between them and the Æsir but when he refused
to speak with the leader of the Vanir they beheaded Mimir and sent the head back to
Odin in displeasure.


Idun (She Who Renews)
The goddess of eternal life, she is the guardian of the golden apples of youth and wife
of Bragi. Each year she grants one of her apples to each of the gods.


Jord (Earth)
The daughter of Nott and Annar. She is the goddess of the earth and the mother of
Thor.


Lofn (Love)
The goddess of passion and illicit love affairs, she removes the barriers between lovers.


Loki (Fire)
Originally the god of fire, his sly nature changed him to become a trickster god, capable
of great cunning but flawed with a sadistic and cowardly nature. He is the son of
giants Farbauti (Cruel Smiter) and Laufrey. He married three times producing many
children. Firstly with Glut (Glow) who bore him two daughters, Eisa (Embers) and
Einmyria (Ashes). His second dalliance with the giantess Angr-boda (Anguish-Boding)
the shape-shifted Gullveig bore him the three monsters Hel, jormungand and Fenrir.

His third was with Sigyn who truly loved him. With her was birthed Vali and Narfi.
Loki himself bore (as a mare) Sleipnir, the eight legged horse, after a mating with
a giant stallion called Svadilfari. Loki is a famous shape-shifter, able to turn into a
salmon, a fly, a horse and many other creatures. Responsible for the death of Balder,
his is bound by the entrails of his son Narfi until Ragnarok whilst a serpent placed by
Skadi drips venom in his eyes.

Magni (The Powerful)
The god of strength, Magni is a son of Thor and the giantess Jarnsaxa. He will slay
the great wyrm Nidhogg at Ragnarok. With his brother Modi he will inherit Thor's
hammer Mjollnir.


Mimir (The Murmuring)
A giant who was the keeper of Mimisbrunnr the Well of Wisdom. He granted his
nephew Odin the chance to drink from the well in exchange for an eye. Mimir was
the wisest of all folk, knowing everything. He was sent to the Vanir to seal the truce
between them and the Æsir but was beheaded by the angered deities. His head was sent
back to Odin who revived it using a magical galdr. The head now remains guarding the
well where it sometimes speaks with the All-Father.


Modgud
The skeletal maiden who guards the Gjallarbridge over the river Gjoll in Jotenheim,
which leads to Niflhel. All those who wish to cross must first give blood and tell her
their name and family.


Modi (The Brave)
God of courage and son of Thor and the giantess Jarnsaxa. He is fated to survive
Ragnarok with his brother of Magni.


Mani (Moon)
The god of the moon, Mani is the son of Mundilfari. He steers the chariot of the moon
on its course, keeping ahead of the wolf Hati.


Nanna
The Æsir wife of Baldr and mother of Forseti, who dies of a broken heart after her
husband dies and is burned with him on his funeral boat.


Njord (Stiller of Storms)
The Vanir god of seafaring, he commands the wind and waves. The son of Nott and
father of Freyja and Freyr. He briefly married Skadi but broke up when neither liked
the other's home.


Norns, the
The three norns are Urd 'that which became', Verandi 'that which is happening' and
Skuld 'that which must be'. They respectively represented the past, present and future.
They are the guardians of Urdarbrunnr, the Well of Fate and they decide the wyrd of
all men and gods.

Ever green it stands over Urth's well.
From there come three maidens, deep in lore,
from the water that stands under the tree.
One is called Urth, the other Verthandi,
the third Skuld. Scores they carved,
laws they laid, lives they chose.
They worked Orlög for the sons of men.



Nott (Night )
The daughter of Narvi and mother of Day, Nott is the goddess of night. She rides
around Midgardr on her chariot drawn by Hrimfaxi, followed by her son.


Odin (Spirit)
The god of runes, shamanistic magic, battle and death. Odin is the chief of all
the Æsir. He has many names and many disguises, which he uses when travelling
the nine realms. His most common kennings are the 'all-father', the 'terrible one',
'one-eyed' and 'father of battle'. Odin helped form the cosmos and was the first to
discover the runes, after sacrificing himself on the world tree, hanging upside-down
for nine days and nights, without food or drink, with his spear impaled into him.
He is the bringer of terror on the battle field, casting his 'battle-fetter' on foes. He
drank from Mimir's Well in exchange for an eye. He stole the Mead of Poetry and
quaffed deeply of its power. He owns two ravens, Hugin (Thought) and Munin
(Memory), which fly across the worlds bringing him news of what occurs. He
also has two wolves Geri (Greedy) and Freki (Ravenous), which accompany him
everywhere and eat the meat from his plate as he only drinks wine. The magical
spear Gungnir is his.

Odin has had many wives and many sons. With Jord he had Thor, with Frigga he had
Hermod, Hoder and Baldr, with Rinda he gained Vali, with Grid was born Vidar, with
the giantess Gunnlod (with whom he slept to gain the Mead of Poetry) came Bragi and
with the nine daughters of Ran was produced Heimdallr. As if this was not enough he
often meets with Saga in the crystal hall of Sokvabek and sometimes sleeps with Skadi
his mistress of the Wild Hunt.


Ran (The Ravager)
The Vanir goddess of sea and death. She is the wife of Aegir and mother to nine
daughters. It is her responsibility to collect drowned people in her net but being of
malicious nature she sometimes uses it to drag still living men down under the waves.


Rind (Rime)
The goddess of the cold and frozen earth. Rind is a giantess and lover of Odin, with
whom she bore Vali.


Saga (Seeress)
Goddess of recall and memory. An attendant of Frigga she lives in her hall beside
the stream of time, from which she quaffs deeply, alongside her consort and drinking
companion of Odin.


Sif
The goddess of summer and grain. She is the second wife of Thor with whom she bore
Magni and Modi. Sif and can shape-shift into the form of a swan. She once had her
golden hair cut off by Loki but the dwarfs forged her new hair from pure gold, which
magically bound itself to her scalp.


Sigyn (The Faithful)
The goddess of monogamy, Sigyn is the faithful Æsir wife of Loki and mother of Vali
and Narfi. After her husband was bound and punished she remained with him, standing
with a bowl to capture the serpent venom, which drips into his eyes. Occasionally she
must empty the bowl, which is when Loki writhes in pain sending earthquakes through
Midgardr.


Sjofn (Affection)
The Æsir goddess of love and passion, she prevents fights between married couples.


Skadi (Harm)
The bringer of snow and goddess of wintertime destruction. The daughter of the Giant
Thjatsi she sought revenge for her father's death by the gods. Falling in love with Baldr
she accepts a settlement of marrying one of the Æsir based on his feet but mistakenly
chooses the most beautiful pair which belonged to Njord. Their marriage did not last
and she married Ullr instead. With her scathing nature she leads the Wild Hunt.


Sol (Sun )
Daughter of Mundilfari and brother of Mani, she guides the chariot of the sun, bearing
the magical shield Svalin (Cool) to protect herself from the heat. She is eternally chased
by the wolf Skoll who will consume her before Ragnarok.


Syn (Truth)
The guardian goddess of doorways and love. An attendant of Frigga she guards the door
to her palace, preventing access to those not invited. Once she has decided, nothing
can sway her decision. She presides over law trials and her name is invoked whenever a
decision is to be vetoed 'Syn is against it'.


Thor (The Thunderer)
God of lightning, thunder, craftsmanship, fertility, defence and strength. Thor is the
son of Odin and Jord, and married to Sif. He protects Asgardr from the giants by the
threat of his wondrous hammer Mjollnir and owns a magical belt called Megingjardar
('Strength Increaser') and a flying chariot pulled by two resurrecting goats. He is large
and heavy, preventing him from using the Bifrost Bridge. Rather he leaves Asgardr by
the north and wades through the sea to enter Midgardr. Hot headed he often slays
giants out of pique and is doomed to face the great serpent Jormungand several times
before he final slays it and is slain himself at Ragnarok.


Thrud (Power)
The unusually strong daughter of Thor and Sif. Promised to the dwarf Alvis in exchange
for a deed, Thor cruelly tricked him causing the dwarf to turn to stone. She becomes
one of the Valkeries.


Tyr (The One Handed)
The god of war and honour, he grants victory against the odds to those who deserve it.
He presides over contracts, law cases and assembly votes at the thing. An older god from
before Odin, no one knows where he came from. Tyr bravely agreed to place his hand in
the mouth of Fenrir, when the gods were trying to bind the monstrous wolf, as a guarantee
that Fenrir would be released if he could not break free; Tyr fully understanding that he
was sacrificing his limb. When the gods betrayed their side of the bargain, Tyr had his
hand bitten off but considered it a worthy exchange in order to keep the evil wolf bound.


Ullr (The Brilliant One)
The god of archery and skiing, Ullr is the patron of hunters. The step-son of Thor from
a previous marriage of Sif, Ullr is one of the Vanir. His name comes from the Aurora
Borealis, which lights up the heavens when he rules in Asgardr in the winter.


Vali
The son of Odin and the giantess Rind. He was birthed solely to avenge the death of Balder.


Valkyries, the (Choosers of the Slain)
The disir sent to select those warriors fallen in battle worthy of being brought to
Valhalla, or serve the Einherjar in the evening banquets. Also known as Shield Maidens
or Corpse Goddesses, they can shape-shift as swans or ravens, or they ride through the
sky armed and armoured aback their horses.

Then light shone from Logafell, and from that radiance there came bolts of lightning;
wearing helmets at Himingvani. Their byrnies were drenched in blood;
and rays shone from their spears.

The number and names of the Valkyrjur fluctuate but the core ones are: 'Hrist and
Mist I desire should bring me a horn, Skeggjöld and Skogul, Hildr and Thrudr, Hlokk
and Herfjotur, Goll and Geirahod, Randgridr and Reginleif. These serve ale to the
Einheriar. Gunnr and Rota and the youngest norn, called Skuld, always ride to choose
who shall be slain and to govern the killings.'


Var (Awareness)
The goddess of oaths and marriage vows. A handmaiden of Frigga she punishes those
who break their oaths, especially those between men and women.


Ve (Holy)
Son of Bor and brother of Odin and Vili. He granted mankind perception.


Vidar
Son of Odin and the giantess Grid who will avenge Odin's death after Ragnarok.


Vili (Will)
Son of Bor and brother of Odin and Ve. He gave mankind thought and motion.


Vor (Insightful)
The goddess of inquisitive perception, with Var she is a handmaiden of Frigga and
helps punish those who break vows.


Divine Gifts
Games Masters who wish to run a heroic fantasy or a mythic Viking campaign can
grant their players a Divine Gift, something they are born with which helps boost their
natural capabilities. In the sagas are many examples of royal lines with traces of divine
blood in their veins. Some of the greatest heroes appear to be superhuman, such as the
unmatched strength of Beowulf, being able to wrestle Grendel. Other blessings are the
immunities of berserks who use no Seidr or magic to gain their protections.

The following gifts can have a significant effect on a game, potentially bringing some
imbalance to the difficulties faced by a party of diverse Adventurers. Care should
be taken to craft challenges so that they are targeted for a single Adventurer, so that
they do not inadvertently slaughter the group or leave one person feeling bored with
nothing taxing their capabilities.

Each of these gifts is a single exclusive power that can only be taken during Adventurer
generation. They are not intended to be stacked together. Saying that, these powers
could potentially be duplicated by some gift of magical effect during a campaign,
drinking from the Well of Mimir for example might replicate the gift of Sagacity.


Gifts of the Gods
Each of the following powers is either considered permanently active, such as a Characteristic
increase, or costs the user a single Magic Point to activate with no chance of failure.

Agility
The gift increases the recipient's DEX to his maximum rolled value plus an additional 1D6.

Allurement
The gift increases the recipient's CHA to his maximum rolled value plus an additional 1D6.

Animal Tongue
The recipient can understand the speech of the birds and animals. What they say might
not be particularly interesting however.

Bear Skin
The recipient owns a magical bear skin, which provides him with 7 Armour Points all
over his body but only has a Strike Rank Penalty of –5. This protection only counts
against iron weapons or fire and is treated as a normal bear skin against other types of
damage (3 points). If the skin is lost, then if the Adventurer kills and skins another bear
single-handedly, the new skin adopts the same powers.

Beguiling Voice
For the investment of a Magic Point the user can force everyone within audible range to
turn and pay attention to the user, captivated by the tone and power of their voice. The
user must first succeed in an unopposed Influence, Oratory, Poetry or Sing test to captivate
his audience, after which he can retain their focus for as long as they can continue the
performance. An aggressive action automatically breaks the effect of his voice.

Breathe Water
The recipient can breathe water as if it were air. They can still be strangled however if
their windpipe is blocked.

Darksight
The recipient gains the Night Sight trait.

Endurance
The gift increases the recipient's

Ferocity
When fighting the recipient enters a berserk rage. During this time they may ignore
any Resilience tests to resist wounds. Note that if they receive a Major Wound they still
become incapacitated but ignore the chance of instant death or losing a limb.

Immune to Fear
The recipient automatically succeeds in any test against fear, magical or otherwise.

Lucky
Before any skill is rolled the user may spend a Magic Point to get an additional roll,
picking the best result.

Natural Shape-shifter
The user may choose an animal whose average SIZ Characteristic value is no more
than twice their own. The user can then change into that form at will, for the cost of
a single Magic Point. Changing requires a single Combat Action and causes all the
possessions of the changer to drop or split off from their body. The duration of the
change is unlimited and there is no risk of losing their personality. The animal form
has no additional protection other than its natural skin but retains any unusual forms
of locomotion, perception or breathing it might have.

Rime Blooded
The recipient is immune to cold of any form.

Sagacity
The gift increases the recipient's INT to his maximum rolled value plus an additional 1D6.

Second Sight
The recipient gains a continual ability to see spirits and magic.

Strength
The gift increases the recipient's STR to his maximum rolled value plus an additional 1D6.

Swift Footed
This gift allows the user to run like the wind. Their natural movement rate is twice
normal.

Vitality
The recipient cannot become ill or sick. In addition they never lose any Fatigue.

Wind Wise
The recipient can knot winds into pieces of rope or leather bags. Using the gift
temporarily ties up Magic Points for each wind so captured but the wind is trapped
within the knot, causing a calm for kilometres in all directions. If the knot or bag is
undone, that wind is released anew and the Magic Points can henceforth regenerate.

Wolf Coat
Similar to the Bear Skin gift, a Wolf Coat only provides 6 Armour Points all over but
has no Strike Rank penalty. The protection only counts against iron or fire, being
considered a normal wolf skin against other forms of damage (2 points). Likewise the
coat can be replaced if the Adventurer kills and skins the leader of a wolf pack single-
handedly. CON to his maximum rolled value plus an additional 1D6.


                                 Viking Magic
Magic is a fundamental aspect of Viking superstition. Their world is filled with witches
and sorcerers who can sing spells, rune carvers that can cut mystical symbols into
charms, seers whom can foretell the future, shaman from the far north that summon
the spirits and even shape-shifters who take on the form of animals.

In addition to these practitioners are numerous supernatural creatures, which have
magical abilities beyond the understanding of common men. Even the gods use magic
and possess enchanted items of wondrous power. Magic is everywhere.

Despite this prevalence, magic is generally regarded with suspicion. Using magic to
defeat or curse one's enemies is not regarded as 'manly'; a good Viking should settle his
problems openly with a sword, not secretly with a spell. As such many practitioners of
the magical arts are regarded with fear, forcing many to keep their skills hidden. Only
in the courts of jarls and kings are such folk tolerated, bound by oaths to serve their
lord and not use their powers maliciously. Outside this protection and bond, they are
forced to live at the edges of the wilderness outcast from society.

Magical artefacts are regarded in a slightly different light, as most are simply tools
of supernatural power, which could gain their own fame. Some items however, have
wicked reputations, cursed by their makers or the dying breath of those who owned
them previously. Tyrfing is such a weapon, a sword that always takes the life of a man
whenever drawn and fated to cause three great evils.

In Vikings of Legend the arts of Common Magic, Divine Magic and Sorcery are not used.
To replace them, several new types of magic are introduced in this chapter. Spirit Magic
remains but with a few minor changes to reflect the practices used in the Viking Age.


Using Magic in Viking Campaigns
A number of options are available to Games Masters when designing a Viking
campaign. These should be carefully considered since the result can radically change
the feel of the game

Historical Campaigns
If running a real world historical campaign, magic of course does not work. However,
since most spells have little or no observable effect, Vikings witnessing rituals and
incantations may still believe in the magic. In such situations the spell casting roll can
be used to determine how believable the incantation was and whether the recipient of
the magic suffers a psychosomatic effect.

For example, using a galdr to instil cowardliness in someone or giving a spurious prophesy
of their doom, might actually result in the mechanical effects of a Demoralise spell.

Using magic in this way requires a delicate touch, since the effect can often be rather
abstract and requires the player of an Adventurer affected by superstition to play along,
regardless of the knowledge that it is potentially not real.

Playing of sorcerers or seers in historical campaigns can be an interesting challenge,
since Adventurers must ply the beliefs of those they cast magic on. Indeed, clever
application of psychology can result in effects greater than any 'true' spell, a single
doom-saying twisting the result of an entire battle for instance!


Fantasy Campaigns
In fantasy Viking campaigns magic is rare but potent. Adventurers are still based in
the real world but spells should work as described later in this chapter. This can add a
great deal of atmosphere to a game, especially considering how common folk fear and
respect the paranormal.

Games Masters must consider the effects of including a magic user in their adventuring
parties. Since magic is relatively unusual, a simple spell can potentially have an
overwhelming effect with no counter spells or matching magics to neutralise it.

If one of the players is running a magic user, enemy sorcerers and supernatural creatures
should be drawn to them as an infrequent occurrence to give some degree of challenge.
In addition the Adventurer will attract a degree of infamy for their powers, making life
difficult for both himself and his fellows. Conversely, Viking parties who lack a magic
user can be augmented with the loan of rune charms or spirit fetishes to aid them in
difficult adventures.


Mythic Campaigns
Mythic campaigns are those which take place across the other worlds of Scandinavian
cosmology, allowing Adventurers to meet – or even be related to – the gods, aiding
them in their battles against the giants.

In mythological games magic should be commonplace. Wondrous treasures, shape-shifting
and oracular visions abound. Every Adventurer should know a few charms or own an item
of power to be able to handle the monstrous challenges present in the nine worlds.


The Source of Magic
Magic comes from the Runes. They are the source of all wisdom and authority, existing
from before the world began and will continue beyond the destruction of Ragnarok.

Such are their power that Odin quested long and hard to find and master them. He
sacrificed an eye to drink from the well of wisdom, before sacrificing himself on the
world tree Yggdrasil – hanging upside-down for nine days, impaled by his own spear –
until the Runes appeared to him.

Now is answered what you ask of the runes, 
Graven by the gods, 
Made by the All Father, 
Sent by the powerful sage:
It is best for man to remain silent. 

Although there are many forms of shamanism and Scandinavian sorcery, ultimately
they are just alternative paths to tap the same powers. Similar 'magical effects' can
be conjured with a ritual chant, a rune carved piece of bone or summoning the right
spirit. It is the way that these runes are invoked which differs.

Contrary to popular belief, a single Rune does not necessarily convey any power; it is
their combination that invokes the magic. Charms and spells mentioned in the eddas
often refer to the runes in plural. For example, in Egil's Saga a curse is carved on a
nidsong (scorn-post) in runes and the heroic poem Sigrdrífumal tells of 'victory runes'
to be carved on a blade 'some on the grasp and some on the inlay and name Tyr twice'.

The following runes are attributed to the Younger Futhark, which are those runic
symbols in use during the Viking Age. Each has its own name and realm of effect,
which can be extrapolated to be more inclusive. Game Masters can use these looser
interpretations to assign individual charms with particular rune combinations.

Younger Furthark Runes
Name             Meaning          Suggested Magical Resonance
Fe               wealth           silver, cattle, land
Ur               iron             weapons, bull, beast
Thurs            giant            Thor, battle
As               Æsir             the gods, authority, law
Reidh            ride             horse, movement, ship
Kaun             ulcer            curse, pain, unhappiness
Hagall           hail             wind, storms, destruction
Naudhr           need             desire, lust, greed
Is               ice              cold, dark, hunger
Ar               plenty           happiness, fertility
Sol              sun              warmth, fire
Tyr              battle           victory, justice, honour
Bjarkan          birch            rebirth, healing, growth
Madhr            man              emotion
Logr             water            sea, lake, rain
Yr               yew              poison

Although the Runes are the keys to invoking magic, the energy to manifest a spell
comes from the sorcerer. Each person has their own hamingja, which is their personal
reserve of mystical power or, in Legend terms, their Magic Points. The Vikings think of
hamingja as a type of fiery energy.


The Forms of Viking Magic
The magic recorded in the Viking eddas and sagas is, like their supernatural creatures,
a perplexing mess of conflicting ideas, names and traditions. This confusion makes it
difficult to model Scandinavian magic with any accuracy. For example, depending on
the author Seidr can be considered to include summoning spirits, herbalism, prophesy,
channelling the gods, shape-shifting and even spell chanting.

To greatly simplify things, Viking magic in this book has been roughly grouped into
the following five categories.

*	   Rune Carving: Invoking the runes by carving them into enduring physical charms.
*	   Seidr: The verbal incantation of runes either by chanting or singing.
*	   Shape-shifting: Physically changing form with the use of animal skins.
*	   Spa: Prophesy using personal intuition, casting runes or questioning the dead.
*	   Spirit Magic: Shamanistic summoning and propitiating the spirits of nature for aid.

Magical practitioners are not limited to only one form of magic. Several different skills
may be learned to enable a sorcerer to become more diverse, although finding a teacher
to learn new techniques may take an involved series of undertakings into the other
worlds to prove dedication and loyalty. Many sorcerers in the Sagas venture to far off
places, where the Lapps or giants live, to learn magic from them.

To limit the potentially explosive growth of magical ability, each new charm, rune
carving or spirit learned by an Adventurer should cost Improvement Rolls. Since magic
is rare in the fantastical Viking Age, the recommended cost of learning new 'spells'
should be set at between three and five Improvement Rolls for each one, at the Games
Master's discretion.

Some forms of magic are considered to be feminine in nature, Seidr and Spa especially.
Men can wield these arts but at risk to their reputation and manhood. Rune Carving
on the other hand, is normally the province of men.


'Odin had the skill which gives great power and which he practiced himself. It is called seidr,
and by means of it he could know the fate of a man and predict events that had not yet come to
pass; and by it he could also inflict bane on men, or loss of soul or waning health, or also take
wit or power from some men, and give them to others. But this sorcery is attended by such ergi
(effeminacy) that manly men considered it shameful to practice it, and so it was taught to priestesses.'

- Ynglinga Saga



Seidr Magic
Roughly translatable as witchcraft, the practitioners of Seidr are called seidkona or
seidman. These titles generally have a negative connotation because of the harm that
this form of magic can cause.

'Shun a woman, wise in magic, 
Her bed and her embraces:
If she cast a spell, you will care no longer 
To meet and speak with men, 
Desire no food, desire no pleasure, 
In sorrow fall asleep.'

Generally speaking, using seidr involves chanting or singing spells called galdr. There
are many forms of galdrar, in the poem Havamal, Odin claims to have mastered 18
different galdrar, amongst which are many incantations to protect against iron or fire,
loosen fetters, snare arrows out of the air or calm storms (see text box). In other sagas
there are charms that can raise the dead to fight again, ease the pains of childbirth, drive
someone mad or even cast illusions.

Seidr is often performed under the cover of a cloak or whilst sitting on a tall seat or
platform called a seidhjallr. The top is reached by nine steps, nine being a magical
number, the steps representing the nine worlds. Skalds were said to sometimes weave
magic into their songs.

The greatest masters of Seidr are the elfs and gods themselves, whose skill is such that
they can invoke galdr in mere moments rather than spend minutes in clumsy ritualistic
preparation, as mortals must.

Seidr (Pow x 2)
This Advanced skill is used to cast galdrar (verbal incantations) using ritual chants sung
or spoken in a high pitched voice. The magic draws its power from the sound of the
Runes, their vibrations conjuring mystical effects. Although Seidr and Rune Carving
share the same base spells, their implementation is subtly different. A combined list of
suggested Galdrar and Galdrastafir (mystic symbols) follows Rune Carving.


The List of Charms
The following exert is known as the Ljodatal, from the poem Havamal. It describes a list of
charms know by Odin as recounted by himself. It gives a wide range of magical incantations,
which are the source of much of the magic portrayed in the eddas and sagas. These are the basis
for both Seidr and Rune Carving magic.

To cast a galdr the user must make a successful test of their Seidr skill. The success level
and value rolled on the dice are used as the target number to beat if the spell can be
resisted.

Successfully casting a galdr costs one Magic Point per point of Magnitude. Critically
succeeding costs a single Magic Point less, Failure costs nothing and Fumbling costs
the full amount but nothing happens. For progressive spells the user can select at what
level of Magnitude the galdr is cast.

The casting time for galdr is far longer than is useful in a tactical situation. For each
Magic Point in the spell, the caster must chant for a full minute. To compensate for this
extensive preparation, the range of a galdr is effectively unlimited; save that it cannot cross
large bodies of water and the caster must personally know or have an object belonging to
the target. Thus a curse cast by a seidkona on Iceland could affect someone still on the
island or one of its coastal islets but not a target in Norway for example.

The duration of a galdr, where applicable, is usually a day and a night. So, for instance,
a hero could be ensorcelled with protective wards prior to fighting a battle the following
day, or an enemy cursed with fear so that he will not turn up at a law case until it has
ended. If desired, a successfully cast galdr can be ceased at any time prior to its natural
termination.

Galdr require the user to openly chant its incantation. Gagging a seidr wielder or
placing a hood over their heads will prevent them from further casting.

The number of galdr a user can learn is equal to one tenth of their Siedr skill (rounded
up). Each time their skill raises enough to allow the attainment of a new galdr, they
must spend a number of Improvement Rolls (as discussed previously) to gain it. These
galdr never change once learned.

Once a galdr has been absorbed, the maximum Magnitude at which it can be cast is
equal to the lower of either: the caster's INT divided by three (rounded up) or the user's
Seidr skill divided by 20 (also rounded up).

For example Bjorn with a Seidr of 84% and an intelligence of 11 can cast any galdr he
knows at a maximum of Magnitude of 4. Technically his skill would allow him to cast
it at Magnitude 5 but his mind is incapable of manipulating it at that level.


Rune Carving Magic
Know how to cut them, know how to read them, 
Know how to stain them, know how to prove them, 
Know how to evoke them, know how to score them,
Know how to send them; know how to spend them

- Havamal


Rune Carving is effectively the skill of invoking the power of the Runes by engraving
or marking their physical shapes into objects, rather than singing them aloud. Such
inscriptions are mystical sigils, which are known as Galdrastafir and the item so
enchanted is called a Taufr or talisman.

Practitioners skilled in the magical lore of the runes were known as Vitki, which means
a 'wizard' or 'magician' and Vitkar a wise woman. There was great danger involved in
carving runes, for incomplete knowledge could cause more harm than good.

Those who carve without knowledge
Should not write the runes
Great misfortune will follow
When the secrets are misused
I have seen ten letters carved
Out of a bent bone
They brought on the pain
That tortured the young girl.

Rune Carving can be performed on any solid surface the caster can incise. This can be
stone or metal but due to the nature of investing one's own magical strength into such
talismans, these types of rune carving are generally avoided. Horn, bone, ivory or wood
are more preferable substances to use for enchantments, being light in weight and thus
easy to transport, simple to whittle the runes into and, most importantly, capable of
being broken.

In actual fact a talisman need not be carved at all. A few practitioners, such as some
of the Rus, tattoo galdrastafir into their own skin. This is a dangerous path for Rune
Carvers since it makes the removal of their enchantments somewhat painful but it does
ensure that their charms can never be accidentally lost or stolen. Some Viktar are even
able to weave or embroider galdrastafir into clothing, the shirt of Arrow Odd being a
particularly powerful example, protecting him from the cold, drowning, fire, hunger
and iron!

Although the spells that can be crafted are effectively identical to Galdrar incantations,
carving charms has the benefit of making the magic permanent but at the expense of
weakening the enchanter.

Many rune carvings were used to curse enemies rather than provide protection, healing
or aid. Famous examples of these are Niding Poles, or Scorn-Posts, which were tall
poles carved with runic insults and banes. An animal head or skull, usually that of a
horse, was fixed atop the pole and it was enchanted with a ceremony to give it power.

By far the most skilful rune carvers are the dwarfs. Their mastery is such that they can
craft wondrous weapons and artefacts unachievable by the mortals and gods alike.


'And when all was ready for sailing, Egil went up into the island. He took in his hand a
hazel-pole, and went to a rocky eminence that looked inward to the mainland. Then he took
a horse's head and fixed it on the pole. After that, in solemn form of curse, he thus spake:
'Here set I up a curse-pole, and this curse I turn on king Eric and queen Gunnhilda. (Here
he turned the horse's head landwards.) This curse I turn also on the guardian-spirits who
dwell in this land, that they may all wander astray, nor reach or find their home till they
have driven out of the land king Eric and Gunnhilda.' This spoken, he planted the pole
down in a rift of the rock, and let it stand there. The horse's head he turned inwards to the
mainland; but on the pole he cut runes, expressing the whole form of curse.'

- Egil's Saga



Rune Carving (Pow+Dex)
Rune Carving is an Advanced skill used to create magical talismans. It covers the
etching and enchanting of runic inscriptions into an object, which is powered by
the temporary sacrifice of the caster's own Magic Points. A list of possible galdrastafir
(mystic symbols) follows this section.

To create a talisman the user must make a successful test of their Rune Carving skill.
The success level and value rolled on the dice are used as the target number to beat
if the spell has been carved to deleteriously affect a target and the victim wishes to
resist it.

Successfully enchanting a galdrastafir into a talisman costs a number of Magic Points
equal to half its Magnitude (rounded up). Critically succeeding allows the cost to be
rounded down (minimum of one MP), Failure costs nothing and Fumbling costs the
full amount but the enchantment is unsuccessful.

If the enchantment succeeded then the Magic Points invested in the talisman do not
regenerate until the Rune Carving has been sundered. Or to put it another way, the
rune carver's Magic Points are permanently reduced by the number of points that went
into creating the talisman, until the magic of that Rune Carving is ended.

The crafting time for a talisman is extensive. If carving the runes into a relatively soft
substance such as bone or wood, the enchanter must spend one hour for each point of
Magnitude in the spell. Carving runes onto hard substances such as stone, or tattooing
or weaving galdrastafir, takes one day per Magnitude.

In return for significantly weakening their magical strength a rune carved talisman
grants the following benefits:
*	 The power of the talisman is permanent, unless the galdrastafir has an instantaneous
effect, in which case the spell remains on 'standby' until activated by the talisman's user.
*	 The magic of a beneficial talisman transfers to whomever holds it.
*	 The range of an offensive talisman is effectively unlimited – save that it cannot
cross large bodies of water – as long as the caster personally knows the target of the
curse or the talisman is formed from an object belonging to them.
*	 The talisman remains enchanted even after its creator's death.

Once a talisman has been created it can only be undone if the object upon which the
runes are carved is broken. Talismans containing instantaneous spells automatically
sunder themselves once their effect has been used. After an enchantment has been
unravelled, the Magic Points originally invested in it can slowly regenerate.

The number of galdrastafir an enchanter can learn is equal to one tenth of their Rune
Carving skill (rounded up). Each time their skill raises enough to allow the attainment
of a new spell, they must spend a number of Improvement Rolls (as described earlier)
to gain it. Once learned the galdrastafir can never be changed.

The maximum Magnitude at which a galdrastafir can be enchanted is equal to the
lower of either: the caster's INT divided by three (rounded up) or the user's Rune
Carving skill divided by 20 (also rounded up).


Galdrar and Galdrastafir
Literally chants and magical signs, the following spells can be cast using either the
Seidr or Rune Carving skill. They use the following traits, which are slightly different,
depending on whether the spell is cast as a chant or engraved as runes.

Enduring: If cast as Seidr the spell's effect lasts for a day and a night, or vice versa. If a
Rune Carving then the spell lasts until the enchanted object is broken.

Instant: The spell's effect takes place instantly and then disappears. Instant spells
enchanted as Rune Carvings work once (at a time of the owner's choice) and then
shatter.

Magnitude (X): The strength and power of the spell. Also the number of Magic Points
required to cast it (or half this value if engraved). If two identical spells are cast on the
same target, only the stronger takes effect. They do not stack.

Progressive: If desired the spell can be cast at greater levels of Magnitude, increasing its
Magic Point cost commensurately.

Resist (Persistence/Resilience): The spell's effects do not take effect automatically.
The target may make an Opposed Test of their Persistence or Resilience (as specified
by the spell) against the casting roll, in order to avoid the effect of the spell entirely.

Galdrar usually only have a single recipient, either the caster themselves or a target;
have unlimited range overland; and require no concentration to use. Spells which
divert from this default mention the change specifically in their description.


Animate Dead
Enduring, Progressive

Raises up freshly slain bodies to continue fighting after death. The number of corpses
that can be simultaneously controlled is equal to the Magnitude of the spell. Corpses
retain their original Characteristics and skills but must be literally dismembered or
decapitated to cease being a threat. If a corpse is rendered non-functional, the magic
can transfer to a new dead body in better shape.

Bar Spirit
Enduring, Progressive

Keeps unwelcome spirits at bay, preventing the recipient from being Discorporated,
attacked in Spirit Combat or Possessed. The magic blocks spirits of up to 6 POW per
point of Magnitude. Thus a Magnitude 4 Bar Spirit could block spirits of up to 24
POW.

Battle Fetter
Enduring, Magnitude Special, Resist (Persistence)

Also known as 'Weaken Courage' the target of this spell loses any hope of victory and
suffers a terrible panic. They will try to avoid fighting and faced with battle will either
run or surrender. If forced into a situation where they have no option left but to defend
themselves, the target continues to defend at its full skill but only attacks at half (before
modifiers) and may not cast or invoke magic. The effects of this spell are automatically
cancelled by the Inspire Bravery spell and vice versa.

The Magnitude of the spell depends on the target: 1 for an animal, 2 for a person and
3 for a supernatural being.

Bind Form
Enduring, Magnitude 1, Resist (Resilience)

Prevents a shape-shifter from switching forms for the duration of the magic, thus
trapping them in human or animal shape.

Blunt Weapon
Enduring, Progressive, Resist (Resilience)

This spell is a type of curse which is cast at a person, rather than his accoutrements.
For every point of Magnitude, it reduces the damage dealt from any weapon, wielded
by the target, by two.


Break Charm
Instant, Progressive

Break Charm is used to dismiss another galdr, rune carving or similar magic. The
targeted spell is nullified if its own Magnitude is equalled or exceed by that of the Break
Charm. Successfully using this spell against a talisman causes the rune carved object
to sunder.

Calm Passion
Enduring, Magnitude 1, Resist (Persistence)

Removes hatred, fear, worry, loathing or any other form of strong emotion from the
target. If the target does not wish to be calmed then they are permitted a Resistance roll.

Deflect Arrow
Enduring, Magnitude 1

Allows the recipient to catch or deflect missile weapons. Catching requires a successful
parry using their Unarmed skill. Deflecting can be done with any weapon, assuming a
successful parry using the appropriate Combat Style.

Divine Wisdom
Enduring, Progressive

Calls upon the wisdom of the Æsir and Alfar to guide the caster, who receives such
knowledge as a vision or dream. Each point of Magnitude adds a 10% bonus to a single
Lore or Craft skill. The skill to be affected must be stated at the time of casting.

Dominate Being
Enduring, Magnitude Special, Resist (Persistence)

Controls the actions of the target, subverting their free will. The Magnitude of the spell
depends on the target: 1 for an animal, 2 for a person and 3 for a supernatural being.
The spell cannot affect gods or singular monsters such as Garm or Fenris.

Failing to resist the spell places the target completely under the mental will of the
caster. However, forcing the target to perform a morally repugnant deed or act against
its instincts grants a new opposed roll to break free. Blatantly suicidal commands
automatically sever the control. Once the domination has been sundered the spell
ends, leaving the victim (if intelligent) aware of being magically manipulated but not
necessarily of whom the caster was.

If the spell is cast when standing or immersed in the waters of a sea or lake, then it can
reach targets that reside in that body of water.

Ease Pain
Enduring, Progressive

Eases the debilitating pain-related effects of wounds, poisons or child birth. Each point
of Magnitude adds a 10% bonus to Resilience tests. A warrior blessed by this charm
can be a steadfast opponent, continuing to fight until maimed or killed outright.

Entrance Other
Enduring, Magnitude Special, Resist (Persistence)

Charms the target to feel feelings of love or loyalty towards the user of this spell. The
effects are subtle leaving the person or creature its free will but always biased in favour
of the caster and unaware of their enthrallment. The Magnitude of Entrance Other
depends on the target: 1 for an animal, 2 for a person and 3 for a supernatural being.

Evil Eye
Enduring, Progressive, Resist (Resilience)

Produces one or more irritable blights, which haunt the target as if plagued by bad luck.
The curse includes one effect for each point of Magnitude in the spell. The effects can be
selected or rolled randomly. Use the following table to generate random consequences.

Fog Mind
Enduring, Progressive, Resist (Persistence)

Causes forgetfulness in the target. If the spell is not resisted, the caster can force the
recipient to forget one 'thing' per point of Magnitude. The magic is quite versatile,
allowing diverse application. A three point Fog Mind spell cast on the local ruler could
for example, cause him to temporarily forget that a) he is the Jarl, b) he had exiled his
brother for treachery and c) he was to muster his army to fight a battle that day. Lost
memories return once the spell ends.

Free Fetter
Instant, Magnitude Special

Removes chains, bonds or any form of restraint from the recipient. The Magnitude of the
spell depends on the type of binding used: 1 for leather or rope ties, 2 for metal chains, 3
for stone prisons and 4 or more for magical fetters – for instance the dwarf forged chain
Loding may require Magnitude 4, with Dromi 5 and Gleipnir 6 respectfully.

Grant Victory
Enduring, Progressive

Calls upon the favour of Tyr and Odin to make the user more fearsome in battle. This
spell adds +5% per point of Magnitude to the recipient's weapon skills. It does not
increase damage.

18     Rotting Touch        Equipment, clothing and stored foods quickly rot.
19     Sickly Livestock     All animals owned slowly sicken and die.
20     Sour Taste           Everything eaten or drunk tastes foul, forcing a
                         Resilience roll to keep it down.


Grow Strong
Enduring, Progressive

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the recipient's STR score increases by +2.
This may have an additional effect on skills and Attributes, such as Damage Modifier.
The target's STR cannot be raised to more than twice its original value.

Heal Wound
Enduring, Progressive

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the caster can repair one Hit Point of
damage to an injured Hit Location. The healing takes the entire day and night of the
duration to complete. If the spell is terminated early, it grants a number of Hit Points
in proportion to the time spent. For instance a Heal Wound 3, which is stopped after
16 hours only heals two Hit Points of damage.

Heal Wound works equally well whether cast on animals, people or supernatural beings
but only affects Minor or Serious Wounds. Major Wounds such as severed or maimed
limbs cannot be repaired with this magic; even the gods themselves cannot heal such
wounds.

Hold Fast
Enduring, Progressive

This charm is used to stick things together or bind someone with magical fetters.
When cast on an innocuous object, the next thing that touches it is held fast, unable to
break the contact save with magic. If used to ensorcell bonds, the knots or clasps seal
tight and cannot be undone.

This spell can be used to entrap unsuspecting victims, by casting it on a chair for
example. Loki was once caught by this magic when visiting the hall of the giant Geirrod
in falcon form, when his claws were held fast to a window ledge.

Inspire Bravery
Enduring, Magnitude Special, Resist (Persistence)

The target of this spell becomes fearless and unheeding of personal danger. The
recipient's attacks with close combat skills are increased by half but they cannot
attempt to evade, parry or invoke any magical gifts or spells. The effects of this spell are
automatically cancelled by the Weaken Courage spell and vice versa. Willing targets of
Fanaticism may surrender to the spell without resisting it.

The Magnitude of the spell depends on the target: 1 for an animal, 2 for a person and
3 for a supernatural being.

Instil Madness
Enduring, Magnitude 2, Resist (Persistence)

The target of the spell becomes mentally unstable, undermining their status and
reputation. The mental problems begin subtly but are chronic enough to cause severe
problems to their family or associates. This madness does not result in mindless
psychopathic or suicidal tendencies but should be viewed as a way of ruining someone's
life. The precise type of madness or insanity is up to the Games Master to decide, or a
roll can be made on the following table.


Random Madness Table
1D8       Symptom                Explanation
1         Hallucinations         Begin to hear and see things which are not there.
2         Paranoia               Everyone and everything is out to get you.
3         Anxiety                Panic attacks when faced with stressful situations.
4         Withdrawal             No longer express any interest in life.
5         Distracted             Cannot concentrate or complete any task.
6         Aggressive             Become constantly angry and irritable.
7         Irrational             Act in a random and contrary manner.
8         Delusional             Lose touch with reality.

Propitiate Gods
Instant, Magnitude 3

A simple ritual that helps avert any disfavour from supernatural beings. The spell
requires granting a sacrifice to the spirit or deity being propitiated. The result is either
the withdrawal of any hostile feelings from the entity, or a vision in which the being
shows what is wrong and how it may be fixed.

Quench Flame
Enduring, Progressive

A protective charm that protects the recipient from the effects of heat and flames. For
every point of Magnitude of this spell, the effect of any fire is reduced by one step.

Question Dead
Enduring, Progressive

Permits the caster to ask a dead body as many questions as points of Magnitude
invested in the spell. The corpse can only answer about subjects it knows about and
must respond truthfully. For more abstract knowledge a roll can be made against a dead
person's Lore skill. If the corpse does not know the answer, it still uses up one of the
questions. The spell still works if cast on a severed head.

Reflect Charm
Enduring, Progressive

Any hostile spell of equal or less Magnitude than the Reflect Charm is turned back
against its caster, who must resist their own magic if applicable. If the hostile spell has a
greater Magnitude then it affects the recipient of the Reflect Charm as normal.

Remain Unseen
Enduring, Progressive

Known in Norse as the Helmet of Hiding (hulidshjalmr), this spell causes the recipient
to fade from notice. For every point of Magnitude of this spell, Perception skills used
to locate the recipient are reduced by 10%.

Second Sight
Enduring, Magnitude 1

Allows sight of supernatural creatures and the fylgjur (animal soul) of people. Like
normal vision, Second Sight is blocked by interposing objects or cover. The spell also
allows the normally invisible presence of magic to be perceived, allowing the viewer to
spot enchanted items or curses.

Turn Dead
Enduring, Magnitude 1, Resist (Persistence)

Forces a draugr (or some other form of animated dead) to depart a place of haunting or
sink back into the ground deprived of form, providing it fails to resist the spell.

Ward Injury
Enduring, Progressive

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, one Armour Point is added to every Hit
Location of the caster. This stacks with any existing armour and is treated in the same
manner for the purposes of the Bypass Armour Combat Manoeuvre.

This protection however, is only effective against a particular type of material. The
sagas often mention charms that protect against iron, stopping swords and glaives
but have no effect against stone tipped arrows or unarmed grappling. This spell can
be cast several times on the same recipient, each Ward Injury affecting a different
substance.

Weather Charm
Enduring, Progressive

Raises or lowers the strength of the wind and cloud cover by one step per Magnitude
(see Weather tables on page 232 of the Legend Core Rulebook). The modified conditions
are local (several kilometres) around the caster or the target the weather is sent against.
If the caster wishes to manipulate weather over water, they must be present in or on
the same lake or sea.


Weave Illusion
Enduring, Progressive

Hides the reality of the target from the senses of all observers. A target of up to 20 SIZ
may be affected for each point of Manipulation. Thus a person can be hidden with a
Magnitude 1 spell, whereas a horse requires Magnitude 2. Once an illusion (sjonhverfing)
has ended it cannot be repeated in the same form but must change its nature on the next
casting. The charm of Second Sight can immediately perceive any illusion for what it is.


Spa Magic
Spa is a form of divination. Commonly called spa-craft or spae-craft it allows its user
to determine 'that which was, is and will be' by using dreams, intuition or mystical
enlightenment. In effect, spa allows the user to glimpse or know the wyrd or orlog (fate)
of persons as woven by the Norns.

Practitioners of spa-craft are normally women. They are called spakona (spa woman) or
volva (prophetess). Of all the magical artisans, the seeress is by far the highest honoured
in Viking society, often invited to the courts of jarls and kings. Indeed two of the most
respected goddesses, Sif and Frigga, are noted spakona.

The divinations of skilled volva are so accurate that even Odin himself seeks their
knowledge, once using his power over the dead to interrogate a volva in her grave.

Spakona often dress in ritualised clothing to proclaim their abilities. The following
excerpt from Egil's Saga describes a seeress in her full regalia. Of note are the blue cloak,
the colour of death and catskin mantle and gloves, the cat being sacred to Freyja.

'She came in the evening with the man who had been sent to meet her, then she was dressed
like this, so that she had a blue mantle fastened with straps, and stones were set all in the
flap above; on her neck she had glass beads, a black lambskin hood on her head with white
catskin inside; and she had a staff in her hand with a knob on it; it was made with brass
and stones were set above in the knob; she had a belt of touch-wood, and on it was a large
skin pouch, and there she kept safe her talismans which she needed to get knowledge. She had
on her feet shaggy calfskin shoes with long thongs and large knobs on the ends of those. She
had on her hands catskin gloves, and they were white inside and shaggy.'

Divination can be a powerful tool to uncover hidden secrets, know what is happening
elsewhere and foretell forthcoming events.


How to Handle Divinations
'It is time to speak as a thule, on the thule's seat, at the Well of Wyrd;
I saw and was silent, I saw and thought, I listened to the speech of folk;
I heard deeming of runes, and they were not silent of redes,
at the halls of the High One, in the halls of the High One, thus I heard tell'

- Havamal

The power to see things which 'have, are and will' happen, can have a profound effect
on a campaign.

Visions of the past or present are well within the Games Master's ability to control,
releasing enough titbits of information so as to give a spakona, or her petitioners, a
valuable insight towards solving their difficulties.

Unfortunately, prophesying the future in roleplaying games is somewhat impractical.
After all, the Game Master is not omnipotent and the randomness of dice rolls (or
capricious players) can invalidate the simplest prediction.

Whilst Games Masters can use a prophecy as the dramatic basis for a scenario, or
indeed an entire campaign; it can become problematic if the power to prophesise is left
in the hands of an Adventurer. Probably the simplest way of dealing with prophecy is
to keep spakona as minor background figures and never allowing Adventurers to play
to a seer or seeress.

However, to help those who wish high levels of doom ridden divination, the Spa skill
has been designed to shift the onus of creating prophecies from the Game Master to
the player and expands its versatility so that it can be used for insights as well as to set
a foretelling in place.

Once a prophecy has been made, there are several methods of handling its prediction
in a campaign:

*	 Railroad: Since a person's wryd is fixed within the web of fate, the Norns have
already decreed what he must do and suffer. Upholding Viking superstition and
fatalism, a Games Master is fully justified in warping campaign events to fulfil a
prophecy. Strange quirks of fate are the tools the Norns use to ensure everyone
abides by their foretold path.
*	 Self-fulfilling: Perhaps the most difficult type of foretelling to enact, it requires a
careful game of psychological second guessing and manipulation of player actions.
In effect the Games Master presents a prophecy that comes true because of what
the Adventurers do to avoid it. This type of foretelling can be excellent if pulled
off, the players realising that they caused the outcome themselves.
*	 Loose Interpretation: Prophecies that are worded very loosely, using kennings to
further muddy the waters, can be left to their own devices. If done well, a mystical
foretelling can be so open to interpretation that a Games Master can justify the
eventual outcome in any way they like!
*	 Temporary Sidestep: Although even the gods themselves are bound upon the
web of fate, Adventurers can have their doom or prophecy placed on a hiatus
whilst they continue their life adventuring. Orvar-Odd's Saga is a case in point.
Fated to die by his own horse the hero slays it and buries the body seemingly
avoiding his doom. However, years later he passes back by the grave and disturbs
the horse skull he finds there. A viper darts out giving him a fatal bite thus finally
completing his wyrd.

Spa (Pow+Int)
Spa is an Advanced skill used to divine knowledge. With it an Adventurer can see the
past, present or future, allowing them to make prophecies or gain insights into the fate
of a person, family, tribe or nation. Such divinations cannot be resisted by any means
since the orlog of every person is open to those with the power to read it.

The Spa skill is used in the following manner:

*	 The diviner should decide whether they wish to reveal the past, present or future.
*	 The diviner must know the subjects of the oracular ritual personally, or lacking
such a relationship must be given or own an item of personal significance to those
being divined, a blooded shirt or family icon for example. Distance has no effect
on the divination.
*	 Preparation for the divination requires an hour of meditation, chanting or sleep
per Magic Point invested into it.
*	 However the ritual is performed, the result of a divination usually takes the form
of a vision or dream.
*	 It is the Games Master who rolls against the Spa skill to see if the divination
attempt worked.

The Games Master should never reveal the actual roll, since in some cases the vision
may turn out to be completely false. The effect of the roll depends on the level of
success:

*	 A critical success provides a clear vision unequivocally answering the original
questions or showing what will happen.
*	 A normal success gives veiled but truthful results, partially answering the questions
with symbolic allusions or showing a limited version of what will happen.
*	 A failure results in a clouded vision providing no answers, or the sense that the
Norns have hidden the wyrd for some reason. If the failure is a foretelling, this may
undermine the reputation of the diviner.
*	 A fumble appears to be a critical success but grants false information, which will
ultimately turn and harm the questioner – not the seer themselves, unless the seer
was the originator of the enquiry.

Divining the Past: The diviner may reveal the past deeds of an individual or group.
One question may be asked per Magic Point invested in the ritual.

Seeing the Present: The diviner may determine the current status of a person or group.
This ritual costs one Magic Point per piece of information to be revealed, such as the
location, health, wealth, emotion, fears, loves, hatreds, present activity and so on.

Foretelling the Future: The diviner may predict the fate awaiting the subjects. Quite
literally the player chooses what will happen to the persons so affected by the prophecy.
The Magic Point cost can vary dramatically depending on the orlog desired. Build up
the cost by selecting an option from each of the duration, reach and consequence tables
and multiply the values together.

Time Frame of the Prophecy
Magic Points      Time Frame
0                 Prophecy will occur in the lifetime or existence of the subject.
1                 Prophecy will occur within a year.
2                 Prophecy will occur within a month.
3                 Prophecy will occur within a week.

Reach of the Prophecy
Magic Points      Reach
1                 Prophecy will affect a single person.
2                 Prophecy will affect a family or small group.
3                 Prophecy will affect an entire clan, town or settlement.
4                 Prophecy will affect an entire nation or race.
5                 Prophecy will affect the entire world.

Consequence of the Prophecy
Magic Points      Effect
7                 Auspicious Occurrence – Become a jarl or king, inherit great
             wealth, gain a legendary item, win a major battle, survive combats
             un-maimed.
5                 Fortunate Occurrence – Join the household of a jarl or king, make
             a good marriage, win a minor battle, become the owner of land or
             ships, ignore a serious wound.
3                 Beneficial Occurrence – Win a duel, survive next battle, sail the
             seas without sinking, improve your personal wealth, gain an ally.
1                 Neutral Occurrence – Gain a contact, see a natural disaster, talk
             to a hero, travel to a remote place, find a long lost relative.
3                 Adverse Occurrence – Lose some personal wealth, have weapon
             break in hand, be beaten by a rival, fall overboard, horse goes
             lame.
5                 Baleful Occurrence – Lose land or property, succumb to a serious
             wound, defeated by an enemy, become sick, ship sinks, mount
             or livestock dies, family member dies, armour sunders, raided by
             pillagers.
7                 Disastrous Occurrence – Lose kingdom, become maimed, suffers
             a fire and burn down, entire family killed, lose next battle, fleet
             sinks, declared outlaw, closest ally becomes enemy.

Once a prophecy has been divined, it can never be overturned or superseded by later
prophecies. Additionally, until the prophecy has been completed, the Magic Points
invested in the foretelling remain tied up, unable to recover. Thus using a prophecy to
destroy an enemy or promote a companion can weaken the seer for a significant period
of time.

A successful prophesy might guarantee a result but the conclusion must still be earned
by the Adventurer's own efforts, else the glory of the climax may fall to another, turn
out to be a short term boon, or simply be converted into a failed foreseeing.

For example, foretelling that a close friend will become the King of Norway but making
no attempt to engage in politics or raise an army to support the prophecy, may result in the
Adventurer receiving the title of King in his absence – only to immediately lose the position
to an ambitious family rival who was present with his huskarls.

The Spa skill can never be used by the diviner to influence or enquire about their own
fate. Attempting to do so always ends in failure.


Shamanistic Magic
'The two brothers had but left the roadstead, when close beside their ship, up rose a walrus.
Kormak hurled at it a pole-staff, which struck the beast, so that it sank again: but the men
aboard thought that they knew its eyes for the eyes of Thorveig the witch. That walrus came
up no more, but of Thorveig it was heard that she lay sick to death; and indeed folk say that
this was the end of her.'

- Kormaks Saga

Shamanism is an ancient tradition in the Scandinavian lands. The Lapp people are
traditionally shamanists and many tales exist of heroes travelling to the north to learn
secrets from them. In fact many Seidr practitioners also dabble in shamanism since the
Viking world is full of spirits, which not only must be propitiated to ward off their
displeasure but are useful sources of power.

Viking shamanism is very similar to that described in the Legend Core Rulebook but has
a few subtle changes.

Although spirits are capable of granting boons or inflicting terrible curses, they differ
in one respect from normal Legend spirits in that very few are capable of discorporating
a victim and may only do so if the person is sleeping or unconscious. Generally this
requires that they be resting in the place where the spirit resides, as Scandinavian spirits
rarely venture away from their sacred landmarks or herds unless a shaman binds them
to a fetish. If Spirit Combat occurs, it takes the form of a dream or nightmare.

The only spirits available to Scandinavian shaman are Guardian Spirits (Fylgjur and
Disir), Nature Spirits (Landvættir) and Curse Spirits (Mara).

Ancestor Spirits are propitiated but never manifested or bound.

Elemental Spirits are available but take the form of natural events or disasters, such as
a forest fire or winter storm. They can never be physically manifested as a supernatural
creature or within the shaman themselves.


Viking Elemental Spirits
As a general guideline use the following tables to determine the capabilities of an
Elemental Spirit of that POW. These elementals only exist as a natural event or disaster,
or the intangible guardian that protects against these occurrences.

Elemental spirits are capable of either harm or protection. If facing a natural calamity of its
own type, an unbound elemental spirit can reduce the severity of the event by its own strength.

Earth Spirits
The following effects are cumulative. For instance if a POW 22 earth spirit causes
three separate effects that victims must resist; falling over, being struck by terror and
suffering physical damage.

POW          Extent         Manifestation
1D6+6        1m diameter    Localised ground tremor that requires unopposed
                       Athletics rolls to remain standing.
1D6+12       10m diameter Violent ground shakes that require an unopposed
                       Persistence roll to not suffer terror as per the spell
                       Battle Fetter.
1D6+18       100m diameter Earthquake that causes trees to topple, buildings to
                       collapse and boulders to roll free, requiring an unopposed
                       Evade roll to avoid 2D6 damage to 1D3 locations.
1D6+24       1 km diameter Minor landslide or avalanche that requires an
                       unopposed Brawn roll to escape being trapped.
1D6+30       10 km diameter Major landslide or avalanche that requires an unopposed
                       Resilience roll to survive being crushed and buried.


Fire Spirits
Fire spirits manifest as wild fires, nearby vegetation or wooden surfaces breaking into
flames. Once a fire has started, it often spreads beyond the control of the spirit that
started it. Fire spirits are rarely used offensively. Not only are the flames likely to engulf
the shaman too but will also create devastation to the environment, which will take
generations to recover.

POW            Extent                    Manifestation
1D6+6          1m diameter               As per Flame on the 'Fire and Heat' table in the
                                    Legend Core Rulebook.
1D6+12         10m diameter              As above but a Large Flame.
1D6+18         100m diameter             As above but a Small Fire.
1D6+24         1 km diameter             As above but a Large Fire.
1D6+30         10 km diameter            As above but an Inferno.


Water Spirits
Water spirits can cause flooding or create whirlpools big enough to drag ships under
the surface.

POW           Extent               Manifestation
1D6+6         1m diameter          Mild current that prevents swimmers making
                                headway unless they succeed in an unopposed
                                Swim roll.
1D6+12        10m diameter         A riptide or vicious eddy drags swimmers under
                                the surface unless they succeed in an unopposed
                                Brawn roll.
1D6+18        100m diameter        Whirlpools engulf swimmers and drowns them
                                unless they succeed in an unopposed Resilience roll.
1D6+24        1 km diameter        Tidal wave or river bore swamps and capsizes
                                boats unless rower or helmsman succeeds in an
                                unopposed Boating roll.
1D6+30        10 km diameter       Maelstrom that drags ships under unless the
                                captain or helmsman succeeds in an unopposed
                                Shiphandling roll.


Wind Spirits
Wind spirits bring changes in the weather and can modify wind strength and cloud cover.

POW           Extent                   Manifestation
1D6+6         1m diameter              Raise or lower local conditions by one step on
                                    the 'Wind Strength' and 'Cloud Cover' tables in
                                    the Legend Core Rulebook.
1D6+12        10m diameter             Raise or lower local conditions by two steps.
1D6+18        100m diameter            Raise or lower local conditions by three steps.
1D6+24        1 km diameter            Raise or lower local conditions by four steps.
1D6+30        10 km diameter           Raise or lower local conditions by five steps.

Shamanic Fetches are handled in a different way. Scandinavian shamans focus more upon
the ability to project their own souls as animals, rather than bonding with a powerful
spirit ally. Upon the spirit plane the shaman always appears in his fylgjur form.

*	 A shaman's fetch is their fylgjur (see Viking Creatures page 171). The fylgjur does not
have separate Characteristics but uses the shaman's own INT, POW and CHA since
the fetch is the shaman's own soul. They are not a separate entity and the shaman
gains no additional Magic Points for awakening their fetch.
*	 The shaman can fully control the powers of their fylgjur, such as sending it out of
their body as an incorporeal spirit or in its physical form. Manifesting or sending
forth their soul requires a successful test of the Shamanism skill and costs a single
Magic Point.
*	 Similar to normal fetches, the shaman can use his fylgjur senses to see spirits, souls
and magical auras, without needing to enter a trance.
*	 Unlike normal people, a shaman can manipulate his fetch to take on the aspect of
several different creatures. Each 20%the shaman possesses in the Shamanism skill
(rounding up) allows mastery of a new form. This costs a number of Improvement
Rolls (as set by the Games Master); and once chosen this new animal form cannot
be changed.
*	 Since the fylgjur is the shaman's soul, it cannot be in two places at once. Thus a
shaman who sends forth their fetch lays helpless and unprotected. 'His body lay
then as if sleeping or dead, but he was then a bird or animal, fish or snake, and travelled
in a moment to faraway lands on his errands or those of other men' – Ynglinga Saga

Shamanism is a very powerful art, almost without peer in the Viking world. Shamans
are therefore treated with wary respect and the migratory Lapps left well alone for fear
of the supernatural reprisals they can extract.

Shaman sometimes trade one-use fetishes for things needed by their tribe. These bound
spirits count against the shaman's personal spirit limit until they are used, thus they
are rarely granted except to tribal members or trusted friends and allies. If used by a
non-shaman, the spirit performs a single service before returning to the spirit world.


Shamanism (Pow+Cha)
Shamanism is an Advanced skill used to control and communicate with the spirits. It
works precisely like a combined form of the Spirit Walking and Spirit Binding skills
found in the Legend Core Rulebook. Thus the skill can be used to:

*	   Enter a trance to observe or communicate with spirits.
*	   Send forth their fylgjur to the spirit world.
*	   Manifest their fylgjur as a physical creature.
*	   Engage in spirit combat to bind or convince spirits into fetishes.

Unlike Spirit Walking, Shamanism requires a preparatory trance lasting a number of
hours equal to their species maximum POW minus their Characteristic POW to enter
or observe the spirit world, or manifest their fylgjur. Magic Point costs remain the same.


Shape-shifting Magic
'A spell had been cast upon them, for which reason wolves' hides hung in the house overt
them... Sigmundr and Sinfjotli put on the hides and were not able to come out of them, and
the same power followed as before, and they also howled like wolves.'

- Volsunga Saga


Shape-shifting differs from an animalistic spirit sending, in that spirit forms are
usually the fylgjur of a shaman, whereas a shape-shifter is the physical body of the
user magically transformed into the animal itself. Shape-shifting requires the use of
an animal skin to assume a new form. For this reason shape-shifters are known as
hamrammr or skin-changers.

There are many shape shifting stories in the eddas and sagas, the gods themselves
frequently transform their shapes to travel swiftly or hide their nature, using hawk skins
or even the 'hide of a fly' for one of Loki's more amazing alterations. Fafnir's change
into a dragon is another example of shape-shifting as is that of Bjorn, the father of
Bodvar Bjarki, whose transformations were effected by means of a bear skin.

This form of shape-shifting has both advantages and disadvantages. On the beneficial
side the shape-shifter can change form in mere moments, much faster than the fylgjur
of a shaman, and does not leave a vulnerable, unconscious body behind. On the down
side, mortal shape-shifters lose their sapience, retaining only a base animalistic cunning
or drive and lose their ability to shift if lacking the skin of the beast to which they turn.

The best known shape-shifters are the warriors known as berserkr (bear-shirt)
and ulfhedinn (wolf-coat), whom use their animal-skin to induce their terrifying
berserkergang. Such is the strength of their transformation that they are reputedly
immune to fire and iron, although not to the teeth or talons of another shape-shifter.


Shape-shifting (Pow+Con)
Shape-shifting is an Advanced skill used to transform into the shape of a specific
animal. This can be any type of natural creature native to the user's homeland and can
include birds of prey or even whales!

Each incidence of the Shape-shifting skill relates to a specific creature. Thus to be able
to shift into three different animals would require learning this skill three times, once
for each creature.

To change into the animal form the user must possess the correct animal skin, spend a
Combat Action and make a successful Skill Test.

*	   A critical success only costs a single Magic Point.
*	   A normal success costs the normal number of Magic Points.
*	   A failure also costs the normal number of Magic Points but the transformation fails.
*	   A fumble costs all of the user's remaining Magic Points and they cannot attempt to
  shape-shift again for a day and a night.

The cost of shape-shifting is proportional to the bulk of the form being assumed; 1
Magic Point per 3 SIZ of the creature. It costs an Adventurer nothing to return to their
original form.

Since the animal shape is consistent with each transformation, an Adventurer that
learns this skill should roll the STR, CON, SIZ and DEX of their animal form. If the
SIZ of the beast is too large for them to transform, the Adventurer should re-roll that
Characteristic or select a more reasonably sized animal.

During a successful transformation the Adventurer uses the physical Characteristics
of his animal form but retains their own POW and CHA (where applicable). INT
is reduced to 7, allowing the shape-shifter some cunning and an ability to recognise
friend from foe.

Shape-shifters are immune to mundane harm but can be hurt by magic, ensorcelled
weapons or the natural weapons of other shape-shifters. If the user suffers such damage
as would be fatal if they transform back – a minor or serious wound as an animal,
which would be a major wound as a human for example – then they are trapped in
their animal form until they heal. This is dangerous however. Each day beyond the first
a shape-shifter remains an animal, they must roll an unopposed Persistence test. Failure
means that the shape-shifter loses their mind and will remain an animal.


Wondrous Items
In Scandinavian mythology, there are many wondrous items crafted by the gods and
giants. By far the most skilled of all artificers however are the dwarfs. They forge the
mightiest of weapons, the most beautiful of jewels and the cleverest of devices. Whist
their skill is without peer, placing their secrets beyond the grasp of Adventurers, their
items may easily fall into the hands of heroes... more often or not fated to die due to
the marvellous creation that has fallen within their grasp.

A few of the most famous artefacts are listed here, to give Games Masters the
opportunity to make such devices available in their campaigns, or perhaps be inspired
to produce their own versions.

Most of these enchanted weapons are very resilient to breaking; generally ignoring
damage that does not come from another ensorcelled weapon or some mighty
mythological creature, such as the corrosive blood of a troll or fire of a dragon.

Andvarinaut
The 'Andvari Gem' is a cursed ring that brings misfortune to all who hold it. Originally
part of a treasure horde stolen from the dwarf Andvari by Loki as part of a weregild to
pay for the accidental death of Ottar, the ring was given to Hreidmar, who was then
killed by his son Fafnir out of greed. Fafnir shape-shifted into a dragon to protect the
treasure but in turn was slain by Sigurd and the ring continued on a path of misery
causing the death of whomever owned it.

Gazing upon Andvarinaut forces the observer to immediately make an opposed test of
their Persistence against the ring's Instil Murderous Greed skill of 100%. Failure forces
the victim to obtain the ring by any means necessary.

Magical Weapon Traits
A number of the following weapons have unusual powers or abilities not currently
covered in the Legend rules. A number of new 'magical' traits have been added to
represent the mythical abilities these weapons had in the sagas.

Creature Bane: The weapon was forged to kill a specific type of creature. Inflicting
a wound on that species or race forces the injured creature to make an immediate
opposed test of their Persistence against the attack roll. Failure results in immediate
death.

Cunning Stroke: The weapon instinctively sneaks past the defences of an opponent.
On a successful attack the weapon gains two free levels of the Combat Manoeuvre
Bypass Parry. Thus it would reduce the size rating of a Viking Shield from Large to
Small or a Viking Sword from Medium to none.

Enduring Wounds: Injuries inflicted by the weapon cannot heal naturally. The damage
and any inability caused receiving it (such as unconsciousness or limb incapacitation)
persists until the wounds are treated magically.

Faithful: The weapon will return to its rightful owner by whatever twisted fate necessary.
Ownership can only be transferred if the current owner is defeated honourably and the
sword claimed as spoils, or if he voluntarily passes it on.

Fights of Itself: The weapon can fight by itself, dancing in the air to inflict wounds on
its owner's enemies. Although not wielded directly by its bearer, it has the same number
of Combat Actions and uses his weapon skill to attack and defend. If the bearer is
rendered unconscious or dead, the sword ceases to fight.

Keen Edged: A bladed weapon gifted with this trait can cut through armour or
weapons with no apparent effort. It automatically cuts straight through any protection
as if using the Bypass Armour Combat Manoeuvre. If the wielder uses the weapon to
Sunder armour or weapons, then the blade also ignores the Armour Points of inanimate
objects.

Never Misses: The weapon almost always hits its target, so that a failed attack roll is
treated as a normal success instead, as if under the effect of the Divine Magic spell
Sureshot (see page 125 of the Legend Core Rulebook)

Returning: If thrown or shot, the weapon returns to the hand or quiver of the user,
ready to be used on his next turn.


Ægishjalmarr
The 'Helm of Awe' is the helmet of Odin, which inspires terror in his foes. All who
gaze upon it must make a single opposed test of their Persistence against the Influence
of the wearer. Failure results in suffering the effect of Battle Fetter for the remainder of
their wearer's presence.

Brisingamen
The Brisingamen is the beautiful jewelled necklace of the goddess Freyja, who slept
with each of its four dwarf creators (the Brisings) in payment for it. Disgusted by her
acts Odin ordered Loki to steal the necklace and chastised Freyja for her infidelity,
offering only to return it if she caused a war between two great kings.

Anyone wearing Brisingamen gains a +100% bonus to their Influence and Seduction
skills.

Dainsleif
'Dain's Heirloom' is a blood thirsty sword that belonged to King Hogni. It is cursed so
that each time the blade is drawn it kills a man. In combat it twists through defences
and wounds made by it never heal naturally.

             Damage STR/           Combat        Magical      AP/

'Thou hast made this offer over-late, if thou wouldst make peace: for now I have drawn
Dainsleif, which the dwarves made, and which must cause a man's death every time it is
bared, nor ever fails in its stroke; moreover the wound heals not if one be scratched with it'

Draupnir
'The Dripper' is the golden arm-ring of Odin, which produces eight new gold rings of
equal weight on every ninth night.

Freyja's Feathered Cloak
A marvellous cloak of feathers belonging to Freyja, anyone donning the garment is
instantly transformed into a falcon, able to fly great distances at speed.

The cloak grants the wearer the following skill: Shape-shifting (Falcon) 100%.


Hringhorni
Balder's mighty ship, the largest ever made, in which he and his wife Nanna were
cremated after it was pushed out into the waves by the giantess Hyrrokkin.

The magic of Hringhorni is that it can carry an entire army or tribe with sufficient
space for everyone aboard.

Gambanteinn
'Rod of Revenge' the dwarf forged sword of Freyr, which fights by itself and is fatal
against the race of giants. The weapon was foolishly traded by Freyr to the female
Jotun Gerdr as a sign of his love. Although his marriage made him happy, Freyr was
eventually killed by the fire giant Surtr with his own blade.

Gjall
'Ringing Horn' is the horn, which Heimdall blows to announce portentous events. It
is sounded each time the one of the gods crosses Bifrost to arrive in Asgard and winded
more urgently when danger threatens. At the eve of Ragnarok Heimdall will sound to
horn so loudly that all the nine worlds shall hear its tone. Heimdall normally conceals
Gjall under the third root of Yggdrasil to prevent it being stolen by the giants, thus
enabling them to attack Asgard without warning.

Gleipnir
'Open One' was the third of a series of magical chains used to bind Fenris. The first
called Loding and the second named Dromi failed to restrain the monstrous wolf. The
dwarfs forged Gleipnir from the sound of a cat's footfall, the beard of a woman, the
roots of a mountain, the sinews of a bear, the breath of a fish and the spittle of a bird.
The resulting binding was as thin as a ribbon but impossible to break.

Golden Hair of Sif
After Loki cut Sif 's hair as a trick, the dwarf sons of Ivaldi forged new hair from strands
of fine gold, which when attached to her head grew like real hair. Although lacking any
significant power, the hair grants its wearer a CHA of 25.

Gram
'Wrath' was the sword of Sigmund, a gift from Odin who thrust it into the tree
Barnstokk from which Sigmund drew it. Odin later shattered the blade to cause
Sigmund's downfall and the fragments were later re-forged for his son Sigurd, by the
dwarf Regin. To prove its worth, the blade cleaved through the anvil upon which it was
forged and was used to slay the dragon Fafnir.

Gullinbursti
'Golden Bristles' is Freyr's magical boar made by the sons of Ivaldi. It is a deadly
opponent in battle.

'Sindri laid a pigskin in the hearth and bade Brokkr blow, and did not cease work until he
took out of the hearth that which he had laid therein. But when he went out of the smithy,
while the other dwarf was blowing, straightway a fly settled upon his hand and stung: yet he
blew on as before, until the smith took the work out of the hearth; and it was a boar, with
mane and bristles of gold. ... Then Brokkr brought forward his gifts: ... to Freyr he gave the
boar, saying that it could run through air and water better than any horse, and it could
never become so dark with night or gloom of the Murky Regions that there should not be
sufficient light where he went, such was the glow from its mane and bristles'

Gungnir
'Swaying One' is the dwarf fashioned spear of Odin. Its rune carved tip is enchanted so
that it never misses its mark, no matter how far away that target may be.

Hlidskjalf
The high seat of Odin set up in his hall Valaskjalf. Whomever sits in Hlidskjalf can see
into all the nine worlds and nothing is hidden from their gaze no matter what shape
or magic they use to hide.

The high seat provides Second Sight (as per the galdr) and adds 100% to the viewer's
Perception skill.

Jarngreipr
The iron gauntlets of Thor, which allow him to throw the hammer Mjollnir at his
enemies and permit him to catch or hold glowing-hot iron – as when Geirrod threw a
lump at Thor and he threw it back so hard it passed through an iron pillar and lodged
into the giant's body, killing him instantly. The magical gloves and following belt were
gifts from the friendly giantess, Grid.

The iron gauntlets protect the wearer from any heat or fire damage.

Megingjord
Thor's 'Girdle of Might' that make him incredibly strong. It was the blessing of his belt
that allowed him to drag up the Midgard Serpent during a fishing trip.

The magical belt doubles the user's normal strength. However, if the wearer takes time
to muster their full might they can magnify their strength for a single action. Each
round of delay further increments this bonus. Thus one round will triple the wearer's
strength; two rounds quadruple it and so on.

Mistilteinn
The sword 'Mistletoe' is a famous man killer. In the hands of King Thrainn it slew 420
men and was buried with its lord after his death. It was recovered by a hero named
Hromundr who entered the barrow and defeated the king who had risen as a draugr. The
sword was later lost at sea due to witchcraft but found again in the belly of a pike fish.

that it would not find its way back, and when he wanted, it would be so small that it could
be carried inside his tunic.'


Naglfar
The 'Nail Ship' is the vessel constructed by the giant Naglfari to carry the giants to the
final battle at Ragnarok. It is made out of the nails of the deceased, which has led to the
tradition of trimming the fingernails of the deceased, to delay the eventual completion
of Nagelfar.

Shoes of Light Steps
Worn by Loki, these shoes allow him to run over water or through the air as if it were
solid ground.

Skidbladnir
'Covered with Pieces of Wood' is Freyr's magic ship. Constructed by the sons of the
dwarf Ivaldi, the ship is capable of sailing across the seas and the skies, its sail always
filling with a fair wind. It is large enough to hold all the Æsir and their horses but is
collapsible and can be folded up to fit in a pocket!

Skofnung
'Gnawer' is the sword of King Hrolf Kraki, which imbued with supernatural hardness
and sharpness, rings loudly whenever it bites bone (inflicts a Serious or Major Wound).
In addition the injuries it gives cannot be healed until rubbed with the stone that
accompanies it. The sword had two wyrds. Firstly it should not be drawn in the
presence of women and secondly the sun must never shine on its hilt. Failing either
will cause the blade to turn on its wielder.

'That's when King Hrolf rushes at him and hacked off both his buttocks, right down to the

Suttungmjadar
The mead of poetry was fermented from the blood of wise Kvasir, who was murdered
by two dwarfs and his ichor mixed with honey. This magical mead was so potent the
dwarves exchanged it for their lives to escape being slain by the giant Suttung. Odin
later stole the mead from the giant and now guards it in Asgard, containing the three
cauldrons named Odroerir, Bodn and Son. Drinking the magical mead blesses the
imbiber great knowledge. It is said that Odin grants sips of this mead to skalds skilled
in poetry.

Drinking a sip of Suttungmjadar either raises one of the imbiber's Lore skills or their
Poetry skill to 100%.


Tyrfing
'Battle Fang' is an infamous blade that never misses a stroke, can cut through stone and
iron and suffers no damage. Forged under duress by the dwarfs Dvalin and Durin, they
cursed the blade so that it would kill a man every time it was drawn, perform three
great evils and slay King Svafrlami who had forced them to make the sword.

Vidar's Invulnerable Shoes
The thick soled shoes of Vidar are formed from all the cast-off leather scraps that
mortals trim from their own shoes. Invulnerable to damage they will enable Vidar to
plant one foot on the lower jaw of Fenris enabling him to tear the monstrous wolf 's
mouth apart, thus finally killing him.

The shoes are stronger than iron and have an infinite number of Armour Points
protecting the legs of the wearer.


Minor Magical Items
Many minor magical items can be created using the Rune Carving skill. A few of the
following examples are items mentioned in the sagas, with suggested Galdrastafir to
give them their potency.

*	 Fire Proof Tunic – A tunic ensorcelled with Quench Flame.
*	 Gloves of Healing Touch – Gloves enchanted with Heal Wound which affect what
is touched, rather than who is wearing them.
*	 Helm of Beserkergang – A helmet engraved with the Ease Pain runes.
*	 Iron Proof Shirt – A reindeer-skin shirt enchanted with Ward Injury, known as
gorningstakkr in the sagas.
*	 Legendary Weapon – A sword, axe or spear ensorcelled with Grant Victory or
Grow Strong.
*	 Raven War Banner – A banner woven with many Battle Fetter runes.
*	 Shield of Warding – A shield graved with Deflect Arrow or Blunt Weapon.
*	 Wand of Dispelling – A stick or staff carved with a single use of Break Charm,
which can be recharged with an appropriate investment of Magic Points.

These items could be heirlooms still in existence long after their creators have died. To
determine the Magnitude of their effect, roll on the table on page 170.

Raven Banners

'...the war-banner which they called “Raven”. It is said that three sisters of Hungar and
Habba, the daughters of Lodbrokr, had woven that banner and completely prepared it
during one single midday's time. It also is said that in any battle where the signum was
borne before them, if they were to obtain the victory one would see in the middle of the
signum a living raven flying; but if they were about to be defeated, it hung straight without
movement: and this always proved to be true.'

The Raven Banners were prophetic battle standards, which warriors believed in
implicitly. Used by the Danes against the Anglo-Saxons, they infused the Vikings with
the faith of Odin gazing down on them, ready to pluck up the bravest to be borne back
to Valhalla. The Saxons on the other hand, thoroughly converted to Christianity saw
the banners as pagan idols to be greatly feared.

It was the reputation of the banner's infallible prophecies of victory, which perhaps won
more battles for the Danes than their force of arms. The psychological warfare working
precisely like Odin's magical curse of battle fetter on everyone in the enemy army!


Viking Creatures
'We return now to tell of Gest. Towards midnight he heard a loud noise outside, and very
soon there walked a huge troll-wife into the room. She carried a trough in one hand and
a rather large cutlass in the other. She looked round the room as she entered, and on seeing
Gest lying there she rushed at him; he started up and attacked her furiously.

They fought long together; she was the stronger but he evaded her skilfully. Everything near
them and the panelling of the back wall were broken to pieces. She dragged him through
the hall door out to the porch, where he resisted vigorously. She wanted to drag him out of
the house, but before that was done they had broken up all the fittings of the outer door and
borne them away on their shoulders. Then she strove to get to the river and among the rocks.

Gest was terribly fatigued, but there was no choice but either to brace himself or be dragged
down to the rocks. All night long they struggled together, and he thought he had never met
with such a monster for strength. She gripped him so tightly to herself that he could do
nothing with either hand but cling to her waist.

When at last they reached a rock by the river he swung the monster round and got his right
hand loose. Then he quickly seized the short sword which he was wearing, drew it and
struck at the troll's right shoulder, cutting off her right arm and releasing himself. She sprang
among the rocks and disappeared in the waterfall. Gest, very stiff and tired, lay long by the
rock. At daylight he went home and lay down on his bed, blue and swollen all over.'

- Grettirs Saga

Mighty creatures and terrible monsters are a staple part of Viking tales. A highly
superstitious people, the Vikings fear the unknown; dreading the spirits of the deep
forests, of rivers and lakes and, of course, the dead. When a wild animal acts unusually
it could be misinterpreted as being a shamanic fetch or a malicious shape-shifter.

Some awesome beings such as dragons exist in the eddas, together with colossal
creatures birthed by the jotnar. Yet most are either humanoid or animal in form. The
range of the truly fantastic is somewhat limited as the Scandinavians did not appear to
have much imagination when compared to the chimerical wonders of other cultures.


This chapter is broken into three sections for ease of use.

*	 Animals: Characteristics of normal animals that can be freely encountered in
historical or 'real world' campaigns.
*	 Supernatural Creatures: Fantastic beings that haunt the world, believed by all to
exist but normally only met in fantasy campaigns.
*	 Unique Monsters: The legendary one-of-a-kind fiends that should only be faced in
mythological campaigns where players are divine or semi-divine themselves.

Most of the following creatures should be used sparingly. Violent beasts do not regularly
appear in waves to be slaughtered every Odinsday. Such occurrences are rare events.
Bears generally avoid men, for example, but hunting down a dangerous wounded bear
can make a memorable adventure.

Likewise, the draugr and vættir normally lie quiet in their graves and forests unless stirred
to anger, usually from human meddling. As such they are rarely encountered. Meetings
with these sorts of creatures should be very special events, both to enhance the scenario and
to keep them mysterious and frightening. In fact if playing a purist historical campaign
Adventurers will never be able to encounter such beings, merely the un-provable rumours
of their malevolent involvement and recounts of terrified eye witness.

Mythological campaigns of course are a different matter. Being of Æsir or Vanir blood,
Adventurers will be rubbing shoulders with giants on a regular basis or going off on
monster hunts, which seems a popular pastime of the Norse gods.


Animals
Living in the bleak northern realms of Europe, the number and diversity of dangerous
animals available to challenge Viking Adventurers is rather limited. The natural
elements or men themselves are the most common foe in their sagas.

A few northern animals are described here, either due to the possibility of the creature:
*	 Attacking Adventurers out of hunger or anger.
*	 Being hunted for food or sport.
*	 Being used in animal fights for entertainment.

Smaller Scandinavian animals are not detailed since they pose no real threat to a
hunter. These include Beavers, Ermine, Foxes, Hares, Lynx, Martins, Mink, Otters
and Wolverine, most of which are hunted for their fur pelts – a valuable commodity for
northern regions. Seals are also hunted, both for their skins and their meat.

The following Characteristics and skills are simply average values for a member of
that species. Games Masters are free to create individual animals by rolling their
Characteristics, or choosing a value within the Characteristic range. Older or more
cunning animals may have better skills to reflect their experience. All of the animals
described here use the Monster Coliseum convention of doubling Fixed INT to
determine their number of Combat Actions and Strike Rank.

Fighting Quadrupeds
As a rule when four legged animals fight, the creature places its head towards its
opponent. Given the size of most quadrupeds, it is difficult for a single human
opponent to strike any location other than the forequarters, front legs or head of the
beast. For this reason, it is suggested that when an Adventurer attacks such an animal,
they roll 1D10+10 for the Hit Location. Of course, if the animal is surrounded by
multiple foes, then the full range of its target locations should be available.




Aurochs
Huge forest cattle standing nearly two metres at the shoulder and weighing over a
metric ton, aurochs are a giant Pleistocene species still common across Scandinavia but
become rare by the end of the Viking Age. They are famed for their strength, which is
why the Second Rune in the futhark is named after them. Hunting aurochs is a near
suicidal pastime but very rewarding in terms of the quantity of meat provided.

Combat Notes
Aurochs prefer to fight by charging threats with their gore attack. If the target is
knocked prone and continues to move, the aurochs will trample until the victim stops
responding. A successful charge increases the Damage Bonus to 2D10. If lamed an
aurochs continues to fight in place until it collapses from exhaustion.

Aurochs' horns are capable of both Sundering and Impaling and, if a foe is Impaled,
the next Combat Action sees the bull aim to throw its victim with a toss of its head. If
the impaled victim is conscious, he may pit either his Athletics or Acrobatics against the
Brawn of the bull. If successful, he may land safely on his feet or all fours. If unsuccessful,
or if unconscious, the victim suffers the equivalent to a five metre fall and lands prone.


Bear
Scandinavian bears generally leave men alone, giving settlements a wide berth. However,
in early spring they awaken ravenous and are therefore dangerously unpredictable.
Wounded bears often threaten humans (or their livestock) due to pain and desperate
hunger. Killing a bear singlehandedly is a deed of renown; the few men who manage it
wear the skin with pride.

A bear can be very fast over short distances, easily capable of running down a man but
unable to maintain speed for long. Bears are also excellent climbers and can swim well.

Combat Notes
Bears rely on their fearsome claws first and foremost. Claws are capable of Sundering
and a bear will try to rip through armour, or bypass it, to inflict the most damage. The
claws are also used to Grip, thus allowing the creature to pull the opponent close for a
bite – which can also sunder.


Bear, Polar
The largest and most aggressive species of bear known to the Vikings, polar bears
live on the frozen arctic ice flows and coastline of northern Scandinavia, Russia and
Greenland. It is a strictly carnivorous creature, dining primarily on seals and fish. They
are sometimes hunted for their skins, which are very valuable.

Polar bears are excellent swimmers. They have little fear of humans and will often treat
them as prey if they come into the bears' territory.

Boar
Boars are wild, feral pigs with wiry coats, long tusks and extremely poor dispositions.
They generally live in forested areas, foraging on nuts, roots, berries and fungi. Male
boars are solitary for most of the year but will join herds during mating season. A herd
or sounder is normally comprised of two or three breeding females and their litters of
immature young, numbering up to 20 members. Both boars and sows will fight to
protect their young, the tusk-lacking females biting instead.

Boars are ferociously territorial creatures that will attack a much larger creature without
hesitation. They are also incredibly resilient to damage and do not need to make
Resilience rolls against any wounds save Major Wounds.

Eagle
Eagles are the largest predatory birds in Scandinavia and prey upon creatures up to the
size of full grown reindeer. A number of species are covered by these Characteristics,
including White Tailed Eagles and Golden Eagles. They can also be used for large
Ravens and Owls, the later possessing the Night Sight trait.

Combat Notes
Large birds of prey make their initial attack by diving out of the sky. Eagles gain a
tremendous amount of speed when plunging from great height, increasing their
Damage Bonus by two steps. Owls and Ravens do not usually dive such great distances
and only increase Damage Bonus by a single step. Such aerial attacks normally strike
without warning, allowing the bird to opt for the Choose Location manoeuvre,
generally targeting the hindquarters of quadrupeds or the neck (head) of bipeds, using
their strong talons to break the spine. Ravens lack the strength of eagle claws but have
a more fearsome beak and thus swap the base damage values.

Predatory birds can sometimes be trained to attack targets that are not their normal
prey. In such circumstances, they are often taught to Bash human opponents to try
and knock them prone, or strike for the eyes in order to blind and cause pain and
distraction. Diving attacks are considered charges, often forcing a target without a
shield to rely on Evade to avoid being pecked or scratched.


Elk
One of the most common food sources for Scandinavian hunters, as well as a number
of large carnivores, elk are a wary but dangerous species. Standing over two metres tall
at the shoulder, a full grown elk generally only weighs half of what an average aurochs
does. They dwell mostly in the depths of forests and swamps feeding on ground
vegetation and small branches. Normally peaceful creatures they avoid contact with
humans, moving with remarkable stealth.

The natural predators of elk are normally wolf packs or bears, from which they will
run. If cornered they will turn and attack hunters, their hoofs as well as the impressive
antlers of bull stags proving to be deadly.

Combat Notes
Elk normally use Bash or Stun Location to incapacitate foes, allowing them to flee from
danger. They rarely try to kill, most deaths happening accidentally due the animal's size
and strength.


Horse
Scandinavian horses are small and shaggy versions of their European cousins. Vikings
primarily use horses for transport, as pack animals, hitched to draw sleds or riding
them. Whilst not as big as normal horses, they are very tough, bred to survive poor
grazing and harsh winters.

Horses are never ridden in battle, Vikings preferring to fight afoot due to the difficulty
of combat from horseback.

Scandinavians enjoyed watching and gambling on animal fights. Horse fights were very
popular, pitting stallions against each other in the presence of a mare in heat. Those that
would not fight were goaded with horse-crooks. The Sagas often describe such contests
developing into brawls between the horses'owners, over disputed results and lost bets.

Hound
Scandinavian dogs come in two main breeds. Elghunds are trained for hunting
large game such as elk or bears, whereas Buhunds are bred as herding dogs. Both are
descended from wolves, cross-breed for size and strength to perform their jobs and
survive winter weather conditions. The hearing and sense of smell of these dogs is
acute, reflected in the Perception and Track rating.

Combat Notes
These hunting and warding dogs are not trained to physically attack, rather they
are supposed to hold quarry at bay and alert their master. If a dog is forced to enter
combat, once it connects with its bite, it Grips the opponent acting as a –10% penalty
to the target until forced to let go. Every Combat Action thereafter the dog may savage
the location, inflicting damage without suffering any effect from possessing a negative
damage modifier as it pulls and rends.


Reindeer
The most common species of deer in northern Scandinavia, reindeer are the jealously
guarded animals of the Lapps, who base their nomadic lifestyle around seasonal reindeer
migrations. Although noted for their impressive antlers, which grow on both sexes,
hunting reindeer is normally dangerous due to the retribution of their Lapp guardians,
rather than the deer themselves. The animals are sometimes semi-domesticated, often
being used to draw sleds in the winter.

Combat Notes
Reindeer prefer to flee from danger, unless overwhelmed by hunger. Bull reindeer
become aggressive during rut and cow reindeer will fight to protect calves. The antlers
are capable of causing an Impale.


Shark
There are few dangerous sharks in Scandinavian waters, so attacks are normally a rare
occurrence. One species, the Greenland shark, can reach up to seven metres in length.
If brought to the surface caught in nets or attracted by the blood of a sea battle, it could
be very dangerous to anyone falling into the water.

All sharks rely on their bite. Once a bite connects, the shark Grips. On the next Combat
Action, the shark spins and rends; the Swim skill of the victim is reduced by half as the
shark bites deeper, rips and attempts to drown its prey.


Snake
Snakes are a common motif in Scandinavian art and legend, being closely associated
with dragons. When Loki was punished for his evil deeds, he was bound between three
rocks, with a serpent dripping venom onto his face.

When shipwrecked on the coast of Northumbria, the famous Viking Ragnar Hairy-
Breeks was captured by King Ælla and sentenced to be thrown into a pit of venomous
snakes. Whilst being slowly bitten to death he legendarily sung the following song.

'It gladdens me to know that Baldr's father makes ready the benches for a banquet.
Soon we shall be drinking ale from the curved horns.
The champion who comes into Odin's dwelling does not lament his death.
I shall not enter his hall with words of fear upon my lips.
The Æsir will welcome me. Death comes without lamenting… Eager am I to depart.
The Dísir summon me home, those whom Odin sends for me from the halls of the Lord of
Hosts.
Gladly shall I drink ale in the high-seat with the Æsir.
The days of my life are ended. I laugh as I die.'

Despite their prevalence in the eddas, the only Scandinavian snake that is dangerous
to man is the Adder. It can grow up to a metre in length and generally avoids contact,
only biting if surprised or injured. An adder's bite is superficial unless it injects venom,
which is rarely fatal but painful and can cause unpleasant sickness.

Combat Notes
Adders usually try to escape after they have bitten and do not engage in ongoing
combat unless left with no choice – being tied inside a sack with a victim for example.
Adder venom has the following Characteristics:

Application: Injection
Onset time: Pain immediately, nausea and vomiting after 30 minutes, loss of bowel
and bladder control after 1 hour.
Duration: 1D2 days
Resistance Time: The victim must make a single Resistance roll when first bitten.
Failure indicates that the series of conditions will take effect at the proper onset time.
Potency: Snake's CON x 5
Resistance: Resilience
Conditions: Pain, Nausea, Diahorrea and Incontinence. The venom initially causes
location bitten to be afire with pain, which gradually spreads into neighbouring
regions. The victim then begins to throw up from nausea. The third condition has no
in-game effect save that of embarrassment.
Antidote/Cure: A successful Healing roll will allow the victim to make a new Resistance
Roll as per the Healing skill in the Legend Core Rulebook. Success prevents any further
Conditions from taking effect.


Walrus
Huge seal-like mammals with prominent tusks and whiskers, a full grown male walrus
on average weighs one and a half metric tons. Despite its fearsome tusks the creature
actually feeds on shellfish and the occasional crustacean, using its extended canines for
mating fights and pulling itself onto ice out of the water.

Unfortunately for the walrus it is a significant source of usable ivory, meat, skin and
bone. Found in Greenland and the Svalbard Islands, it is possible for Vikings to go
hunting for walrus, either by stalking them in the summer whilst they bask on beaches
or during the winter, hunting them in boats.

Combat Notes
On land a walrus rears and plunges its tusks into an opponent, sometimes impaling.
However, the walrus is ungainly and cannot change engagement distance easily, so
attacking a walrus with longer reach weapons often maintains the hunter's safety but
normally results in the animal dragging itself into the sea and swimming away. Inuit
hunters use harpoons for this reason.

In the water a walrus becomes a very dangerous foe, using its large mass to ram boats,
sinking or capsizing them. Once a hunter is in the water, the walrus freely attacks;
ramming the swimmer to Stun them or using their tusks to Grip the victim and drag
them under. Either way the hunter normally drowns.


Whale
In Scandinavian waters can be found Minke whales, Humpback whales, Blue whales,
Sperm whales, Orcas and Pilot whales. Generally the Vikings leave the bigger whales
well alone, their ships being unable to withstand the irritation of a wounded leviathan.
Whale hunting is done in small boats with harpoons but is very dangerous.

An alternative is to trap a pod of whales in an inlet or bay with a narrow opening.
The Vikings then drive the whales ashore by chasing them in boats or firing poisoned
arrows at them. One tale tells of a chieftain named Ottar in northern Norway who
managed to kill 60 whales in two days with the help of five men.

Many whales eaten by Vikings are simply poor beasts, which become stranded on the
shore, often provoking disputes between landowners and opportunistic gatherers as to
who has the legal right to the meat, blubber and bone from the carcass.

The following Characteristics are for a small whale such as an Orca or Minke. Hunting,
or being hunted, by such an animal could be an epic adventure in itself.

Combat Notes
Orcas can potentially attack humans who are travelling across ice flows, using their
bulk to overturn or break ice sheets. They can also grab targets standing at the water's
edge on a moderately shelved beach, surging out of the water to bite, before rolling
back into the waves. Orcas have frighteningly enormous mouths. They swallow most
prey whole or sheer off mouth sized chunks with each bite. If bitten by an Orca, it
generally does not matter what Combat Manoeuvre it uses.

Minke whales are not normally aggressive but being stabbed with a harpoon may cause
the whale to turn on the boat, ramming it at speed or breaching next to the vessel to
swamp it with water. Survivors of an overturned or sinking boat are left to drown.


Wolf
Wolves fight as a group. In combat, several of them target a single enemy, raising the
chances that one of them will be able to get through any defence. Larger wolves of the
pack will often attempt to throw an enemy off his feet with a Leaping Attack, allowing
the remainder of the pack to rush in while the enemy is off balance.

Though wolves are hated by herders and farmers for their tendency to dine on
livestock, they rarely attack humans. Some wolves could be driven by age or cunning
to become opportunistic man-killers, giving rise to superstitious fears of the wolf being
the offspring of Fenrir or the curse of a Lapp wizard.

Supernatual Creatures
Viking belief of the supernatural coalesced into many strange creatures, some unique
to Scandinavia, whilst others appear to be memories or legends, which travelled from
other lands. What emerged from the fireside tales of dark winter nights formed the
basis for much of Europe's mythological beings. It is from the Vikings we gained the
elfs and dwarfs, the physical revenants and such oddities as the kraken.

Unfortunately the eddas and sagas actually mention very few diverse supernatural
creatures. What does exist in Viking folklore is a complex mishmash of confusing
and conflicting names that makes it difficult to identify what a creature really is. For
simplicity's sake, the following creatures have been gathered together under broad
categories, with a list of their more common names.

*	 Alfar – Confusingly the title is used for the races of elfs and dwarfs. Ljosalfar are
considered elfs of air and light, whereas Svartalfar are inferred to be dwarfs living
below the earth. A third branch are the Dokkalfar who reside within Midgard in
the hills and mounds.
*	 Dísir – A collective name for female spirits concerned with fate and fortune,
specifically the Fylgja, Norns and Valkyries.
*	 Draugr – The restless and hungry dead, including Haugbui and Aptrgangr.
*	 Dvergar – These are generally thought of as the dwarfs, although some are named
as, or after, elfs! The dvergar Gandalfr (Magic Elf ) and Vindalfr (Wind Elf ) for
example.
*	 Jotnar – Several races of giants exist; frost and rime giants (hrimthursar), fire
giants (eldjotnar) and mountain giants (bergrisar).
*	 Vættir – Are the nature spirits or supernatural beings. Technically they include
the Alfar, Dvergar, Jotnar, Æsir and Vanir each of which are considered specific
families of Vættir but for the purposes of this book the Landvættir specifically are
just spirits.

Supernatural creatures will not, of course, be encountered in historical or 'real world'
campaigns, save for superstitious reference. They can appear in fantasy or mythological
campaigns, where such beings freely exist.

Some of the powers and abilities described for these creatures are rather tenuous and
lack specific game mechanics. This is intentional, to allow a Games Master a great deal
of latitude in what such a supernatural being can do. The superstitious Vikings are
often at a loss as to how to deal with such things, often seeking sorcerers to counter
their powers with magic, or heroes to overcome more physical beasts with prowess.
Such choices often fail, leaving a victim cursed or damned – a wyrd that could be
passed onto successive generations. The moral of these tales is not to upset the spirits
of the world in the first place, or make amends if you do!


Alfar
'The Allfather has power, the alfar have skill, and the vanir knowledge'

- The Hrafnagaldr

The Alfar are the light or good elves of Viking mythology. They live in Alfheimr
ruled by King Alf but occasionally roam Midgard where they sometimes sleep with
humankind. The results of these unions are half-elfs, gifted with the great beauty of
their elf ancestry and are oft-times skilled in Seidr.

Alfar are semi-divine, linked with nature and ancestor spirits. They can cast off their
physical aspects to pass though solid doors or walls. In addition they have powers of
fertility and are faithful followers of Freyr. According to the Vikings there are several
races of alfar, as recorded in the Prose Edda:

'There is one place there that is called Alfheimr. People live there that are named the light
elves (Ljosalfar). But the dark elves (Svartalfar) live below in earth, in caves and the dark
forest and they are unlike them in appearance – and more unlike them in reality. The Light
Elves are brighter than the sun in appearance, but the Dark Elves are blacker than pitch.'

Viking families often hold sacrifices to the alfar (alfablot), usually small offerings of
food. In return the elf will sometimes perform a helpful task around the farmstead.
Failing to sacrifice to them results in some malign misfortune, such as a barn burning
down or stored grain to go mouldy.

An Alfr can even heal battle wounds if granted a significant sacrifice.

'Thorvard healed but slowly; and when he could get on his feet he went to see Thordís, and
asked her what was best to help his healing. 'A hill there is,' answered she, 'not far away from
here, where elfs have their haunt. Now get you the bull that Kormak killed, and redden the
outer side of the hill with its blood, and make a feast for the elfs with its flesh. Then thou
wilt be healed.'

The following Characteristics are for alfar in their physical form. However if they
spend a Magic Point they can discorporate, their body becoming intangible.

                                      Magic: Alfar command spirits of the
                                      Landvættir and know some galdrar

As semi divine beings, alfar are effectively very skilful immortal creatures. In fantasy
campaigns they rarely interact directly with humans save in response to a sacrifice (or
lack of one) made to them. In such cases if the alfar is pleased it will heal someone
of a major wound, rebuild a destroyed or dilapidated barn, grant twin offspring to
livestock, harvest the crops and so on. An unhappy alfar will bring misfortune; souring
mead, cause food to rot or livestock to become sick for example. In each of these cases
the blessing or curse occurs overnight whilst witnesses are asleep. Their actual skills and
magic do not need to be defined.

In mythological campaigns, alfar can become servants or loyal companions to heroic
(or divine) Adventurers. Under these circumstances an alfar should be defined with
skills appropriate to its position and profession. A loyal servant for instance may be less
skilled in warfare but might be the equal of the Adventurers in social skills; whereas
Gandalfr, the last king of the alfar may have magical and combat skills far exceeding
those of the Adventurers.

Alfar are assumed to know the Shamanism skill with which they command the
Landvættir. It is this control of nature spirits and knowledge of the Evil Eye galdr,
which allows them to bless or curse their supplicants.


Disir
The dísir are female spirits that are tied to fate or fortune. Both the Norns and Valkyries are
disir but are mentioned separately in the Viking Religion chapter beginning on page 110.

Disir are usually bound to a particular clan or family. Servants of Freyja, they are
fertility or ancestor spirits, which have some power to intercede with nature. When
propitiated correctly the disir grant good luck. Such sacrificial ceremonies (disablot) are
held in the autumn by the women of the household; and at the onset of winter too, the
second with the family and guests attending.

New Trait: Ancestor Sense
The possessor of this trait can sense whenever a family descendant will face mortal
danger. The semi-precognitive power gives enough forewarning to allow the ancestor
to travel to the progeny and intervene if desired. It does not however, reveal the source
of the danger or what will happen.



As tutelary beings, the disir act as guardians defending their family against malicious
spirits or evil magic. They are jealous and judgemental guardians however. In one
saga two brothers are directed to kill their brother by a disir and in the Saga of Olaf
Tryggvason is the tale of Thidrandi, who is killed by nine disir because his family was
planning to convert to Christianity!

When physically manifested disir appear as tall, proud women dressed in black, riding
dark horses. They carry swords with which they can fight if necessary.

In fantasy campaigns a disir may make its presence known by shielding a pious sacrifice
against some form of supernatural threat, whether a Seidr casting sorcerer or a physical
monster. They may also whisper advice or guidance into the ear of a descendant. For
the purposes of such games assume that a disir is normally invisible but once corporeal
can only be harmed by magic or enchanted weapons.

Disir become somewhat redundant in Mythological campaigns where Adventurers
may not be mortal and thus not fall under their protection. An angry disir may make
excellent shield-maiden foe or companions however; perhaps even a possible wife to
those worthy enough.

Dragon
Save for the unique dragon in Beowulf, most dragons in Scandinavian legend are
actually wingless serpents of great size that vomit poison rather than flame. Such
creatures are described under Wyrm later in this chapter.


Draugr
'During the first night, Aran got up from his chair and killed the hawk and hound and
ate them. On the second night he got up again from his chair, and killed the horse and tore
it into pieces; then he took great bites at the horse-flesh with his teeth, the blood streaming
down from his mouth all the while he was eating. The third night Asmund became very
drowsy, and the first thing he knew, Aran had got him by the ears and torn them off '

- Asmund's vigil within the mound of his sword brother Aran, Gautrek's Saga

Viking undead were known by several names. The haugbui is a dead body, which
continues to guard its barrow from being plundered or desecrated. A draugr is an
animated corpse that roams far and wide inflicting fear amongst those living nearby.
Also known as an aptrgangr, an after-goer, these draugr are murderous creatures who
consume the living to satisfy an unappeasable craving for life. Some draugr are the
victims of drowning, returning from the seas as portents of doom.

All Scandinavian undead are corporal creatures lacking a soul. They are merely the
corpse left after death, driven on by revenge or injustice. There are no such things
as intangible ghosts or spectres in Viking superstition, although the body can move
magically through earth and stone to exit their barrows without needing to dig their
way clear. The draugr Killer-Hrapp uses this power to escape a combat in the Laxdaela
Saga:

'Then Olaf tried to rush Hrapp, but Hrapp sank into the ground where he had been
standing and that was the end of their encounter'.

Draugr come in two colours, the blue-black of mottled bruises (as the goddess of the
underworld) or the pale white of corpses. They can appear bloated or swollen to great
size, gaining in weight as well as proportions. The body of the draugr Thorolf in the
Eyrbyggja Saga grew so big and heavy it took levers to move him.

Of course with this growth comes an increase in strength and draugr often kill their
victims by breaking their necks or crushing every bone in their body in tremendous
bear hugs. Some draugr are invulnerable to iron until they are first defeated by hand-
to-hand grappling.

The draugr of sorcerers and shaman can retain some magical powers beyond death.
Notable examples are controlling the weather to prevent access to their barrows, whilst
others can shape-shift into a variety of forms; generally ones with horrible mutilations
such as flayed bulls or horses with no ears, tails and a broken back.


The Curse of the Walking Dead
In the Eyrbyggja Saga there is a tale about the village of Frodis-water, which soon after
a portentous omen of a rain of blood, was cursed with a terrible sickness and the first
to die arose as a draugr. As each person was killed by the touch of the creature, they
themselves rose up afterwards as a draugr too. The following passages describe the
aftermath of the death of the local shepherd...

'A little after that great hauntings befell; and on a night as Thorir Wooden-leg went out for
his needs, and turned off aside from the door, when he would go in again, he saw how the
shepherd was come before the door. Then would he go in again, but the shepherd would
nowise have it so; and Thorir was fain to get away, but the shepherd went at him, and
got hold of him, and cast him homeward up against the door. At this he was affrighted
exceedingly; yet he got him to his bed, and he was by then grown coal-blue all over.

Now from this he fell sick and died, and was buried there at the church; but ever after were
the twain, the shepherd and Thorir Wooden-leg, seen in company, and there from were folk
full of dread, as was like to be. After Thorir's death a house-carle of Thorod fell sick, and
lay there three nights or ever he died. Then one after another died, till six were dead; and
by then it was hard on the Yule-fast, though at that time there was no fasting in Iceland.'

This story provides the basis for a classic zombie scenario, with a remote village cut off
by winter slowly succumbing to the curse of the walking draugr!



'Then Thrain turned himself into a troll, and the barrow was filled with a horrible stench;
and he stuck his claws into the back of Hromund's neck, tearing the flesh from his bones'

Destroying a draugr is often an increadably difficult task achievable only by the strongest
heroes. If invulnerable to iron the creature must first be subdued in a wrestling match.
Once defeated, the draugr can be decapitated, normally using a named blade of noted
quality or magical craftsmanship. Sometimes the head will try to rejoin the body, so
it must be either physically blocked or stopped with some charm. Lastly the remains
must be burned to ashes, which are then cast into the sea or scattered by the winds.
Failure to complete every step means that the draugr will eventually raise again, no
doubt to hunt down those who tried to destroy it.

'But the next morning he let bring his horse, and called his huskarls to him, and gathered
men to him from the nearest steads withal; and then they fare out to Haltfoot's-head, and
come to Thorolf 's howe; and he was even yet unrotten, and as like to a fiend as like could
be, blue as hell, and big as a bull; and when they went about the raising of him, they could
in nowise stir him. So Thorod set lever-beams under him, and thereby they brought him up
from the howe, and rolled him down to the seaside, and cut there a great bale, and set fire to
it, and rolled Thorolf therein and burned all up to cold coals; yet long it was or ever the fire
would take on him. There was a stiff breeze, which scattered the ashes wide about as soon
as the bale began to burn; but such of the ashes as they might, they cast out seaward; and so
when they had made an end of the business they went home.'

When a man dies and becomes a draugr, their STR and SIZ often increase. Re-roll those
Characteristics and if higher, take the better result. The draugr loses their POW as they
no longer possess a soul. Draugr wishing to use magic must first drain the life of a living
creature to power the charm or summoning. CHA is re-rolled also but in this case the
lower value is kept. CON, DEX and INT remain as before.

The following draugr is of moderate strength and size. More powerful examples exist but
Games Masters should be careful to ensure grossly swollen draugr of huge proportions
are not invulnerable to weapons, else Adventurers will find it impossible to defeat them.

Combat Notes
Somewhat slow and seemingly uncaring of weapons, draugr prefer to engage in close
combat, using Grip to catch hold of their prey before crushing or strangling them. Due
to their near invulnerability, or perhaps seeking a permanent death, they concentrate
on attacking rather than defending, so that they never bother to defend themselves.


Grave Robbing
The presence of great wealth within the burial mounds of early Vikings attracted the
attention of grave-robbers, both historically and in the literary record, such as the tale
of Grettirs Saga.

'Grettir began to break open the mound, and worked hard without stopping until he reached
the rafters, late in the afternoon. Then he tore them up. Audun did his best to discourage
him from entering the mound. Grettir told him to watch the rope, 'for I am going to find
out what inhabits the barrow.' Then Grettir went inside the mound. Inside it was dark,
and the air not very sweet'

Grave-robbers had to be careful for haugbui were jealous guardians of their treasures,
slaying those who would disturb the sanctity of their barrows.

'Grettir took all the treasure and carried it towards the rope, but as he was making his way
through the barrow he was seized fast by someone. He let go of the treasure and turned to
attack, and they set on each other mercilessly, so that everything in their way was thrown out
of place. The mound-dweller attacked vigorously, and for a while Grettir had to give way,
but finally he realized that this was not a good time to spare himself. Then they both fought
desperately, and moved towards the horse bones, where they had a fierce struggle for a long
time. Now the one and now the other was forced to his knees, but in the end the mound-
dweller fell backwards, and there was a great crash. Then Audun ran away from the rope,
thinking that Grettir must be dead.'

Beyond their awesome physical strength some haugbui also used magic to help defend
their burial place against looters. Agnarr in Gold-Thorir's Saga sends dreams to his
potential looter, encouraging him to despoil a different howe. The draugr sorcerer
Mithothyn uses foul plagues (disease spirits) to defend his grave house.



Dvergar
The dvergar, also known as svartalfar or dwarfs, are small folk, originally created by
the gods from the maggots that had crawled through the flesh of slain Ymir. Dvergar
are smiths and craftsmen without match. Masters of secret knowledge they crafted the
greatest treasures of the gods, Freyja's necklace, Thor's hammer, Sif 's hair, Freyr's ship
and many others.

Fearing sunlight, which turns them to stone, the dvergar live in Svartalfheimr, which
reputedly lies beneath Midgard's surface and hoard their gold and jewels. Their avarice,
cunning and maliciousness are legendary. Two dwarf brothers deliberately murdered
Kvasir and brewed the mead of poetry (Odhroerir) from his blood. They sometimes steal
women and children, seemingly because there are no female svartalfar to comfort them.

Dvergar are skilled in magic, particularly the runes. They never pass on their knowledge
however, save to teach an occasional mortal the true art of smithing. If tricked, dvergar
often place terrible curses on items that they were forced to make or riches are stolen
from them, causing great harm to those who later own such treasures.

Although often grudging, ill tempered and untrustworthy, the dvergar can be loyal
friends to men who treat them well.

Like their brethren the Alfar, Dvergar vary in skill and magical ability according to the
style of campaign. As craftsmen however, the dvergar are peerless and should exceed
well beyond 100%.


Fylgjur
The Vikings believe that everyone has a guardian spirit called a fylgjur, to help ward
that person from harm. The fylgjur is part of the soul, which manifests in the shape of
an animal. Normally this spirit only becomes visible when the person is asleep and its
form is influenced by the personality of the person being guarded. The fylgja of brave
men are fearless animals such as boars or bulls, those of crafty men might be foxes,
whilst the guardian of a fearful person might be a timid hare or bird.

Traditionally it is polite to follow a guest outside when seeing them through the door,
granting their fylgja a chance to catch up and not be caught inside. Fylgjur can alert
their ward to danger, be it a looming accident or waiting enemy, in several ways. As
an unseen spirit sometimes they bang on a nearby door or wall to draw notice to an
approaching or hidden threat. At other times, the fylgja takes animal form and ventures
from the sleeping person, passing on visions of what they see in the form of dreams.


Famous Dwarfs
*	 Alvis: Promised Thor's daughter for his wife in exchange for forging weapons for
the Æsir but was tricked by Thor and turned into stone.
*	 Andvari: Cursed his treasure hoard stolen by Loki to pay the blood fine for Otr's
death.
*	 Otr: A shape-shifter who delighted taking the form of an otter but was accidentally
slain by Loki.
*	 Brokk and Sindri: Two brothers, who fashioned the spear Gungnir, hammer
Mjollnir, ship Skidbladnir, ring Draupnir, Sif 's golden Hair and the boar
Gullinburs.
*	 Durin: Second in command of the dwarfs, who with the aid of Dvalin helped
forge the sword Tyrfing.
*	 Dvalin: The father of the dwarfs, who taught his descendents the power of runes.
*	 Fjalar: With his brother, Galar, he killed Kvasir and made the mead of poetry from
his blood.
*	 Ivaldi: The sons of Ivaldi 'The Mighty' were Brokk and Sindri.
*	 Lit: The misfortunate dvergar cremated with Balder and Nanna.
*	 Modsognir: Chief of the dvergar.
*	 Nordri, Austri, Sudri and Vestri: the four dwarves, chosen by the gods to protect
the four ends of the sky.
*	 Althjof : The 'Mighty Thief ' maker and stealer of the sword Naglhring.
*	 Dvalin, Alfrig, Berling and Grer were the creators of the necklace Brisingamen.



Seeing one's own fylgja is a sign that doom is close at hand, since that part of their soul
has detached itself in preparation for death.

Fylgjur can also be quite dangerous in their own right. Whilst manifested as an animal
the spirit can interact as that beast, physically harming those it perceives as threats. An
example from Hrolfr Kraki's Saga is Bodvar Bjarki, who falls asleep under a tree before
a battle during which his fylgjar manifests in its bear form to aid his king.

'Hjorvardr and his men saw that a great bear went before the men of King Hrolfr, nearest
to where the king was; he slew more men with his paws than five other warriors of the king;
hewing- and shot-weapons bounced off him, and he broke under him both men and horses
of the host of King Hjorvardr and all which neared him he crushed with his teeth, so that
ill murmuring came into the host of King Hjorvardr... ...then the bear vanished away from
the host, and the battle grew very heavy.'

Fylgjur are, for the purposes of Legend game mechanics, the 'fetch' of every Adventurer,
whether or not they are shamanists. When viewed with some form of second sight or
mystic vision, each person's fylgjur is revealed, allowing the viewer an insight into the
personality and current temperament of those before them.

Unless an Adventurer is a full shaman who has mastered his fetch, players have no
direct control over when their fylgjur acts or what it does. It is merely the form that
they take in spirit combat; and a tool with which a Games Master might allow some
supernatural intervention to aid the Adventurers.

For the expenditure of a Hero Point, an Adventurer can invoke his fylgjur to either:
*	 Grant an immediate premonition of imminent peril, hidden or not.
*	 Whilst sleeping, experience a dream revelation of nearby nefarious deeds.
*	 Manifest as an animal to physically aid its unconscious ward.

A shaman, fully awakened to the powers of his fylgjur fetch can command these
abilities at will.

No Characteristics are given for fylgjur, since each one has its own distinct form.
A table of example animals is provided though to randomly generate the animal. If
desired, the Games Master can choose a fitting creature, which matches the personality
of an Adventurer, or better still, allow the other players to vote on what they think is
most suitable!

The STR, CON, SIZ and DEX of the animal are always those of an average creature
of that species. However, its INT, POW and CHA (where appropriate) are those of the
Adventurer. Fylgjur are normally immune to mundane harm but can be hurt by magic
or ensorcelled weapons. Any damage inflicted on a physically manifested spirit harms
the Adventurer also. Thus a critically injured fylgjur can cause the death of its host.

Jotnar
The jotnar are the giants of Viking mythology. There are many different types of
jotnar but they share the one simple aspect – they are all big or huge. Many of
the Æsir are married to giantesses or are the children of them. Odin, Thor, Tyr,
Heimdallr and Loki all have giant blood running in their veins, despite the fact that
giants were viewed as the traditional enemies of the gods. Some giants maintained a
close friendship with the Æsir seeking peace between their peoples.

Hrimthursar are the rime and frost giants. They originally lived in Niflheimr but
almost all were drowned in the blood of Ymir when he was slain. From the survivors
were descended the new races of giants, which spread across the worlds. Hrimthusar
sometimes lure travellers in the cold, charming them with soft words so that they fall
asleep and freeze.

Eldjotnar are the fire giants, who wait patiently in the realm of Muspelheimr
for the day of Ragnarok. They are ruled by Surtr their lord who will slay Freyr
in the final battle and destroy the world. Eldjotnar are rarely seen outside their
volcanic lands.

Bergrisar are the mountain giants. They also live in Jotenheimr, literally Giantland.
Utgard is the most prestigious stead of Jotunheimr, a mighty hall or citadel ruled by
Utgardloki. The Bergrisar lack the cold or heat of their brethren but still possess great
strength and often give birth to monstrous offspring, such as the wolves of Jarnvidr
(Ironwood).

Despite a reputation for being dim-witted, not all giants are slow of thought.
Mimir was a particularly wise giant who helped Odin on the path to wisdom.
The giant was so sagacious that after his death, Odin kept Mimir's decapitated
head to ask it questions. Utgardloki was particularly clever, managing to outwit
even Loki himself.

Although the eddas and sagas relate tales of primordial giants of colossal size, the
following giant Characteristics remain modest. In Legend a huge giant is near
unbeatable, so to preserve game balance and instil some common sense in terms
of Æsir-Jotnar marriages, these giants are more modestly scaled. This enables even
normal humans the chance to defeat a giant in combat; a truly heroic deed.

Important or primordial jotun can be given more STR and SIZ to reflect their
importance. Jotun chieftains should use 2D6+6 for intelligence to reflect their
cunning.

Combat Styles

Combat Notes
Jotnar weapons are bigger than human versions in terms of Size and Reach, inflicting
more damage. Giants normally try to use Bypass Parry or Damage Weapon against an
enemy's shield, to allow their crushing blows to land unimpeded. Another favourite
technique is to use Bash in order to keep from getting swamped by multiple opponents.
When throwing rocks, the missiles tend to Stun Location due to their inherent mass, in
addition to any manoeuvre chosen by the giant.

Magic Notes
Frost giants are immune to cold and can control the weather in their realm to summon
blizzards, call forth icy winds or invoke a freezing cold. Anyone caught outside shelter
during these conditions loses a level of fatigue for each hour of exposure unless they can
make an opposed Resilience test against the Giant's Persistence.

Fire giants likewise are immune to heat and can immolate themselves at will. At the start
of each round, those in close proximity must succeed in an opposed test of their Resilience
against the Giant's Persistence, or take 1D4 points of fire damage to all Hit Locations.

Those giants who live in the oceans, at the bottom of lakes or behind waterfalls can
breathe water without harm. Sea jotnar in particular can control the weather upon the
ocean. The maximum wind strength a giant can raise (or calm) is equal to his or her
Persistence skill value.

Kraken
Although technically never named directly in any of the sagas, save as the sea creatures
hafgufa and lyngbakr, the Kraken is a Norse monster of the late Viking period. They
are giant squid, which cause mighty whirlpools that can sink ships. After storms or the
naturally occurring maelstroms off the Icelandic and Norwegian coast, their bodies are
sometimes washed to the surface.

The following kraken is a 20 metre long monster worthy to set upon a Viking longship.
The two main tentacles are 15 metres long, whereas the lesser 'arms' are only five metres
in length. Each limb is lined with suckers inside of which are viciously sharp hooks.
At the base of the tentacles and arms is the feeding mouth, a large beak capable of
shredding prey before it is swallowed.

Combat Notes
Kraken normally attack with their two long tentacles, plucking up small prey, which
is passed to the eight shorter 'arms' around its beak. Any attack by a tentacle or arm
automatically gains the Grip manoeuvre in addition to any others won in combat.

Unless driven to a berserk fury a kraken usually attacks stealthily; plucking several
victims from a ship to fill its stomach and retreating under the waves. If the kraken
is upset with the ship itself, it will grasp the vessel and create a whirlpool to drag the
entire ship under in 1D6+1 rounds.


Landvættir
Landvættir are the spirits of the land who control its fertility and fortune. They can live
in the wilderness, residing in oddly shaped boulders, pretty pools or waterfalls; or they
reside on farmsteads, looking after the running and protection of the stead.


Huldra
Wilderness nature spirits have a myriad of different names and titles. Collectively
known as the Huldra Folk they encompass many of the stone, water or forest spirits
such as bergbui (rock dweller), Sjora (water spirit) or skogsfru (forest nymph). A huldra
can be of either gender.

Their powers are many and varied but normally they leave people well alone unless
someone profanes their sacred location or they seek sexual gratification. Those who
satisfy their desires are rewarded but those who fail to perform are often killed.
However some huldra, like the Nykr, are naturally malicious seeking only to kill those
who wander close enough to ensnare.

A huldra is normally an intangible spirit but can manifest a physical form of great
beauty, which has a hidden animal or plant-like feature of some sort that can only be
seen from behind; bark like skin on their back or a cow, fox or fish's tail for example.
Although a manifested landvættir may be physically harmed, killing the body does
not destroy the spirit, which may reform the following day suitably angered by the
experience. To defeat or drive off the spirit requires magic or the protection of a shaman.

Combat Notes
A huldra is normally tied to a physical location – a rock, tree or pool – which is their
home. From this place they can command the lesser Nature spirits residing in their
domain. The physical form of the huldra must emerge from or dissipate into the object
to which they are naturally tied. They cannot venture more than a quarter of their
POW in kilometres away from their home.

Although physically strong, they are only moderately dangerous in combat unless they
attack from surprise, often using their ability to shape-shift or seduce to bring a victim
into intimate range. They either use their strength to strangle, or as in the case of Nykr,
drag foes into rivers or pools of water to drown them.

Huldra cannot Discorporate an enemy but must battle them physically. However, they
can summon and direct local Nature Spirits, which can be done automatically with the
expenditure of a Magic Point.


Tomte or Nisse
Tomte are spirits that live on steadings, helping to look after the running of the farm.
When manifested they take the form of diminutive, elderly men with full beards,
dressed in woollen clothing and wearing a dyed woollen hood or cap. They are rarely
seen however, only coming out when people sleep or using magic to remove themselves
from notice. Despite their small size, rarely growing above waist height, they are
ferociously strong, capable of performing superhuman feats of labour.

Although the tomte were generally beneficent spirits, they could become violent or
even malicious if not kept appeased. A minor offence might result in the spirit boxing
the offender's ears, whereas a catastrophic insult could cause the spirit to burn down a
barn or kill all the livestock.

The way to insult a tomte could be any of the following:
*	 Changing the way the farm is run.
*	 Swearing or urinating in his presence.
*	 Failing to set a place for the spirit at the table.
*	 Playing loud music when it wants to sleep.
*	 Maltreating the animals on the farm.
*	 Forgetting to sacrifice food to it at the customary blot.


Conversely, a tomte will repay acts of kindness and respect, greatly reducing the work
necessary to run the farmstead. Not only do they engage in physical labour but they
also act to protect the stead and its family. For example, they drive away evil spirits or
wake the occupants if an unnoticed fire breaks out.

For Characteristics and abilities, treat Tomte as Alfar; save that their STR is 2D6+18
and SIZ is 1D6+3. In addition tomte know the galdr magic of Remain Unseen.


Mara
A mara is an evil nightmare that 'rides' a human or animal as they sleep. They are
considered the ill-intentioned sendings of seid-witches or Lapp shaman, who wish to
punish or even kill a victim.

Mara are formless terrors, which enter a home through cracks in windows, knot-holes
in wooden walls or even smoke holes in a roof. Although discorporate, their presence
can be sensed by the faint whispering noises of their passage. Once reaching the person
they sought, they attack from the Spirit World, leaping atop and slowly crushing them
as if under a great weight.

Externally the sleeping victim begins to slowly writhe and sweat, groaning from the
assault but unable to move a limb to escape. The dreamer however, sees some dark
presence resting upon their chest in a shadowy semblance of some sort of animal.

'Drífa prevailed upon Huld by gifts that she should conjure Vanlandi back to Finland or
else kill him. At the time when she exercised her seidr, Vanlandi was at Uppsala. Then he
became eager to go to Finland; but his friends and counsellors prevented him from doing
so, saying that most likely it was the witchcraft of the Finns which caused his longing.
Then a drowsiness came over him and he lay down to sleep. But he had hardly gone
to sleep when he called out, saying that a mara rode him. His men went to him and
wanted to help him. But when they took hold of his head the mara trod on his legs so they
nearly broke; and when they seized his feet it pressed down on his head so that he died.'

- Ynglinga Saga

In Vikings of Legend mara are considered to be the fylgjur of sorcerers skilled in
shamanism, sent to possess the victim. The appearance of the mara depends on the
animal soul of the sender. Spirit Combat can only occur when the target sleeps but
once initiated the victim perceives their Magic Point loss as the gradually increasing
weight of the thing on their chest.

If possession is successful, the fylgjur can either plague the victim with terrible dreams
thought up by the sorcerer, or it can simply dissipate the soul of the victim, killing them.


Nyke
Nyke are malevolent spirits that adopt the forms of beautiful horses, which lure riders
onto their backs. Once mounted the nyke then plunges into the nearby pool or river
to drown the rider, who remains affixed to the horse. The only chance of survival is to
perform magical preparations before meeting the creature, refuse to be seduced into
touching or mounting it, or attempt to kill the Nyke's physical form before drowning!

Nyke usually demand to be propitiated with human sacrifices or they begin to feast
on those children living nearby. For Characteristics, see Huldra on page 205. Nyke in
addition know the galdr magic of Hold Fast.

Orm
An orm or wyrm is a serpentine, legless Scandinavian dragon. Although they lack the
fiery breath of their continental cousins, ormar are possessed of terrible venom, which
poisons and asphyxiates those who press too close.

The race of ormar is twofold. Those which live in the ocean deeps, sired by great
Jormungand, are called sea serpents. Those that make their lairs in the barrows of old
kings are known as dragons and are often winged. Few orm involve themselves with
human folk. They are content to sleep upon beds of gold or lie in the depths wrapped
around the wrecks of silver filled ships. They stir infrequently to eat but when they do
their hunger is terrible.

These Characteristics can be used for either sea serpents or Scandinavian dragons. Sea
serpents should treat any blow to the wings as a hit to the Body instead. A new hatched
orm is three metres long and has a base STR and SIZ of 2D6 and scales worth two
Armour Points. For every three metres of growth beyond that it gains two additional
points of armour and a +6 bonus to its STR and SIZ.

The following orm is a modest specimen only 12 metres long, a suitable challenge for
a great hero.

Combat Notes
A crafty and cunning fighter, wyrms strike from positions of personal advantage. An
orm in its lair will place itself to prevent being outflanked, such as at the end of the
narrow entrance tunnel where only one foe can attack at a time. If caught or lured
outside, a winged orm will take to the air, relying on its scales and aerial agility to
protect it from arrows, whilst it scythes down enemies with its tail.

Sea serpents tend to wait in ambush underwater before trying to pluck a man off
the deck. Gargantuan serpents might instead try to engulf the entire ship, crushing
it in their coils. In such a case, each round use the tail attack to inflict constriction
damage against the vessel's Construction Points, remembering to use the Hull to
reduce damage first.

Ormar use their tails in preference to their heads, trying to knock opponents prone
before biting them. Unless faced by weapons that can cause it significant damage, the
creature does not bother to defend itself, only using its Combat Actions to attack.

Orm Venom
Application: Contact/Inhaled
Onset time: Asphyxiation immediately, necrosis occurs only if bitten.
Duration: 1D10 minutes
Resistance Time: The victim must make a single Resistance roll when first breathed
upon. Failure indicates that the victim starts to suffer asphyxiation. Each bite requires
an immediate Resistance roll to see if the accumulating necrosis effect is resisted.
Potency: Orm's CON x 5
Resistance: Resilience
Conditions: Asphyxiation, Necrosis. The dripping venom sublimates into a choking
cloud, which gradually asphyxiates those in the Orm's immediate vicinity. Each bite
however will accumulate necrotic damage to that location – 1 HP of permanent
damage per failed save.
Antidote/Cure: A suffocating victim who staggers clear of the poisonous miasma into
clean air will recover from the asphyxiation in 1D6 minutes. A victim who collapses
within the cloud will die if not rescued and resuscitated. A successful Healing roll used
to treat the necrosis will allow that location to heal naturally. Failure means the flesh is
permanently destroyed. Only one attempt can be made per location.


Troll
Surprisingly the word Troll and its associated monster concept do not actually exist
in the Viking period. However, for those who would sorely miss the ubiquitous troll,
assume that they are a type of man eating ogre which dwell in watery places, such as
deep fjords or behind waterfalls. Use the Characteristics of a jotun, give them water
breathing and make them immune to weapons unless rendered incapacitated first by
the use of wrestling – as per Draugr.


Were-creatures
Almost all monstrous were-creatures are either shape-shifters who have forgotten their humanity,
or poor fools who have donned a cursed shape-shifting skin that they cannot remove. (Willing
shape-shifters are handled using the Shape-shifting skill in the Magic chapter.)

Unlike the traditional lycanthrope of European legend, an accursed Scandinavian
shape-shifter does not change his form back and forth according to the moon. They
are either under a cyclical curse of the enchanted skin, every evening or every ninth day
for example; or they are permanently trapped in the animal shape, only returning to
human form when killed.

'It was his custom to get up early and go about men's business or where there was smith-
work...But every day when evening came, then he became peevish, so that few men could
speak with him; he was prone to sleep in the evenings. That was said among folk, that he was
greatly hamrammr; he was called Evening Wolf '

- Egils Saga

Unwillingly trapped within a different form, most folk become semi-sapient monsters,
driven by impotent rage or a lust for killing, victims of the animalistic passions they
have adopted. This often places them at odds with local inhabitants, especially if the
beast develops a taste for livestock or human blood.

Due to the natural invulnerabilities they gain in their cursed shape, were-creatures can
be very dangerous foes.

To generate the Characteristics of a were-creature, simply use the average STR, CON, SIZ
and DEX values for that type of animal and make them immune to mundane damage.


Unique Creatures
The following creatures are legendary beings from Viking mythology. These include
some of the terrible monsters destined to kill the gods at Ragnarok. To save space,
rather than repeating Characteristics for creatures which may never be used, a guideline
is provided to allow Games Masters to quickly stat out each one.


Legendary creatures possess these traits:
*	 Maximum values for their Characteristics.
*	 An additional 10 AP added to their natural Armour Points.
*	 A raised intellect, 7 for herbivores, 2D6+6 for carnivores.
*	 Carnivores can communicate with speech.
*	 The Size, Reach and Damage Dice of natural weapons, all raised by one step.

Although this list only includes famous creatures from the eddas, there is nothing
preventing a Games Master from generating his own unique monsters, which can be
found wondering the nine worlds.


Audumla
The primeval first cow of gargantuan size, born from the ice of Ginnungagap. Her
milk fed Ymir, the first of the giants, and his offspring. The great cow fed on the salty
rime surrounding Ymir, eventually freeing Buri from the ice. Audumla still grazes the
inhospitable places of the nine worlds, licking ice and searching for salt. The maximised
Characteristics of Audumla are of an auroch of triple STR and SIZ.


Fafnir
Originally a dwarf, the son of Hreidmar and brother to Regin and Ottr. When the
cursed ring Andvarinaut was used to pay the weregild for his Ottr's death, Fafnir
killed his father for the ransom and assumed the form of a dragon to better guard
his treasure. Regin, also seeking ownership of the hoard reforged the sword Gram for
the hero Sigurd, who slew Fafnir with it. The blood of Fafnir allows the drinker to
understand the speech of birds and eating his heart grants an increase in strength. Fifnir
is a traditional Dragon as described on page 64 of the Monsters of Legend.


Grendel
Grendel was a terrible man eating creature of iron claws and great strength, who
haunted Heorot, the hall of the Danish king Hrothgar. Grendel kept to the darkness
and lived in an underwater cave with his mother, an even more fearsome monster.
Both were protected from harm by her spells, so that no warrior could harm him
until the hero Beowulf arrived and possessing his own superhuman strength, ripped off
Grendel's arm whilst wrestling. The following night Grendel's mother came to the hall
to extract murderous revenge, forcing Beowulf to follow her back and swim down to
the subterranean lair. Finding her hide to be protected by sorcery too, he wrestled once
again before slaying her with a mighty blade found in the cave. Her severed head took
four men to carry back to Heorot. Grendel and his mother can be modelled as trolls,
as described in the previous section.



Fenrir
One of the three monstrous offspring of Loki and the giantess Angerboda, Fenrir had
the form of a wolf. He was kept at Asgardr with the Æsir who grew slowly more
frightened of him as he grew to gigantic proportions. The gods tried to trick Fenrir
with a game where they bound him in chains. The monstrous wolf agreed to play,
confident in his great strength. Twice they bound him and twice he shattered the links
with ease. The third time however, they used a magical rope made by the dwarfs.
Fenrir, suspicious of the binding, only agreed to be bound if someone placed their hand
in his mouth as a guarantee that he would be released afterwards. Of all the gods only
Tyr was courageous enough, so when the wolf was unable to break Gleipnir, his hand
was bitten off. The gods took Fenrir and tied him to a great boulder (Gjoll) and drove
it deep into the earth. Then, to make sure, they covered that rock with another huge
boulder (Thviti). To gag Fenrir's howls of rage, they shoved a sword into his mouth so
that the hilt was in its lower jaw and the point in the upper, which only made him howl
more horribly. Fenrir is fated to kill Odin at Ragnarok. The maximised Characteristics
of Fenrir are of a wolf of triple STR and SIZ.


Garm
The very hound of Hel, Garm is a guard-dog of enormous size and savagery. He was
chained outside the cave Gnipahellir, guarding the entrance to Niflhel. Whilst the hound
has no particular enmity against the Æsir, it is fated to break its chain and die whilst slaying
Tyr. The maximised Characteristics of Garm are of a hound of quadruple STR and SIZ.


Jormungand
Another of the three monstrous offspring of Loki and the giantess Angerboda,
Jormungand was cast out of Asgardr by Odin and the wyrm landed in the ocean where
it began to grow to titanic proportions. Thereafter it was known as the Midgardormr, or
the Midgard Serpent. The serpent became a personal foe of Thor who met the creature
twice, once in a test of strength when it was disguised by Utgardloki as a cat. The second
on a fishing trip with Hymir, when Thor caught Jormungand and began to pull it up
into the boat but the terrified giant cut the line before Thor could kill the wyrm with
Mjollnir. Jormungand is fated to be slain by Thor at Ragnarok but the thunder god will
be overcome by the serpent's venom. The father of all wyrms, large enough to encircle the
world, is beyond the scope of even the gods themselves, so no characteristics are provided.


Nidhogg
The dragon that gnawed at the roots of Yggdrasil, Nidhogg laired near the Hvergelmir,
one of three sacred wells. Nidhogg was also supposed to chew on the bodies of evil doers
consigned to Nastrond the bleak beach full of serpent skin and awash with venom. The
dragon feuds constantly with the great eagle, which rests at the crown of Yggdrasil,
their insulting banter to one another carried back and forth by the squirrel Ratatosk.
The maximised Characteristics of Nidhogg are of a dragon of double STR and SIZ.


Skoll and Hati
The giant wolves that pursued the sun and the moon, Skoll and Hati were among the warg
descendants of the giantesses known as the Jarnvidur. When Skoll and Hati catch the two
gods, it will herald in the Fimbulwinter, plunging the nine worlds into frozen misery. The
maximised Characteristics of Skoll and Hati are of wolves of double STR and SIZ.

                    Viking Campaigns
Cattle die, kindred die, 
Every man is mortal:
But I know one thing that never dies, 
The glory of the great dead

Designing a Viking Campaign
As illustrated in the earlier chapters, the Viking Age is a blend of tradition,
superstition, honour and treachery. The fluid mobility of social status, wealth and
outlawry present fantastic opportunities for a Game Master to raise his Adventurers
from obscurity as slaves or poor karls to becoming kings, just like Olaf Trygvesson,
who, freed from slavery in Russia, experienced many adventures as a warrior, then
a raider, before ruling over Norway! Or perhaps even the other way around, the
Adventurers being the sons of a jarl who is overthrown and killed, spurring his sons
to seek a lifelong quest for revenge. Socially in the Viking Age nothing is impossible
because at the time, nothing was.

The Viking genre caters to every taste. It lauds heroism, integrity and honour. Yet it
breeds ruthless ambition, calculated treachery and blood feuds. The combination of
these apparent dichotomies is what gives the Viking sagas their raw feeling, where men
are killed almost casually for the most minor of quibbles but a man can be rewarded or
elevated for demonstrating bravery and honour in the face of death.

Roleplaying games set in the Viking Age possess the potential for an incredibly diverse
range of events. Scenarios can include such things as discovering new lands, being
exiled, corrupt law cases, slave uprisings, open murder, dangerous sea voyages, religious
intolerance, supernatural creatures, family feuding, looting and pillaging foreign cities,
war – the scope is near limitless! A good campaign will mix these differing occurrences
together; keeping a couple as the core thread that draws the Adventurers along, whilst
others can provide exciting diversions.

Before creating a Viking campaign, the Games Master should think carefully about
the following issues. Each will have a significant bearing on how games are run, from
cultural roleplaying to Adventurer survivability and thus the enjoyment that players
will gain from it.


Family
Of the greatest importance to any Viking is their family. Although the father was the
head of the household, his authority was not absolute; the mother often owning a great
deal of influence in her own right. Sons and daughters are expected to respect their
parents but once reaching the age of majority are not legally required to do so.

Thus there is a degree of social freedom within any family but only so far. A daughter
who engages in an unapproved relationship before marriage may well find her lover
slain for his disrespectful behaviour, whereas a son who angers his father too much
might be disowned, kicked off the farmstead and left to find his own way in life.

Beyond the authority of the parents was the importance of kinship. In a society where
law cases are decided by pseudo-democratic consensus, it is wise to keep on friendly
terms with your brothers and sisters so as to draw upon the votes of their families' men
folk. The number and reputation of your brothers, uncles and sons also has bearing on
those who wish to declare a blood feud against you – the larger your extended family,
the more intimidating the retribution your relatives might enact.

In general, family members are highly prized. Unless outlawed or disowned, your
family will always provide you with a place to stay and food to eat, with the unspoken
agreement that, if your fortune changes, you will return the generosity. A family
member who reaches high station, perhaps becoming a chieftain or jarl, is expected to
use nepotism to elevate the fortunes of his relations, granting them boats or lands of
their own. Similarly, since at this time Scandinavia has no banks or professional money
lenders, if you need to purchase something or pay off a weregild, then it is your family
who combined their resources to help you out.


Wealth
Unlike some high fantasy games, the wealth of Adventurers is of considerably less
importance in the Viking World. Since hospitality is freely given and there are very few
available sources of equipment or possessions save for what you make for yourself, the
need for ready money is undermined. A ship full of silver has no use when there is very
little to spend it on.

Wealth is not really measured in how much jewellery or hack-silver you have squirreled
away in a hole in the ground. Buried money can be stolen or will eventually run
out. True wealth is land, legally free-held land beyond the reach of jarls and kings. A
productive steading is the only thing guaranteed to provide a man and his family a
means of independently supporting themselves. A freehold however is so valuable that
it is rare to find anyone willing to exchange it, even for a shipload of beaver furs.

Expensive goods and the profits from raiding still have some value however. Gifts are
a standard way of showing friendship and improving one's own reputation and when
the yearly market arrives some of it can be bartered for more useful items such as
fancy clothes or new weapons. For those with a lust for adventuring, their accumulated
wealth could be used to pay for a ship to be built, fund an overseas expedition to find
new lands (with an eye to becoming a landowner themselves), or raise an army of
mercenaries to make war.

Thus wealth is not really an important objective to the average Viking. Land or rank
is far more valuable.

Retribution and Blood Feud
A famous quote once said 'An armed society is a polite society'. Unfortunately during
the Viking Age the opposite consequences occur. Since every free man has the right
to bear weapons and is on the guard for any insult to his honour, fights are all too
common. These resulted in frequent maiming and death, even when fought without
weapons. Most of the Icelandic sagas are tragic tales of death and retribution, often
leading to the eradication of entire families.

An interesting aspect of the Viking world is their attitude to this violence. Although
killing per se was not a criminal act, the way you killed someone affected the
punishments levied at the thing if you were brought to court over it. Accidental deaths,
such as crimes of passion or negligence, were fined by compensation. Weregild however,
could be refused, precipitating a vendetta between the killer and the dead man's family
and friends.

A Viking who secretly assassinates another man is someone to be despised; those found
guilty of it are often outlawed for life and all their possessions confiscated. Open
murder is a different matter entirely. Any man who feels his personal honour has been
irrevocably insulted by the deeds of another has the right to seek retribution. Normally
a formal declaration of intent is made against the insulter, messengers sent to his family
to give fair warning that his life is now under threat. Killing a man after declaring your
intension was only punishable by temporary exile for up to three years.

Being outlawed is supposed to prevent the escalation of deaths, which accompany
blood feuds. Unfortunately, those sentenced as outlaws are often pursued overseas by
vengeance seekers and some feuds result in the loss of multiple generations of family
members.

Games Masters with players who like to run particularly violent or belligerent
Adventurers will find a Viking campaign well suited to the pursuit and indeed come-
uppance, of causal violence.


Law and Order
The Vikings lack any form of police force. Social stability is maintained by convention,
common sense and the law courts at the annual thing. With no dedicated law enforcers,
most men have to protect their own property against theft, pillage or blood feud. This
is why family and friends are so important. Acting dishonestly against one man of a
community may cause the ostracism of the 'criminal' by other members of his society.

Since the law applies to all and the law is defined and voted upon by the common
people, the majority of Viking folk are protected against the misuse of authority by
their elected rulers. That is not to say that cases of bribery or intimidation are unknown
but a godi, landsmann or jarl who fails to act with fairness to protect people from crime
or unjust suffering soon finds themselves kicked out of office.

A man being persecuted or cheated can appeal to the local chieftain for aid. This help,
if committed, is usually achieved by the ruler having a quiet word with the perpetrator
to stop. Few relish the threat of a blood feud breaking out, since it destabilises a region
and causes much destruction.

However, even the godi or chieftain have little direct power to directly intervene, as
there are no provisions in law for a standing body of men to act as peace enforcers.
The richest land owners might have a large number of house karls who can double as
warriors but these are normally used to run their own steads. In addition, the concepts
of arrest or imprisonment are alien to the Vikings.

If a fleet of raiders is spotted, a local chieftain or godi might be able to request the loan of
men from the surrounding farmsteads to form a levy in order to protect the region. Such
cooperative acts are necessary for group survival but are still voluntary. The concept of a
professional standing army do not exist throughout the entire Viking Age, men have to
be called to war from their farms at the request of the local jarl or king.


Combat
Combat in Vikings of Legend is very dangerous. There are few sources of magical healing
and being permanently maimed is an ever present threat. Most Adventurers have to
heal naturally, which can take weeks or even months to recover. Several guidelines
should be used to ensure that players are not rolling up new Adventurers every week.

Frequency: Although most roleplaying games emphasise combat encounters to
provide dramatic tension, a Games Master should understand that frequent combat is
not sustainable. In a historical campaign wounds are persistent, so combat encounters
should be paced to account for this. A Viking does not actually face combat that
frequently, indeed most never draw their weapons for years at a time.

Combat should be saved for the climax of scenarios, at the end of an adventurous voyage
to raid a monastery for example, or a duel at the conclusion of a blood feud. If running
an epic quest away from the relative security of a farmstead, then give the Adventurers
plenty of rest between violent encounters. After all, travelling takes a considerable time
and plenty of other types of challenge can interpose during a scenario.

Intent: Another consideration of portraying realism is that fights need not end
with killing. The Legend rules allow opponents to be defeated without unnecessary
bloodshed. Defeat should not mean instant death. In many sagas a duel often ends
with both antagonists becoming great friends, impressed with each other's prowess and
courage. In battle injured men are often left alive or offered surrender, permitted to
live in exchange for their possessions or oaths. Games Masters should lead by example,
capturing the Adventurers and seeking ransom for them or perhaps selling them into
slavery. A live warrior is far more valuable than a dead one. With that in mind, the
Combat Manoeuvres of Disarm, Trip or Damage Weapon can be used in preference to
more lethal options.

Consequences: Simply slaying everyone who you fight with will eventually end up
with an Adventurer being hunted by a veritable army of kinsfolk seeking revenge.
Unnecessary killing often earns an Adventurer a less than popular reputation, which
may cost him friends or allies. Likewise, Adventurers that fight too often may end up
being maimed. This should be taken as a chance to roleplay, rather than the ruination
of the Adventurer and Games Masters are encouraged to emphasise the reputations of
warriors with peg legs, single eyes or one hand – after all Tyr the god of victory only
had one hand too!

Pragmatism: Adventurers who are facing overwhelming odds are at liberty to disengage
from a fight. Fleeing from battle often occurs in the sagas with no significant loss of
reputation. Players should learn to judge their fights carefully and stack odds in their
favour, rather than blindly leaping into the fire. If they do flee, then let them go. Unless
they are raging berserks, most folks shy away from needless slaughter.

Opposition: The competence of the opposition in Legend is an important balancing
act. Comparative skill is more important than the amount of armour worn. Games
Masters who desire frequent combat should scale their foes' skills at between 20–30%
lower than the Adventurers. This should provide a reasonably exciting combat in
favour of the players but still retaining the chance of mishap.

Armour: Wearing armour is important if an Adventurer is planning to fight. Even a
basic quilted byrnie can save a limb from being severed into 'just' a fracture.


Politics
Viking politics are focussed upon two aspects of society; the thing and personal ambition.
Both are normally minor aspects of daily life unless a Games Master specifically plans
his campaign to develop them.

The assembly at the thing often debates law changes, which can have special importance
to Adventurers. For example, an Adventurer who favours settling his problems via
duelling, may become worried if a request is raised by one of his enemies at the thing to
make holmganga illegal and subject to fines. Another example could be if the regional
jarl requests a law change that allows him to confiscate all ships for his personal use if
he deems a sea-borne threat is likely, threatening the Adventurer's own vessel.

Since legislation must be voted upon by free men, it might fall upon the Adventurers
to gather personal support so that such proposals never pass the vote to be entered
into law. Scenarios based on law changes may reveal massive corruption, bribery by
interested parties or even intimidation tactics by rulers.

Personal ambition also calls for Adventurers to gather influence but this time to be
elected into the office of godi, jarl or king. Since these are not inherited posts and rely
upon the continual support of the people to retain, an Adventurer ruler may soon
find themselves torn between the different issues which affect his partisans and allies,
continually horse trading to maintain his authority.

Great fun can be had by using these assemblies and elections to make the Adventurers'
lives hell, their adversaries using the law itself as a weapon against them. Of course
a Games Master should take care not to alienate his players but simply wind up the
tension of the campaign. Using politics to bring down a long term enemy, who uses the
law or their position to remain beyond reach, can be an exquisitely satisfying experience
for those who normally solve their problems with a blade.


Religion
Whilst there are very few game rules in Vikings of Legend to support religion as a source
of magic, religion itself is still very important. Save for a few fanatics, Scandinavians
are universally polytheistic and continue to worship pagan deities until after the end
of the Viking Age.

A great deal of social conflict occurs between the Christian church and the pagan
common folk. Although many of the trade settlements seem open to religious adoption
and tolerance, the hinterlands are very resistant to the introduction of the 'White
Christ' of the new faith.

Why this conflict occurs is an interesting question upon which a Games Master can
base an entire campaign. Is the concept of resurrection distasteful to a warrior ethos
whose pinnacle of achievement is to be taken to Valhalla? Or does baptism sever the
link between a person and the pagan spirits, causing misfortune and crop failure?

Of course the conflict need not be a philosophical or magical one. Historically the
adoption of Christianity was primarily driven by the kings, who saw within the church
a way of unifying their countries, using religious law to enforce social conformity
and pacification. In such a campaign, religion is merely the concealing face of a more
nefarious political agenda.

The period of rule under Olaf Haraldsson in Norway was a particularly bloody one. In
his struggle to continue the spread of Christianity, he threatened those unwilling to be
baptised with the loss of their lives, their limbs and their property, burning shrines and
icons of the old gods. Eventually in revenge for his excesses and authoritarianism his
chieftains deserted him, giving their allegiance to Cnut and Olaf died in battle against
his own people.

Magic and Monsters
Throughout the book the terms Historical, Fantasy and Mythic have been used to
describe different types of campaign.

Historical campaigns generally refer to a type of game where magic is merely
superstition, does not work and no supernatural creatures exist. Conversely, a fantasy
campaign is one where magic and supernatural do exist. A mythic campaign not only
allows magic but transports the Adventurers into the realms of divine beings.

A Games Master should carefully consider whether magic in their campaign is really
magical, or simply trickery and psychology. For most forms of magic, save for Shape-
shifting and Shamanism, the rules work essentially the same but the actual truth behind
how it functions can be kept nebulous since there are few provably visible effects,
only psychological ones. Remember that everyone in the Viking Age was intensely
superstitious. People believe in the supernatural, even if it is complete mummery.

Of course, magic can be completely ignored by those wishing to run an enlightened
historical game. But Games Masters are encouraged to squeeze as much prophecy,
witchcraft, rune carving and shamanism as they can into their scenarios, even if they
are outside of their Adventurer's abilities, since it builds up a vivid image of the Viking
world as written in the sagas.

Likewise supernatural creatures need to be considered, because without many of the
most interesting Scandinavian creatures, such as the draugr or huldra, a Games Master
will be limited to using just men and animals as his foes. This need not be a detriment.
A campaign based on the Rus expansion towards Byzantium can easily be run without
such monsters, with bears, nomad archers and byzantine politics taking over as the
main points of excitement.


Climate and Disasters
Life in the northlands is not easy. A bad summer followed by a worse winter can
lead to starvation if not properly prepared for. The climate in northern Scandinavia is
extremely tough, subzero temperatures in the –30's and a metre of snow for most of
the winter can cut off farmsteads for weeks, granting some interesting possibilities for
survival adventures. In the more mountainous fjords, avalanches are possible, although
more people die from falling through thin ice when fishing or travelling along the open
roads of frozen rivers.

When the spring comes rivers become raging torrents, lakes rise and forests flood
becoming boggy and difficult to cross. Summer, especially in the north, becomes a living
hell as mosquitoes hatch in vast numbers, their bites aggravating animals so badly that
reindeer and elk flee to the top of hills to avoid the maddening plague. Viking settlers
have no such option and suffer several miserable months being bitten to distraction.

Whilst the climate in the north is tough, the Vikings suffer less in the way of natural
disasters. Off the Norwegian, British and Icelandic coasts great storms often occur,
making sailing at some times of the year exceptionally dangerous. Iceland itself
infrequently suffers volcanic eruptions, the soot, ash and poisonous gases sometimes
killing people and livestock.

Other than that, few cataclysms occur. There are no significant earthquakes, plagues
bother them rarely and fires when they happen are limited to a single stead.

Like all epic disaster movies, a little goes a long way. Climatic difficulties should be
used sparingly but when they do occur, they should provide a dangerous challenge. If
the Games Master wishes a volcanic eruption, it should be a one off event.


Period
The period in which a campaign is set is an important consideration if the Games
Master is planning to run a historical game. Political events can provide a backdrop
or even a framework for scenarios. To find a period that will provide inspiration,
Games Masters are encouraged to look at the timeline provided in the Viking Age
chapter.

Of course a decision should be made on whether history can be changed in the game.
If history is inviolate, it makes it difficult for Adventurers to achieve fame in their own
right and forces the Game Master to keep key historical figures sacrosanct until certain
events occur. Of course, Adventurers can still work behind the scenes to cause history
to turn out the way it does, or alternately the players could unknowingly take the parts
of real historic personages!

Without inviolate history, Adventurers can derail the timeline completely by their
actions. This allows players the freedom to act without unnecessary constraint. In some
ways this can be a very enjoyable option since you can then generate the future as
desired and keep the more historically knowledgeable players guessing!


Using Sagas as Sources
One of the best things a Game Master can do before running any Viking campaign is
to dip into the plethora of Scandinavian eddas and sagas. Most are available free on the
internet to read, conveniently broken down into their component stories.

Most of the sagas are reasonably short and save for the odd piece of archaic language
(due to many of them being translations nearly a century old) they are easy to read.
Most are highly entertaining reads too, full of insults, treachery, strange magic and
plenty of gruesomely described fighting scenes. Many of the quotes in this book have
been taken directly from these stories.

'Then ran up a fellow of Thorir's and smote at Uspak, but he thrust forth his axe, and the
blow took the shaft thereof and struck it asunder, and down fell the axe. Then cried out
Uspak, and bade his men flee away, and himself fell to running; but as soon as Thorir arose,
he cast his bill at Uspak and smote him on the thigh, and cut through it on the outer side of
the bone. Uspak drew the bill from the wound and cast it back, and it smote the man in the
midst who had erst cut at Uspak, and down he fell dead to the earth.'

The benefits of reading a saga or two before running a Viking campaign are priceless.
Not only do you gain a feel for the atmosphere and culture of their society but the
brutal combats were originally inspirations for the Legend combat rules themselves. In
fact a Games Master could simply take the plot of something like Egil's Saga or Grettir's
Saga and use as is, with no work necessary for Non-Player Characters, locations or
(where applicable) magic and monsters. An entire campaign written out for you!

Some recommended sagas are:
*	 Arrow Odd's Saga – A tale full of every type of magic, enchanted items, Lapps,
giants and battles – even a description of an enemy getting his face ripped off!
This rip-roaring adventure also has a classic example of wyrd, when Orvar-Odd
succumbs to his fate he cleverly tries to avoid.
*	 Beowulf – Although this is an anglo-saxon story, it concerns the Scandinavian
hero fighting Grendel and its mother in Denmark, followed by Beowulf 's climatic
battle against the dragon back in Gotaland. An example of heroism and virtues
important to Viking culture.
*	 Egil's Saga – The violent struggle between a warrior-poet-rune carver and king
Eirik Blood-Axe and his witch wife Gunnhild. Full of treachery and atmosphere.
*	 Gautrek's Saga – A collection of humorous tales concerning the life of king Gautrek
and the legendary story of Starkad, with lots of mythological insight and a good
list of divine blessings and curses.
*	 Gisli's Saga – A story which focuses on family relations and a feud that starts
with the revelation of past lovers and rapidly descends into murder, outlawry and
concludes with a heroic battle to the death.
*	 Grettir's Saga – Grettir is a hero cursed with a violent temper and terrible luck, who
spends his life outlawed trying to do the right thing and killing many monsters.
The tragedy is full of evocative descriptions of his fights.
*	 Havamal – A short poem that describes the important virtues of Viking culture
and also describes the gaining of the runes by Odin. An insightful work of wisdom.
*	 Heimskringla – The chronicles of the kings of Norway is a fascinating collection
of stories concerning men who became rulers of Norway. Although lacking the
traditional story elements, the accounts are still an enjoyable read and incorporate
many descriptions of battles and high level politics. A must read for a pure
historical game.
*	 Hrafnkel's Saga – The story of a duellist and devoted worshipper of Freyr who loses
his faith after suffering humiliation in the law courts and the burning of his shrine.
He travels, learning moderation before returning home to extract a just revenge on
his enemies and ending his life as a chieftain.
*	 Hrolfr Kraki's Saga – The life and deeds of the legendary king, full of seidr, berserks,
shape-shifters, treachery and battle. An exciting and magical tale.
*	 Laxdaela Saga – A tale involving a five generations long blood feud between the
families living in an Icelandic valley. Myth, romance and the twisting of fate
interwoven with bitter disputes over land, marriage, divorce and inheritance.
*	 Njal's Saga – Another epic tale concerning the inexorable destruction of families
involved in blood feuds.
*	 Volsunga Saga – The legendary story of the rise and fall of the Volsung clan, with
lots of revenge, meddling gods, giants, dwarfs, magic swords and of course Sigurd
and the dragon Fafnir.


Viking Plot Seeds
The following section provides a multitude of plot seeds for a Games Master to use
whilst first crafting their campaign. These ideas can be combined together to form more
complex scenarios or can simply be randomly selected for sandbox style campaigns.

To flesh out these scenario seeds a Game Master need only come up with a half dozen
Non-Player Characters to use as key figures during the scenario.


Hunting Scenarios
*	 When out hunting in the deep forest several days away from the nearest steading,
the party discovers a blood splattered hunter's camp. Following tracks leads them
to a pile of human bones and the tracks of an unusually large man eating wolf. The
wolf proceeds to stalk them in a series of hit and run attacks in the night but when
the party finally corner it they discover that there are two of them.
*	 The party end up in a coastal settlement and are invited to join a walrus hunt
with one of the locals. After a successful hunt, at sea in a small kayak or skiff,
an albino killer whale known as the 'White Death' turns up. With no chance of
killing it they must escape by whatever means possible whilst it toys with them,
slowly breaking their boat with each attack. Just before they reach shore, the whale
capsizes the boat and they must all swim for it leaving their guide to be eaten. The
whale will haunt their voyages for years afterwards.
*	 Invited to a steading for the Yuletime celebrations, the party are invited to
participate in a hunt. A bull elk has been caught and a gold arm ring tied to
its impressive antlers. The elk is released into the wild and the Adventurers, on
skis, must try to track and hunt it through a gradually worsening snowfall, facing
dangers from the other hunters as well as the elk itself.
*	 A deadly bear begins attacking nearby farmsteads killing entire families. The party
must destroy it but the animal seems to possess near human cunning. After several
brief encounters during times of darkness and a growing sense of supernatural
menace, the bear is killed, only to be discovered that it was one of their enemies
dressed in a full skin and using the claws to kill.
*	 The party are sent on a traditional boar hunt. Unusually there a several male
boars in the sounder, one for each Adventurer, making it an exceptionally
dangerous encounter.
*	 The party are asked to capture a live polar bear. After facing much danger on
the voyage and travelling across the pack ice, they find a baby bear. The enraged
mother soon follows.


Sailing Scenarios
*	 Rumours have been told about an island far to the north where a remote colony of
monks was set up, with the intention of building a secure church for some mystical
treasure. The trip is eventful with an incidental encounter with a sea serpent but
on locating the small island it appears abandoned. Whilst exploring the ruins their
ship is burned, isolating them with a group of hungry cannibalistic savages, the
remnants of the original monks.
*	 Whilst sailing towards Iceland, the hull of the Adventurers' ship is found to be
infested with worms and the vessel begins to slowly sink. Fortunately there is a
small boat aboard that can carry off survivors. Unfortunately there are twice the
number of crew members as there are spaces on the boat.
*	 During an erstwhile normal voyage the party's ship is attacked by another vessel
crewed with foreign Vikings, intent on piracy.
*	 Aboard a trading ship full of cargo (hopefully their own) the party are struck by a
summer squall, which soon grows into a full blown storm. The Adventurers have
to struggle to survive against huge waves pounding of the ship's structure.
*	 Whilst on a fishing trip off the coast of Norway, one Adventurer catches a kraken.
Enraged, the monster tries to sink the fishing boat by summoning a maelstrom.
*	 Sailing past an isolated craggy island, the Adventurers' ship strikes an unseen rock
beneath the water and begins to sink. They must abandon the vessel and swim to
the rocky outcrop with only whatever they can carry off the ship. The rock has
a small cave where a hermit once lived, his bones still evident. The party must
struggle to survive whilst someone with the Craft (Wood) skill builds a new boat
from the timbers, providing the party can scavenge enough food and clean fresh
water to survive.


Religious Scenarios
*	 The local Jarl turns up with an obsequious Christian bishop and his entourage in
tow. He requests that you help clear land and protect the Christians whilst they
build a stave church.
*	 After several years of famine the local folk have decided to perform a human
sacrifice to bring back the favour of the gods. However, the selection of the victim
is determined by drawn lots and by some dire fate one of the Adventurers is
chosen. If he decides to run he will be hunted. If he stays, the draw is discovered
to be rigged by an enemy.
*	 A frustrated Christian priest who has failed to convert anyone to the White God,
becomes enraged and calls down a curse against the community. The following
night the local shrine to Freyr and Thor burns down, provoking a range of opinions
about the power of the new god or whether the perpetrator should be hunted
down and killed. The priest however flees to the sanctuary of the local king.
*	 After a thunderstorm a handsome young man of huge musculature and an inability
to speak is found lying next to the shrine of Thor, or where it used to be. Over the
next few days he performs feats of incredible strength, including wrestling a bear
or shattering a boulder, before mysteriously disappearing in the next thunderstorm
several weeks later.
*	 A Christian priest arrives at the stead of a maimed Adventurer and offers to cure
the wound. If his offer is accepted the priest asks that the Adventurer be baptised
first else the power of god will not help him.
*	 After an evening of serious drinking the inebriated Adventurers, the last ones
awake, hear strange noises outside the hall. Investigating they see beautiful horses,
saddled and bridled, waiting for them. Mounting the animals will cause them to
take off through the sky and join Odin and the wild hunt. After killing a giant or
two and having a rollicking good time with the All-Father, the Adventurers will
awake back in the hall, with no explanation of why they all shared the same dream.


Battle Scenarios
*	 The Adventurers meet a Danish Viking seeking warriors who will come to Dublin
and protect it against the Irish. If they agree, they are taken to Ireland and fight in
a huge battle. If they survive they are given a large quantity of silver looted from
the fallen warriors and offered land if they wish to settle there.
*	 The Adventurers are invited to join a raid on a Frankish city. However the
expedition goes badly and they must fight their way back to the coast in a series of
increasingly desperate skirmishes.
*	 The family steads of one or more of the Adventurers are threatened by a raiding
force of Norwegian Vikings. Joining the levy, the Adventurers fight back the main
body of the raiders but discover soon after that a scouting force captured their
wives and children and dragged them off to the ships, which set sail before the
party arrives...
*	 The Adventurers are mustered as part of a huge war fleet against another Viking
nation. Both navies meet at sea, where the ships are bound together to form a huge
fighting platform. As fate has it, the ship of the opposing king ends up attacking
their vessel, granting them the opportunity to perform great deeds.
*	 Hiring on to the Danelaw army based in Northumbria, the army marches to
do battle with one of the British kings. The night before the battle however, the
infamous Raven Banner, which grants victory to the wielding side goes missing
and the Adventurers must find and recover the artefact before battle is joined the
next morning.
*	 Sailing on a raid to loot a particularly wealthy monastery, the Adventurers are
sent to scout out the stone fortifications of the large, fortified complex of religious
buildings. They discover that the monastery is garrisoned by heavily armed troops
and that the whole raid has been a cleverly laid trap. Who betrayed them and how
will the Vikings escape intact?


Law Scenarios
*	 Somebody steals an Adventurer's best clothes whilst he is performing his weekly
bath. Since clothing is expensive, this is a serious loss. However, several weeks later
at the thing the Adventurer spots his clothes being worn by a stranger. Depending
on what happens next, it turns out that the stranger bartered for the clothes earlier
that morning and might be inclined to help locate the seller.
*	 On the way home after a late feast at a neighbouring stead, the Adventurers are
ambushed by a gang of sword armed men who inflict a number of serious wounds
before discovering they have attacked the wrong men. Apologising for the mistake
they try to negotiate a settlement.
*	 During a fight against a band of outlaws attempting to steal some livestock, a
mysterious man jumps into the fray to even up the odds, fighting like a madman.
His evident skill turns the tide and if offered a reward merely asks to take shelter
for a few days whilst he heals up. If the Adventurers agree, the man proves to be
honourable and very hard working. A few days later however, a group of hard
eyed men arrive seeking the stranger. It is evident that they wish to kill him but
if prevented will arrive at the next thing with an accusation that the Adventurers
aided an outlawed man.
*	 A marriage is set up between one of the Adventurers and a wealthy young woman
of great beauty but dubious reputation. Despite any misgivings on the part of the
Adventurer, his father thinks it is a good deal and seals the contract. However, just
before the marriage the woman is found to be pregnant and the father withdraws
the suit. The woman's family then bring a law suit for breach of contract.
*	 New tenants move into the neighbouring steading and soon the Adventurers
notice that some of their livestock is missing. Laying a trap or succeeding in back
tracking reveals that the new tenants have been steeling them. Accusing them
outright brings a series of increasingly harmful acts of sabotage. Charging them
at the thing backfires when it becomes apparent that the dishonest karl is related
to the local godi.
*	 A package is delivered to an Adventurer by a man claiming to be an acquaintance
of an old friend. The package contains the old friend's sword, a famous heirloom
worth a jarl's ransom, which the friend wished to pass on before he died from
illness. Soon however, the son of the deceased friend turns up demanding the blade
as his rightful inheritance.


Monster Scenarios
*	 The father of the wealthiest Adventurer dies and is given a full ship burial, complete
with grave goods. The ceremony goes well but several weeks later livestock begins
to be found with their necks broken and throats torn out. Further investigation
uncovers rumours that the dead father has been seen wondering about. Checking
the barrow reveals that it has been plundered and his sword stolen. The Adventurers
must either find the thief or deal with the draugr themselves.
*	 A number of children from the local steadings go missing. Each has vanished
on the night of a full moon, their tracks leading to a mound reputed to be and
entrance to Alfheimr. The Adventurers must enter the mound on the following
full moon and challenge the elf who has kidnapped them to singing, dancing and
poetry tests to recover each child. To aid them a wise woman skilled in seidr should
be consulted for knowledge or galdr to win the challenges
*	 An Adventurer is jokingly challenged to prove his manhood by slaying the troll,
which local legend says lives under the nearby waterfall. A difficult swim gains
entry into a dark grotto filled with ancient treasure but disturbs a real troll who
has slept there undisturbed for decades. The monster is enchanted against iron and
huge to boot, thus its awakening promulgates a reign of terror over the region until
the Adventurers think to search its hoard to find a weapon capable of harming it
(which melts in the troll's blood afterwards).
*	 One of the Adventurers forgets to propitiate a long forgotten spirit. The tomte or
nisse begins to play increasingly deadly pranks on them. At first his drinking horn
spills over him, then the door slams on his fingers, a poisonous snake is left in his
bed and so on. This continues until the spirit receives a proper sacrifice or it gives
up in disgust and eventually attacks the Adventurer as an insanely strong midget.
*	 A jotun arrives at an Adventurer's stead and requests shelter. If invited in the giant
begins making a pig of itself, eating all the food in the longhouse, followed by
drinking all the beer and mead. If stopped the giant rebukes the host for his lack
of hospitality and proceeds to smash all the posts holding up the roof trying to
provoke a fight. If the Adventurer grits his teeth and fetes the giant to the best
of his ability, when he awakes the following morning he will discover the giant
has done him a good deed; ploughed his fields, removed all the stones from the
ground, built a new longhouse or something similar.
*	 One of the Adventurers finds an Orm in his well. The beast will consume one of
his livestock every evening and unless stopped will eat the people next if it runs
out of animals.


Blood Feud Scenarios
*	 One of the Adventurers accidentally kills another man in a wrestling match. The
man's relatives are unhappy that no weregild will be forthcoming since sporting
accidents are exempt from compensation. So at every opportunity the dead man's
family insult the Adventurer with increasingly provocative slander, hoping to spur
him into an assault.
*	 The stupid brother of an Adventurer is unable to repay a debt and asks for financial
support. The amount required is exactly the amount of wealth the Adventurer
owns, so it is likely he will refuse. If he does not help, the brother loses his freedom
and is sold as a slave to a wandering merchant, an Arab who sails away before the
brother can be bought back. The seller has no compassion for his deed and gloats
around the market about the unspeakable acts the Arab will use the brother for.
*	 On his deathbed the father of an Adventurer tells his son that he is the last member
of a family who were once jarls in another country but they had all been killed
when a rival burnt them alive in their longhouse, women and children too. Only
he had escaped. He urges his son to not be the coward he was and return to their
original home to extract just revenge.
*	 An Adventurer's uncle dies, leaving a large steading with no clear inheritor. Both
the Adventurer and another cousin have a legitimate claim and the case goes to
court. Unless the Adventurer does exceptionally well in some skill such as Oratory
or Lore (Law) the cousin wins. Later on he boasts that he bribed the Godi to skew
the case in his favour.
*	 One of the leading men in the region fancies himself as a ladies' man and forces
himself on an Adventurer's wife, sister or daughter. When the case goes to the law
court however, the man brings a veritable army of supporters with him to win the
vote. The only option remaining, save to cowardly give up, is to invoke the right
to settle the case by combat in a holmganga.
*	 An Adventurer with no remaining male relatives is approached one morning
by several cold strangers. They ask his name and declare he is the last member
of an extended family that their family has been feuding with for the last three
generations. They also state that they intend to kill him and if they fail their
remaining relatives will come to finish the job. After which they ride away to give
the Adventurer time to prepare himself for being murdered. The Adventurer must
find some way to prevent the fatalistic men from continuing the generations-old
feud or kill all of them instead.


Political Scenarios
*	 Fed up with their corrupt chieftain, local karls approach the Adventurer with the
best reputation and ask him to stand for the position of godi at the next thing. The
current godi gets wind of the plan and begins to pressure the Adventurer and his
friends.
*	 The Adventurers learn that the local ruler secretly murdered his rival in order
to win the election to Jarl. Unfortunately up until now the Jarl has treated the
Adventurers well and he is a level headed and wise leader. If they do not use the
information to have him removed from office, the informant threatens to bring a
charge against them at the next thing instead.
*	 After the locals legitimately refuse a call to muster, for an army destined to fight
overseas against a hitherto allied region, the king turns up enraged that his orders
have been ignored and pillages the region in petty revenge. The act of tyranny kills
several of the Adventurers' family members. Since the king has an army, he cannot
be stopped directly but the Allthing is scheduled for the following month and he
can be legally charged with murder if enough supporters can be gathered.
*	 The king or jarl of a neighbouring region approaches the Adventurers to see if
they would be interested in helping to overthrow their current ruler who is a petty,
ignorant man.
*	 The poorest Adventurer in the party is tracked down by a group of Danish warriors
and told that he is the closest surviving relative of their last king and that he has
been elected as the new ruler. The amazing stroke of luck turns out to be less clear
cut since the Adventurer is intended to be a puppet for one of the current jarls
seeking power for himself.


Supernatural Scenarios
*	 After slaying her son, the Adventurers are cursed by a rune carving witch who
sets up niding poles (curse poles) in a hidden location. They must try to trick the
woman into revealing the location of the poles, since killing her will not stop the
magic, or flee overseas where the curse cannot follow.
*	 At a feast hosted by the local Jarl, a volva with the power of prophesy makes
an ominous foretelling that the Adventurers will cause the death of the lord.
Obviously taken aback by the wyrd the jarl is stunned but his son leaps to his feet
and orders the huskarls to kill the Adventurers, so precipitating a full blown feud.
Wherever they go or no matter what they do the party will ultimately cause his
death, even though the jarl wishes to have peace between them.
*	 Whilst travelling away from home, the Adventurers are invited into the hall of a
tall man and fed a huge feast. During the night however, one of the Adventurer's
fylgja manifests in its animal form and discovers that the host is a man eating giant
who has hundreds of skeletons in his storehouse. When the Adventurer awakes he
remembers his dream with crystal clarity.
*	 Travelling north to the land of the Lapps the Adventurers are offered magical
fetishes of exquisite craftsmanship and some power in return for accompanying a
shaman on his spirit quest to recover the soul of a young girl ensnared by a terrible
raven spirit. During the quest the Adventurers must throw themselves in the path
of the flocks of bird spirits that try to stop the shaman.
*	 Asked to travel into the deep forests to slay some awful wolf creature, the
Adventurers must face and defeat a shape-shifter who has become trapped in
his animal form. If lacking the magic needed to harm the creature a rune carved
weapon can be found in the cave the wolf once used as its lair.
*	 Suffering an unusual string of bad luck, one of the Adventurers is told by a
mysterious old woman that his family Dis has been captured by an evil seidkona.
They must travel to her lair and break the binding that holds the spirit, which
will then protect the Adventurers from the evil eye and foul magic whilst they
slay the witch.
