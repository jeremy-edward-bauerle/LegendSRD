‘A pyrate is Hostis humanis generis, a common Enemy, with whom neither Faith nor 
Oath is kept… if Pyracy be committed on the Ocean, and the Pyrates in the attempt

Pirates of Legend brings the golden age of piracy to life! Lay hand to your cutlass 
and stick your pistols in your belt, friend – adventure is waiting for you offshore.

‘A Pyrate is Hostis humanis generis, a common Enemy, with whom neither Faith nor Oath is to be 
kept… if Pyracy be committed on the Ocean, and the Pyrates in the attempt be overcome, the Captors 
may, without any Solemnity of Condemnation, hang them up at the Main-Yard; if they are brought

— From A General History of the Robberies & Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates

The golden age of piracy lasted only three or four decades, yet its mythic legacy has endured 
now for two or three centuries. While piracy – taking and robbing ships at sea – is ancient, and 
continues to this day, the common concept of the pirate, with his devilish ways, his regalia of 
pistols and parrots and skulls, his cant and his cruelty is defined by that golden age, by the period 
roughly from 1680 to 1720, when the pirates were hunted down by the English Royal Navy. 
This book brings the pirates of that era – and other times – to life in Legend campaigns.

The Players and the Games Master should familiarise themselves with the Legend rules as found 
in the Legend Core Rulebook. When they are happy they know how to play the game then it is off 
to The Making of a Pirate chapter to roll up their pirates, with visits to the Reputation, Legendary 
Abilities & Vices, Chattels Blades & Gunshot and Crews & Sworn Companions chapters to round 
out the Adventurers.

Both Ships & the Sea and the acts of Piracy & Plunder are described in the chapters of the same 
titles, while Combat on the High Seas gives rules for all manner of encounters and battles. Ports, 
Trade and the Law gives Adventurers a place to hide out and sell their ill-gotten gains. Finally 
there are several different styles of play open to the group, which are discussed in the Campaigns 
chapter.

the making 
of a pirate

Before touching the dice, discuss your pirate with the other players and the Games Master. A 
beginning Adventurer is a young pirate, at the start of his career. Maybe he has just joined a 
pirate crew, or maybe that will happen in his first adventure. 

Adventurer Generation

Pirates of Legend are created using the standard rules from the  Legend Core Rulebook, with the 
following changes.

Part 0: Initial Concept
Why is your Adventurer a pirate? Did he run away to the sea for plunder? To escape a cruel master? 
Out of desperation? Perhaps he was kidnapped by a pirate crew, because he is a talented carpenter 
or gunner? Does he dream of retiring from the sea when he has enough money to buy the hand of 
some pretty girl, or will he be satisfied only with a mansion and a title and a pardon from the King? 
Does he want revenge on a particular foe, or does he want to send all humanity to hell?

Part 1: Characteristics
No changes. 

Part 2: Attributes
No changes.

Part 3: Basic Skills
There are two new basic weapon skills, Pistols and Longarms. See page 31 for descriptions of 
gunpowder weapons.

Many  Legend  weapons  are  no  longer  in  common  use  in  the  era  of  pirates.  Shields,  spears, 
hammers, flails and most swords are now relegated to museums or primitive barbaric tribes, as 
are bows and crossbows. Common weapons are rapiers and cutlasses, daggers, pikes and other 
polearms, and guns of all sorts. 

Part 4: Previous Experience
Primitives and Barbarians may add Longarms +10% to their list of available weapon skills.

Nomads may add both Pistols +10% and Longarms +10% to their list of available weapon skills. 
They may also add Courtesy to the list of Advanced skills they can pick.

Civilised may add both Pistols +15% and Longarms +15% to their list of available weapon skills. 
They also automatically get the Courtesy skill.

Starting Money
An Adventurer’s starting money is calculated in Spanish reales, which are roughly equal in value 
to Legend silver coins. 

In addition to an Adventurer’s starting money, he gets the set trappings of his profession and 
also some random equipment, reflecting the take-what-you-can-get randomness of the pirate 
lifestyle. See the Random Starting Equipment table.

A list of common Professions for pirate campaigns is given here but a follower of any profession 
at all could end up as a pirate. Among the pirates, a man’s past life was considered irrelevant and 
many became pirates to escape some tragedy in their backgrounds.

A  few  of  these  professions  deserve  extra  descriptions.  The  word  ‘Buccaneer’  has  become 
synonymous  with  ‘pirate’  but  it  originally  referred  to  outcasts  and  runaways  who  fled  to  the 
beaches  of  obscure  islands,  living  on  wild  pigs,  which  they  barbecued  on  wood  racks  called 
boucans. They were outlaws, the dregs of society for the most part, and often became pirates. 
Gentry are quite the opposite – wealthy people of noble blood, such as governors’ daughters. 
‘Entertainer’ covers everything from acrobats to whores, although pirates tended to be fonder 
of the latter. 

Advanced Skills
Gunnery (INT+DEX)
This covers the loading, aiming and firing of cannons and other shipboard weapons, as well as 
making grenades and powder bombs. It also teaches the Adventurer how to properly store and 
maintain such weapons.

Cooking (INT+POW)
While anyone can roast a wild pig or throw a few carrots into a pot, it takes skill and talent to 
make edible meals aboard a ship. A good cook is welcome among pirates.

Handiwork (INT)
This is the skill of making basic repairs and jury-rigging equipment. Handiwork can substitute 
for most Craft skills when it comes to maintaining and repairing a damaged vessel but cannot 
be used for more complex tasks. An Adventurer could use Handiwork to make a simple dug-out 
canoe, for example, but not to build a galleon.

Advanced Characters
These basic rules create pirates at the start of their careers, just after they have joined a pirate 
crew. Older, more seasoned Adventurers can be created using the rules for advanced Adventurer.

The rules for advanced Adventurer are used as normal in Pirates of Legend; characters get free 
Legendary Abilities instead.

A Seasoned Adventurer starts with one Legendary Ability, with a maximum Hero Point cost of 
2 or less.

A Veteran Adventurer starts with up to two Legendary Abilities, with a maximum total Hero 
Point cost of 4 or less.

A Master Adventurer starts with up to three Legendary Abilities, with a maximum total Hero 
Point cost of 8 or less.

A Veteran Adventurer starts with up to four Legendary Abilities, with a maximum total Hero 
Point cost of 12 or less.

Part Five – Finishing Touches
Pirates of Legend Adventurers get Free Skill Points as normal. 

Pirates of Legend Adventurers all have a Reputation, which is calculated slightly differently to the 
standard Reputation. 

Pirates of Legend Adventurers get Hero Points as normal. An Adventurer starts with two Hero 
Points.

Pirates of Legend Adventurers may take up to two points in Vices. 

Next, move onto the rules for creating a crew and a ship.

Random Starting Equipment
In the anarchic ports frequented by the pirates, items change hands regularly. Pawnshops do a 
roaring trade, while thieves scavenge from the losers in a brawl in a bar or a duel in an alleyway 
and inveterate gamblers or drunkards give up prized treasures for another hand of cards or bottle 
of  rot-gut  rum.  Pirate  Adventurers,  therefore,  tend  to  have  an  assortment  of  odd  items  and 
strange possessions that may or may not come in useful.

Reputation

Reputation takes on renewed importance in Pirates of Legend, as an Adventurer’s Reputation 
translates  into  influence  on  board  ship.  It  is  calculated  somewhat  differently  but  otherwise 
functions in the same way as described in the Legend Core Rulebook.

1 Most of these modifiers are cumulative. If an Adventurer is both a Master-level Adventurer and 
has recently defeated a grave nearby threat, he is entitled to both bonuses. However, he does not 
receive the bonuses for being a Seasoned- or Veteran-level character – those are subsumed by the 
Master-level bonus.

Using Reputation
For  Reputation  to  have  an  impact  on  an  Adventurer’s  life  and  dealings  with  Non-Player 
Characters, the Adventurer must make a Reputation test.

For a pirate, Reputation affects the use of the Influence skill and also determines an Adventurer’s 
sway over his crew. It also has some impact on skills such as Disguise. The Reputation Effects table 
gives some general guidelines for bonuses to skills based on the Reputation of the Adventurers.

Whether or not the Adventurer receives a bonus or penalty to his Influence test depends upon 
the nature of his Reputation and who he is dealing with.

On board a ship, there are a number of modifiers to an Adventurer’s Reputation. 

Reputation  is  especially  important  for  pirate  captains,  as  the  sight  of  a  particularly  fearsome 
pirate flag can convince some prey into surrendering immediately. 

Reputation Changes
An Adventurer who is out of circulation (marooned on a desert island, on a voyage to the other

Legendary Abilities

Even historical pirates quickly became legendary figures, their deeds and depravities exaggerated 
until they became fearsome monsters. They were said to be fearless, impossible to find when 
hiding, impossible to stop when attacking, or even in league with the Devil. In a cinematic or 
fantasy game, of course, all that could be true!

Of the Legendary Abilities in the Legend Core Rulebook, several are suitable for use in Pirates of 
Legend games.

Optional Rule: Reputation and the Great Powers
There are four major powers in the Caribbean – the English, the Spanish, the Dutch and the 
French. While all four despise pirates, they may be favourably disposed to those who harm their 
enemies and especially hostile to those who act against the Power’s interests. This is reflected in a 
special modifier to Reputation, called Standing. This modifier applies only when the Adventurer 
is in a port or on board a ship loyal to that power. Standing always adds positively to Reputation, 
making it more likely that the Adventurer will be recognised but an Adventurer with positive 
Standing  is  well  liked  and  honoured,  while  negative  Standing  means  that  the  Adventurer  is 
considered a criminal.

This adds an extra level of politics and book-keeping to the game, so it should only be included 
if the differing agendas of the powers is going to come into the campaign.

Always Something to Swing From 
Requirements: DEX 15+, Acrobatics 90%+ 
Hero Points: 8

No matter where you are, there is always a rope, line, chandelier, jungle vine, pulley, inn sign, 
flagpole  or  other  thing  to  swing  from.  Such  dramatic  acrobatics  can  be  used  to  swing  past 
opponents. You can also swing into combat as a charge, gaining a +5% bonus to hit in addition 
to the normal +1D4 bonus to damage.

Born to the Sea 
Requirements: POW 15+, Shiphandling 90%+
Hero Points: 8

When at the helm of a ship, the following effects take place:
•	

Any penalty to your Shiphandling skill is reduced by –20 %. For instance, if the driving 
rains and slippery ground would normally apply a –40% penalty to your Shiphandling 
test, the penalty is reduced to –20%.
You may increase your ship’s movement by +12 feet/1 knot.
Any  Seaworthiness  losses  are  reduced  by  one.  For  example,  if  the  ship  would  lose  5 
Seaworthiness as the result of a storm, then this loss is reduced to 4.

•	
•	

Contact
Hero Points: 2

Every time you take this Legendary Ability, you gain a trusted friend on one of the islands of the 
Caribbean. This friend will shelter you in times of need, pass on rumours and interesting tales to 
you, receive stolen goods and so forth. 

Dashing 
Requirements: CHA 13+
Hero Points: 4

You are especially stylish and charming. You gain a +20% bonus to Influence tests made against 
female  Adventurer  (female  Adventurer  may  take  a  variant  of  this  Legendary  Ability  called 
Beautiful, which gives a +20% bonus to Influence tests against male Adventurer).

Devil’s Luck
Requirements: POW 15+ 
Hero Points: 8

You are cursed or blessed with the devil’s own luck. This has two abilities: 
•	

Whenever you spend a Hero Point to get a Second Chance, you also get a +10% bonus 
to the re-roll attempt.
When  killed,  you  may  put  yourself  into  the  Games  Master’s  hands.  You  will  always 
survive but your POW is reduced by 1D6 and you will most likely end up in a very 
dangerous or unpleasant situation.

Drowned Man
Requirements: CON 15+, Athletics 70%
Hero Points: 8

You nearly drowned once and are now almost a thing of the sea. You may hold your breath 
for three times longer than normal and the Resilience test to hold your breath after this period 
expires does not suffer from a –10% cumulative penalty. Furthermore, any penalties to attacks 
and actions under water are reduced by 20%.

Fearsome Aura
Requirements: CHA 15+, any Weapon skill at 70%+
Hero Points: 12

All foes within your CHA in yards will be intimidated by your presence, suffering your CHA as 
a penalty to any Persistence or Resilience tests they are called upon to make.

In  addition,  you  may  take  a  Combat  Action  to  terrify  your  nearby  enemies,  requiring  an 
Opposed Influence versus Persistence test. If this is successful, they suffer your CHA as a penalty 
to all Weapon skills for the remainder of the Combat Round. This ability only works on the 
Adventurer scale, not on the crew scale.

Infamous
Requirements: Reputation 10+ 
Hero Points: 2

Stories of your deeds as a pirate have spread far and wide. Increase your Reputation by +5.
 
Old Salt
Requirements: Shiphandling or Boating 50%+

Vices

‘I soon found that any death was preferable to being linked with such a vile crew of miscreants, to 
whom it was a sport to do mischief, where prodigious drinking, monstrous cursing and swearing, 
hideous  blasphemies  and  open  defiance  of  Heaven,  and  contempt  of  Hell  itself,  was  the  constant 
employment, unless when something abated the noise and revellings.’

— From the account of Philip Ashton, captured by pirates in 1722

A freedom to indulge one’s lusts and appetites freely was one of the great attractions of the pirate’s 
way. On pirate ships, drink flowed freely and there was little to do but laze around (pirate ships 
had far more crew than a merchantman of similar size, so the work was divided among many 
hands). When  a  prize  was  captured,  then  the  pirates  would  gamble  their  winnings  away.  Of 
course, more pirates were captured on account of being drunk than any other reason – revels 
had their costs.

In game terms, an Adventurer may take up to two points of Vices at the start of a campaign and 
can purchase more by taking the Vice Legendary Ability. A Vice is a particularly strong desire 
possessed  by  the  Adventurer,  one  that  he  must  indulge.  Vices  are  rated  by  points;  the  more 
points, the stronger the Vice.

Vices have two game effects. Firstly, if the Adventurer deliberately indulges his Vice, he gets one 
Hero Point. A drunkard who searches for a captured ship’s rum locker instead of its strongbox, a 
gambler who willingly throws away all his hard-won silver, a seducer who chases the governor’s 
daughter instead of escaping the town – they all deserve Hero Points as recompense for their 
stupidity.  An  Adventurer  can  only  indulge  his  Vice  once  per  point  per  adventure.  So,  an 
Adventurer with two Vice Points in Drunkard could get unnecessarily and inconveniently drunk 
twice per adventure and get one Hero Point each time (he could get drunk many more times 
during the adventure but only gains a mechanical advantage once per Vice Point). 

For example, Fat Pete has three points in, surprisingly, Gluttony. As the Adventurers’ ship is sailing 
along, Fat Pete’s player describes in detail how his Adventurer has hidden his own supply of food in a 
barrel and creeps out at night to gorge himself. This Adventurer detail gets the player one Hero Point 
and he could get another two Hero Points later in the adventure for being gluttonous in other ways.

Secondly, if the Adventurer has a chance to indulge his Vice at a time when he does not want 
to, he must make a Persistence test, penalised by –20% per Vice Point after the first (so, –20% 

24
Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

at two Vice Points, –40% at three points and so forth). If the Persistence test fails, then the 
Adventurer gives into temptation. 

The Adventurers are trapped on an island by a Royal Navy patrol. Soldiers from the ship have landed on 
the shore and made camp for the night; the pirates are hiding in the nearby jungle. All the Adventurers 
need to do is wait for the soldiers to fall asleep and they can either sneak away or attack under cover 
of darkness. Unfortunately, the soldiers are roasting a wild chicken and Fat Pete’s downwind of that 
lovely smell. His stomach rumbles incessantly. Fat Pete’s player must make a Persistence test at –40% 
(Fat Pete’s a three-point Glutton). If the Persistence test fails, then Fat Pete can stand the hunger no 
more and must try to get hold of that chicken somehow.

Indulgence is chosen by the pirate’s player; Temptation is inflicted by the Games Master. 

Some Vices (like Honour) work slightly differently; see the individual descriptions.

Vices
Avarice – Gold and jewels
Blasphemy – Offending against God and civility
Bravado – You must be the bravest and most dramatic
Cowardice – You value your life above all else
Cruelty – You delight in torture 
Destruction – Blowing things up
Drink – Wine, whiskey or rum
Freedom – You cannot stand to be constrained
Gambling – Dice, cards or whatever comes to hand
Gluttony – Either fine food or lots of food
Honour – You have a code of conduct
Lust – Women of all sorts
Revenge – Against an individual, group or institution
Seduction – The thrill of the chase
Superstition – You fear ghosts and goblins
Piety – You have a deep respect for the divine
Pride – Your reputation means everything to you
Wrath – You long for combat

Avarice

do. Avaricious Adventurer cannot resist the lure of plunder. 
Indulged by: Looting treasure, counting your gold.
Tempted by: Treasure of all sorts, especially gold and jewels.
 
Blasphemy
You have quarrelled with God and hate Him and all His works. You may be an avowed Atheist, 
or believe yourself to be the Devil’s own.
Indulged by: Destroying churches, insulting priests, shocking others with your words.
Tempted by: Especially big ways to offend the Almighty or believers.

Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

25

Bravado
You are the living embodiment of the pirate myth; a devilish, dashing rogue, and you play to 
the stereotype.
Indulged by: Witty quips, dramatic entrances.
Tempted by: Showing off to the crowd when fleeing over subtlety would be preferable.

Cowardice
You are a craven rogue, interested only in saving your own skin.
Indulged by: Hanging at the back when it comes to a fight; finding cover; being scared.
Tempted by: Running and fleeing instead of fighting.

Cruelty
You delight in cruelty and torture and are thoroughly black-hearted and vile.
Indulged by: Being cruel; punishing others.
Tempted by: Chances to be unnecessarily cruel to a defeated foe. 

Destruction
No doubt you have all manner of gunpowder bombs and incendiaries about your person, for you 
love nothing more than fire.
Indulged by: Delighting in blowing things up; setting fire to things; making bombs.
Tempted by: The chance to blow something really big up.

Drink
A powerful thirst 
for all manner of 
drink is upon you.
Indulged by: 
Drinking.
Tempted by: 
Drinking.

26
Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

Wine, Whiskey and Rum
Common drinks in the age of piracy include rum, punch, wine, whiskey and gin. Grog, a drink 
associated with pirates in stories, was actually not invented until the 1740s. 

An Adventurer who drinks excessively must make a Resilience test, penalised by the strength 
of the drink. Especially potent drinks give a –20% or higher penalty. If the Resilience test 
is failed, then the Adventurer is drunk. A drunk Adventurer suffers a –10% penalty on all 
DEX and INT-based tests but gains a +10% bonus to Resilience and Persistence tests made 
to resist harsh conditions like cold or pain, or to resist intimidation. Drunkenness can raise 
crew morale. The modifiers from drunkenness do not apply to further Resilience tests to avoid 
getting drunker.

An already-drunk Adventurer can become Very Drunk (+/– 20% penalty) or Blind Drunk (+/– 
40% penalty). 

Freedom
You cannot stand to be constrained.
Indulged by: Refusing to obey any law or accepting any limit on your movement.
Tempted by: Thumbing your nose at society; escaping when you really should stay confined. 

Gambling
Be it dice, cards or the flight of gulls, you will wager on anything. 
Indulged by: Gambling.
Tempted by: Gambling.

Gluttony
You are always hungry and gorge yourself whenever you can.
Indulged by: Eating, cooking.
Tempted by: Feasting.

Honour
You refuse to break oaths or contravene your own personal beliefs.
Indulged by: Keeping to your own system of honour.
Tempted by: Holding to your own system of honour, even when it will have dire consequences 
for you (for example, letting a foe go because you gave your word you would.)

Lust
Your appetite for sexual satisfaction is boundless.
Indulged by: Whoring.
Tempted by: A willing woman.

Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

27

Revenge
You have a special hatred for a group or individual and go out of your way to defeat or injure 
them or their agents.
Indulged by: Slaying agents or foiling the plans of your foe.
Tempted by: Inflicting serious injury on your foe.

Seduction
You delight in seducing women; your pleasure is not in the conquest (although that is pleasant 
enough) but in the chase. 
Indulged by: Flirtation and seduction.
Tempted by: Inaccessible, haughty or well-born women.

Superstitious
You believe in ghosts, demons and all manner of hostile spirits.
Indulged by: Taking preparations against such horrors; finding relics; observing superstitious 
traditions.
Tempted by: Fleeing when confronted by anything that might be supernatural.

Piety
Unlike most pirates, you have a great respect for the Church.
Indulged by: Attending or celebrating mass; abhorring blasphemy.
Tempted by: Confession; protecting a church from being looted.

Wrath
You long for combat in all its forms.
Indulged by: Picking fights.
Tempted by: Picking fights you have little chance of winning.

chattels, blades 
and gunshot

While prices for various goods are given in this chapter, much of what a pirate owned would be 
taken by force. The gold and silver won from captured ships would be spent in the friendly ports 
like Port Royal or New Providence on drink and women. 

Currency
Prices are given in reales, silver Spanish coins. Spanish doubloons and pieces of eight are more 
commonly used by pirates. Doubloons are gold coins; silver pieces of eight are worth a quarter 
of a doubloon, or eight reales.

1 Doubloon = 4 pieces of eight = 32 reales

Adventurers may also encounter English crowns, shillings and pence, or Dutch ducats, daalders 
and florins. 

Melee Weapons
Belaying Pin: Belaying pins are iron spikes used to secure ropes on board a ship but they also 
make excellent improvised weapons. An Adventurer using a belaying pin suffers a –10% penalty 
to hit.
 
Boarding Axe: Boarding axes are used to cut lines and as a support when climbing, as well as a 
weapon. An Adventurer using a boarding axe gets a +10% bonus to Athletics checks to climbing 
wooden surfaces.

Boarding  Pike:  Boarding pikes are cheap spears with a hooked end. An Adventurer using a 
boarding pike gets a +10% bonus to Athletics tests when making boarding actions.

Buckler: This duelling shield is the only shield still in common use in the age of piracy.

Cat o’nine tails: A heavy, nine-tongued whip used as a punishment device.

Club: Or a tree branch, bar stool, piece of timber, crowbar…

Cutlass: A cutlass is a heavy curved sword, short enough to be used on board a ship without 
getting tangled in the ever-present ropes and lines but sharp and strong enough to cut through a 
foe. Cutlasses are used by navies the world over. Its basket hilt gives a +10% bonus to Parry tests.

Dagger: A long knife, balanced for throwing.

Dirk: Slightly larger and more damaging than a dagger, dirks suffer a –10% penalty to Parry 
attempts. 

Halberd: Polearms like this are common weapons for guards and soldiers in forts.

Hatchet: Mainly used for hewing wood or cutting through jungle but still a lethal weapon.

Knife: A simple knife.

30
Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

Quarterstaff: Rarely used as a weapon but still easy to make and obtain.

Rapier: A duelling rapier. Weapons like this are often of exceptional quality.

Scimitar:  A  wickedly  curved  sword,  more  common  in  Moslem  lands  than  in  the  west. The 
infamous Barbary pirates may use such blades. 

Spear: From weapons used by wild natives to improved spears.

Shortsword: Commonly used in combination with another blade by a duellist.

Tomahawk: Adapted from the Native American weapon of the same name, a tomahawk is a 
small, well-balanced axe that can be thrown.

Whip: A length of leather more commonly used to goad slaves than as a weapon.

Whips
Whips can be used in three different ways:
•	 As  a  direct  attack  on any foe within 10 feet (2 metres). A whip cannot be used on an 

adjacent target. Such attacks use the normal rules.

•	 As a grapple attack on any foe within 10 feet (2 metres). If the grapple attack succeeds, 
then the attacker may immediately make a Throw or Incapacitate attack but the two are not 
considered to be grappling. If the defender is allowed Riposte and the whip wielder is out of 
range, then the defender may instead choose to try to wrench the whip out of the attacker’s 
hand (use an opposed Athletics (Brute Force) test to determine who wins).

•	 As a short rope, for swinging off masts and grabbing onto railings. In certain situations, the 

Whip skill can be substituted for the Acrobatics skill. 

Gunpowder
Gunpowder is carried in either a powder horn or in prepared paper packets. It must be loaded 
into the gun along with wadding and shot. 

On a 00 (fumble), then the gun has misfired and must be loaded from scratch. On a 96-99, then 
the gun has simply failed to fire.

If a gun is not properly maintained, then the gun’s chance to misfire or fail increases. This can 
also happen with improperly stored power. 

If powder gets wet, then the misfire chance doubles at the very least, and may increase further. 
Soaked powder is almost certain not to function.

Gunpowder Explosions
Gunpowder fuses can be made using the Artillery skill, or just improved by making an INT+DEX 
test.  A powder horn will explode for 2D4 damage, or an improvised bomb for 1D4 x 1D4 
damage. A barrel of gunpowder deals 6D6 damage if it explodes.

Blunderbuss: Blunderbuss weapons fire a hail of shot, or can even be loaded with scrap and 
nails. They are rather inaccurate but devastating at close range. Blunderbusses suffer a –20% 
penalty to hit at long range but do an extra 1D6 damage at short range.

Grenade:  Grenades  are  bottles  or  iron  casks  filled  with  powder  and  metal,  which  explode 
violently. They are commonly used in boarding actions, scattering an enemy crew before the 
pirates attack.

Musket: Muskets fire a heavy lead ball. They are the commonest firearm in this era.

Pistol: Pistols are smaller versions of muskets. Most pirates have at least a pair of pistols and 
some carry four or five, so they can keep firing without needing to stop and reload.

Pistol, Blunderbuss: A blunderbuss pistol is a wide mouthed gun that works just like its larger 
cousin. It suffers a –20% penalty to hit at long range but does an extra 1D4 damage at close 
range.

Pistol,  Pocket:  Pocket  pistols  are  small  enough  to  be  concealed  and  are  generally  seen  as  a 
coward’s gun or a hold-out weapon. An Adventurer can hide a pocket pistol inside a pocket or 
secret compartment.

Rifle: Rifles are a new form of musket; grooves are carved into the inner surface of the barrel, 
making the shot spin when fired, resulting in a more accurate attack. Effectively, a rifle is an 
Exceptional-quality musket, effect giving a +10% bonus to hit.

Duellists Half-Cape: This is a length of flexible cloth that is often cut into a draped cape of sorts 
that hangs over the chest and unused arm during a swordfight. A number of stiff leather strips 
are sewn into the cape here and there, giving additional protection to the areas they cover. The 
half-cape’s construction allows it to be twirled over one arm or the other as a Combat Reaction. 
This adds the cape’s Armour Points to the covered arm if desired. Also, if taken from around the 
chest and held in one hand, the half-cape can be used like a buckler – offering no AP protection 
but allowing a +10% bonus to Parry skill tests.

Buff Coat: A heavy jacket, commonly worn by sailors.

Pitch Jacket: A linen shirt or jacket, covered with hardened pitch. Easy to improvise on board 
a ship.

Breastplate: Some soldiers wear still metal breastplates as a defence against enemy blades.

Pirates wear a gaudy mish-mash of clothing, ranging from rags to fine jackets and boots taken 
from the dead, together with head-scarves, gold jewellery and all manner of trinkets, curios and 
charms.

Clothes Maketh The Man
When  dealing  with  the  aristocracy  and  the  authorities,  fine  clothes  are  a  requirement.  An 
Adventurer suffers a modifier to all Courtesy and Influence tests depending on his dress in any 
encounter with wealthy, respectable types in civilised surroundings (obviously, Influence works 
very differently if the wealthy gent with his fine powdered wig is kneeling on the deck with a 
cutlass at his throat).

crews and sworn 
companions

A  pirate  crew  is  a  brotherhood  of  rogues,  united  by  a  common  desire  for  plunder. They  are 
not a disciplined military unit, nor do they give false respect to lords and rich men. There is 
no authority among them save the authority they give their leaders. A pirate crew is more of 
a democracy, where each man has his say. Important decisions are made by a vote of all the 
pirates; the captain really has authority only in battle. Just as important as the captain is the 
quartermaster, who represents the crew’s needs to the captain, leads boarding actions and settles 
disputes. Officers are also elected to command parts of the crew in battle; most crews will have a 
gunner, a boatswain, a carpenter, a cook and a mate or two.

Of course, the size of a crew varies wildly. A small ship like a sloop might have only a dozen 
pirates  aboard  but  a  mighty  galleon  would  be  crewed  by  hundreds  of  rogues  –  and  a  pirate 
ship that big is no doubt accompanied by a consort vessel or three, making her captain a pirate 
admiral. 

Crew Quality

In Pirates of Legend, the quality of a crew counts for much. An experienced gang of dangerous 
pirates will obviously outfight or out sail a few green merchant seamen but would still turn tail 
and run when confronted by the best ship in the Royal Navy.

Crew  qualities  range  from  Atrocious  to  Peerless.  Each  crew  quality  has  a  percentile  value 
associated with it, which is the crew’s basic skill level. This is the average skill level of the crew 
when it comes to making a Skill Test for the whole ship. Individual sailors may have a skill that is 
far higher or lower than this average but crew Skill Tests are made for a whole crew.

Crew Quality
Atrocious (Landlubbers)
Very Poor (Green) 
Poor (Scurvy Dogs)
Average (Passing Fair)
Good (Sea Dogs)
Excellent (Devilish Cut-throats)
Fearsome (Most Notorious Pirates)
Peerless (Devils Straight From Hell)

While this base skill can be used for any Skill Test made by the crew, a few skills are obviously 
much more important for a piratical band. Skills like Shiphandling, Boating, Gunnery or throat-
cutting are of more use to a pirate crew than being able to dance or speak prettily. Having a good 
quartermaster leading a ship’s boarding party or a canny gunner in charge of the powder kegs 
can make all the difference in a battle. Therefore, a crew gets bonuses from having skilled officers 
in positions of authority. 

Choice Men and Reduced Crews
A crew’s quality is the average of the pirates’ skills. Now, some lazy sod or clumsy fool will drag 
that average down, just as an especially hardy sailor or iron-nerved cannoneer will bring the total 
up. In a given crew, then, it is possible to pick the best men and come up with a smaller crew of 
a higher average skill. On average, 10% of a crew will be one quality rank higher and 10% will 
be one quality rank lower. So, for a Poor crew, 10% will be Very Poor and 10% will be Average. 

It is possible, obviously, to improve a crew by taking the best sailors from other crews and getting 
rid of your own unskilled dogs. Pirates often raid the hardy crews of the Newfoundland fishing 
boats for new recruits.

1The Quartermaster may choose any one melee weapon to determine the bonus he gives the

2The Gunner may choose either his Pistols or Longarms skill to determine the bonus he gives 
the crew.

The  crew  skill  gets  a  bonus  equal  to  one-tenth  the  skill  total  of  the  appropriate  officer.  For 
example, if a Gunner has a Gunnery skill of 70%, then the crew gets a bonus of +7% to all Gunnery 
crew checks. A Poor crew has a base skill of 40%, plus 7% for the leadership provided by their good 
gunner, so they would have an effective Gunnery of 47%.

Pirate Flags
While the skull-and-crossbones is the traditional pirate flag, it was not the only flag used. Every 
captain had his own unique flag, a barbaric coat of arms that everyone will recognise. Pirate flags 
used a combination of symbols of death, like skulls, hourglasses, bloody swords and so on. A 
newly elected captain should choose the flag he will sail under. 

Crew Skill Tests
A crew Skill Test is made whenever the whole crew must act as one. They work in exactly the 
same way as a normal Skill Test – roll percentile dice and try to get under the crew’s skill total. 
For example, when firing a broadside of cannons, then the crew must make a Gunnery test.

The Games Master makes all crew tests for opposing crews. 

For Adventurer ships, if one of the Adventurers is an officer, then he may make crew tests for 
those skills in his officer’s purview. If not, then any player may make the test.

Crew Skill Tests and Hero Points: Hero Points can be spent to re-roll crew tests but it costs 
three Hero Points to re-roll such a test, not just one. Several Adventurers can join together to pay 
this Hero Point cost for a re-roll.

Morale
The other major factor in a crew is morale – how much stomach they have for a fight and how 
much belief they have in their captain and the course he has set. Morale is bolstered by victories 
and plunder, and sapped by defeat, dullness or adversity. Morale tests must often be made in 
battle.

Morale is rated in levels. A Crew’s morale can be Fanatic, Very High, High, Average, Shaken, 
Low or Mutinous. 

Morale is calculated at the start of a voyage, as follows:

Crew Quality
Atrocious 
Very Poor 
Poor 
Average
Good
Excellent
Fearsome 
Peerless

Base Morale
Low
Shaken
Shaken
Average
Average
High
High
Very High

Add the following factors to that base morale: 
•	
•	
•	

If the captain has a Charisma of 15 or higher, increase the crew’s morale by one level.
If the cook has a Cooking skill of 50% or higher, increase the crew’s morale by one level.
If the musician has a Perform skill of 50% or higher, increase the crew’s morale by one 
level.

38
Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

Morale is also recalculated if the captain is replaced. 

Morale will rise and fall very quickly during voyages. See Piracy, page 63, for more details on 
events at sea.

Morale Tests
Certain situations will call for a Morale test, which is made using the Crew’s Persistence score. If 
this test is failed, then the crew’s nerve has faltered and they lose one level of Morale. On a critical 
success, the crew is galvanised by the challenge and gains one level of Morale.

The Games Master makes all Morale tests.

Hero Points may be spent to re-roll Morale tests – it costs the Adventurers three Hero Points to 
get such a re-roll. 

Morale Bonuses
A crew gets a bonus to all Crew Tests based on its morale. This morale bonus can be a very useful 
edge in a fight between evenly matched crews.

Elections
An  Adventurer’s  Reputation  determines  how  much  influence  he  has  on  board  ship.  Most 
ordinary deck-hands will just follow the Adventurer with the highest Reputation, or who has 
won their trust. In any contest of influence on board ship, follow this procedure:

Step One
Start  by  determining  who  the  contenders  are.  For  example,  if  there  are  two  Adventurers  on 
board who hope to be quartermaster, then these two are the contenders. If the Adventurers are 
trying to convince the crew that the captain should be removed, then the captain and one of the 
Adventurers are the contenders.

Next, the positions of the rest of the crew must be considered. 

Step Two
Remove from consideration all members of the crew whose Reputation is less than half that of 
the highest Reputation on board ship. Effectively, this will remove all but the officers and other 
highly influential pirates on board. For example, if the captain has Reputation 16, then anyone 
with a Reputation of less than eight is simply irrelevant in terms of sway.

Going On The Account
To ‘go on the account’ means to become a pirate and join a pirate crew. The majority of pirates 
joined such crews voluntarily, hoping for little work but rich rewards, or they were running from 
something and had nowhere else to go. One may as well be hung for being a pirate as for being 
a murderer or a thief. Others were press-ganged into joining a pirate crew; when the merchant 
ship you serve on is taken as a prize and the choice is between joining the rogues and a knife in 
the gut, only the most principled man would not join the pirates.

Every pirate crew has its own articles that every man among them must sign to. One famous set 
of articles, used by the crew of Captain Roberts, ran as follows:

ARTICLE I. Every man shall have an equal vote in affairs of moment. He shall have an equal 
title to the fresh provisions or strong liquors at any time seized and shall use them at pleasure 
unless a scarcity may make it necessary for the common good that a retrenchment may be voted. 

ARTICLE II. Every man shall be called fairly in turn by the list on board of prizes, because over 
and above their proper share, they are allowed a shift of clothes. But if they defraud the company 
to the value of even one dollar in plate, jewels or money, they shall be marooned. If any man robs 
another he shall have his nose and ears slit and be put ashore where he shall be sure to encounter 
hardships. 

ARTICLE III. None shall game for money either with dice or cards. 

ARTICLE IV. The lights and candles should be put out at eight at night and if any of the crew 
desire to drink after that hour they shall sit upon the open deck without lights. 

ARTICLE V. Each man shall keep his piece, cutlass and pistols at all times clean and ready for 
action. 

ARTICLE VI.  No  boy  or  woman  to  be  allowed  amongst  them.  If  any  man  shall  be  found 
seducing any of the latter sex and carrying her to sea in disguise he shall suffer death. 

ARTICLE VII. He that shall desert the ship or his quarters in time of battle shall be punished 
by death or marooning. 

ARTICLE  VIII.  None  shall  strike  another  on  board  the  ship  but  every  man’s  quarrel  shall 
be  ended  on  shore  by  sword  or  pistol  in  this  manner.  At  the  word  of  command  from  the 
quartermaster, each man being previously placed back to back, shall turn and fire immediately. 
If any man does not, the quartermaster shall knock the piece out of his hand. If both miss their 
aim they shall take to their cutlasses, and he that draweth first blood shall be declared the victor. 

ARTICLE IX. No man shall talk of breaking up their way of living till each has a share of £l,000. 
Every man who shall become a cripple or lose a limb in the service shall have 800 pieces of eight 
from the common stock and for lesser hurts proportionately. 

ARTICLE X. The captain and the quartermaster shall each receive two shares of a prize, the 
master gunner and boatswain, one and one half shares, all other officers one and one quarter, and 
private gentlemen of fortune one share each. 

ARTICLE XI. The musicians shall have rest on the Sabbath Day only by right. On all other 
days by favour only. 

Every pirate ship will have its own articles, agreed upon and kept to by the crew.

Step Three
Of those crewmen remaining after step two, determine who each of them supports. Add half 
their Reputation scores, rounding down, to the Reputation score of the contender they support. 
This total score is referred to as an Adventurer’s Sway in the election.

Step Four
Finally, each contender rolls 1D10 and adds it to their score. The contender with the highest 
score wins the contest. In certain circumstances, a dramatic speech or other act to inspire loyalty, 
like bribery, can give the Adventurer a further bonus to Sway.

Captain of Shreds and Patches
The pirate ship Greywater has gone to the bottom, along with most of her crew. However, 12 
pirates managed to escape on board a battered boat and now they are arguing amongst themselves 
over who is in charge. Their Reputation scores are important for this contest, so here they are:

Pirate
Pete the Scoundrel
One-Eyed Joe
Mart Roberts
Alan Fairhands
French Lou
Rest of the pirates

Reputation
8
6
6
5
5
0–3

Pete  the  Scoundrel,  a  notorious  murderer,  and  One-Eyed  Joe  are  both  in  contention  to  be 
captain. As Pete has Reputation 8, anyone with Reputation 4 or less is irrelevant.

Next, it must be determined who the other pirates will support. While Pete is well known as a 
killer, few of the others trust him; therefore, Mart Roberts and French Lou support One-Eyed 
Joe, adding half their Reputation score to his. Alan Fairhands supports his old friend Pete.

Pete now has a total Sway of 8+2 = 10. One-Eyed Joe has a total score of 6+3+2 = 11. 

Finally, both Adventurers roll 1D10, and with the crew on a knife-edge like that, blind luck will 
make all the difference. One-Eyed Joe wins, and is elected Captain. 

Pete the Scoundrel smiles, and fingers his wickedly sharp knife. One-Eyed Joe, is it? Well, Joe, 
what you don’t see on your left side can still hurt you…

Some positions give a temporary Reputation bonus. This bonus is applied immediately.

Captains, Quartermasters and Officers
Holding a position of authority on board a ship gives an Adventurer more responsibilities and 
often puts him in a perilous situation but does also give him more influence among the crew 
and a greater share of the prize. Every pirate vessel will have a captain and a quartermaster at the 
very least. If a ship has guns, then it must have a master gunner; if it has boats, it must have a 
boatswain. 

Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

41

Each  officer’s  position  gives  extra  shares  of  booty.  It  may  also  give  a  temporary  bonus  to 
Reputation, if the Adventurer fulfils certain requirements. If these requirements are not met, 
then the bonus becomes a penalty – a good cook wins the crew’s love but a bad cook causes 
grumbling and dissent. 

An officer also gives a bonus to certain crew skill tests, equal to one-fifth the officer’s skill in that 
category.

Captain: Commands the ship in battle; orders its course; leads the crew (note that becoming a 
captain gives a permanent +4 bonus to Reputation as well as a temporary one – see the Reputation 
table on page 92). The captain gives a bonus to the crew’s Shiphandling, Persistence and Morale. 

Quartermaster: Resolves disputes, shares out plunder, leads boarding actions. The quartermaster 
gives a bonus to all Hand to Hand attacks and to Resilience. 

Boatswain: Commands the ship’s boats; second in command in boarding actions. The boatswain 
gives a bonus to Boating.

Gunner: Commands the ship’s guns; keeps the armoury. The gunner gives a bonus to Gunnery 
and Firearms.

Cook: Commands the ship’s stores. Gives a bonus to Morale.

Carpenter’s Mate: Commands repairs and supplies. Gives a bonus to Craft (Carpentry) used 
when repairing a ship.

Captain of Shreds & Patches, Part II.
To return to those unfortunates on that doomed little boat …

The 12 survivors of the Greywater are a poor crew but a crew nonetheless, so they shall serve as 
an example both of the rules for crews and of the folly of evil men. Their Crew Quality is Poor, 
so they have a Base Crew Skill of 40%.

One-Eyed Joe is their Captain; they elect Mart Roberts as Quartermaster and Alan Fairhands as 
Boatswain. Without cannons, there is no need for a Gunner and none of them have the skills to 
take on any other office.

Improvement
Crews  gain  Improvement  rolls  just  like  Adventurers  but  a  crew  gains  Improvement  rolls 
more rarely – on average, a crew gets one roll per story. Crews use Improvement rolls just like 
Adventurers to improve their skills. 

A crew Improvement roll may also be spent to increase Morale by one level. 

Mutinies
If a crew’s Morale is reduced to Mutinous, then they are prepared to turn on their captain. Roll 
1D6 on the following list to determine the crew’s reaction:

1. Demand an election.
2. The highest reputation officer challenges the captain to a duel. If no-one dares challenge him, 
roll again.
3. A conspiracy of officers overthrows the captain and chooses one of their own to lead.
4. Wait until another ship is captured, then take that as their own ship.
5. The crew quarrel among themselves, leading to bloody slaughter on the deck.
6. Strand the captain on an island or boat, and hold an election. 

Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

43

Especially intimidating captains can fend off a mutiny for some time. When a crew chooses to 
mutiny, roll against the captain’s Reputation. If the result is lower, then the crew are too scared to 
rebel for the moment and will defer their mutiny under the next opportunity, giving the captain 
a chance to rebuild morale. 

Raising Morale
There are several ways to raise morale:
•	

Taking a prize: If the pirates capture a ship without significant losses, they gain one level 
of Morale.
Taking a rich prize: Capturing a ship with a Treasure or Rich Cargo on board also gives 
one level of Morale.
Getting drunk: Allowing a crew to get properly drunk, or spending time at a port, gives 
1D3 levels of morale. A drunken crew suffers a penalty to all Crew tests.

•	

•	

Battle Stations
In a battle, there are three main tasks – sailing the ship, manning the guns and actually fighting 
with musket or cutlass. These three crews are handled separately in a battle – see page 63 for 
more details on crews in battles.

Healing Damage To A Crew
Each week, the crew should make a Resilience test to see how many of the crew are restored to 
health.

from the common stores. The amount payable to the crippled man depends on the wound he 
suffered in action:

ships and the sea

In  the  Golden  Age  of  Piracy,  the  largest  ships  belong  to  the  navies  of  the  great  powers,  like 
England, France and Spain. These warships are rated by the number of guns. Mighty First-Rate 
vessels are more like fortresses than ships and are never seen in the Caribbean. Second- and Third-
Rates are almost as rare and even a Fourth-Rate vessel is more than a match for any pirate vessel. 
Most Naval pirate hunting is done by smaller ships, called frigates. Such ships carry around 20 or 
30 cannons and around 100 souls on board. 

Frigates barely count as Ships of the Line and are used mainly as couriers and scouts in wartime. 
Corvettes are even smaller than frigates and are used as escorts and scouts too. 

Pirates tend to sail in armed merchant ships. Sloops are fast and tough, able to take full advantage 
of the wind with sails mounted from both the mast and bowsprit. Schooners tend to be a little 
larger  than  sloops  but  have  a  lesser  draft  and  two  masts.  As  they  are  able  to  enter  shallower 
waters, they are especially favoured by smugglers. Finally, brigantines are two-masted ships that 
often carry oars as well as sails; the design was originally so favoured by thieves that the very name 
means ‘brigand’s ship’. Towards the end of the Age of Piracy, the word came to refer mainly to 
a style of rigging. Barques are three-masted ships, capable of longer voyages than other vessels.

While both pirates and merchants use sloops, schooners and brigantines, there are other designs 
of ship that no sensible pirate would use if he could avoid it. Indiamen are huge cargo vessels, 
the backbone of trade between the West Indies and Europe. Snows are another type of trader, 
popular in the North Atlantic. Fluyts are another common design.

Spanish galleons are a rare sight in this era but there are still treasure ships bringing the wealth 
of the South American mines back to Spain. There are also innumerable smaller vessels on the 
seas, from canoes and rowboats and ship’s boats (also called pinnaces) to fishing boats and barges. 

The ships described here are average models but there was a wide variation between different 
types of ship. The defining quality of a ship was often not its size but its rigging and hull design. 
A ship can be up to 50% bigger or smaller than the averages listed, with a commensurate change 
in Structural Points and guns. 

Ship Statistics
Length: The distance from bow to stern. 

Draft: The  depth  of  water  needed  for  the  ship  to  manoeuvre  effectively  and  avoid  running 
aground. This is the distance between the ship’s keel and the waterline.

Your Starting Ship
It is assumed that most pirate games will begin with the Adventurers being part of the crew of 
a sloop – the smallest vessel commonly used by pirates. Roll on the Ship Traits table for more 
details of the sloop.

Capacity: This indicates the cargo capacity of the ship in tons. This number reflects the ship’s 
cargo capacity in addition to the weight of the ship’s rigging, crew, provisions and so forth.
Speed: For rowed vessels, then this lists the speed at which the vessel travels per Crew Combat 
Round  (30  seconds,  or  six  normal  rounds)  or  per  12  hour  period.  For  sailed  vessels,  then  a 
modifier is listed, describing how much faster or slower than average the vessel goes.

Seaworthiness: The  ability  of  the  ship  to  stand  up  to  the  rigours  of  sailing.  All  ships  must 
undergo frequent maintenance in order to keep their Seaworthiness rating from deteriorating.

Structure Points: Essentially, Structure Points are a ship’s Hit Points. Damage to these represents 
damage to the integrity of the ship itself and ships do not heal of their own accord. 

Weapons: The weapons carried on the ship.

Crew: The first number is the minimum needed to sail the ship without penalty. The second 
number is the average crew on board such a ship and the last number is the maximum number 
of people that the ship can reasonably carry. 

A vessel can be sailed with as little as one-third the minimum crew – this is called a skeleton 
crew. More commonly, a captured vessel is given a two-thirds minimum crew, called a prize crew.

Skill: Every ship has its own peculiarities and each design presents different challenges. This 
entry firstly denotes which skill is used when operating the ship (nearly always either Boating 
or Shiphandling). Also, though any ship can be operated under ideal conditions without the 
necessity of a Skill Test, when the ship and crew are called upon for more extreme endeavours, 
this modifier is applied to the Skill Test. Note that this modifier is in addition to any others the 
Games Master feels are appropriate.

Overloading
If  a  ship  is  carrying  more  than  three-quarters  of  its  maximum  cargo  capacity,  then  its  draft 
increases by 25% and it suffers a –10% penalty to Shiphandling tests.

Crew Size & Crew Tests
A skeleton crew suffers a –20% penalty to all Shiphandling and other crew tests.

A prize crew suffers a –10% penalty to all Shiphandling and other crew tests. 

An over-crewed ship gets a +10% bonus to all Shiphandling and other appropriate crew tests.

Changes from the Legend Ship Rules
The ship rules in Pirates of Legend are based on those in the Legend Core Rulebook but have a few key 
differences to reflect different priorities and the different settings. Legend assumes a fantasy-medieval 
setting, with ships that are quite different from the sloops and schooners of the Spanish Main.
•	 Measurements are in Imperial, not Metric: Having pirates measure speed in kilometres 
instead  of  knots,  or  talk  about  a  ship  being  so  many  metres  long  just  seems  wrong,  so 
imperial measurements are used. (‘Avast, ye dogs, and fire the 16-kilo cannons!’)
Speed works slightly differently: There is a bigger emphasis on sailing speed and wind in 
Pirates of Legend, so a sailed ship’s speed is measured as a bonus or penalty.

Movement
Rowing
Each vessel capable of movement by rowing or poling has a Speed entry in its description. This is 
the ship’s base Movement in normal operating conditions. Rowing a vessel at this normal speed 
counts as medium activity for determining Fatigue.

The vessel can be slowed to half speed, which counts only as light activity for the rowers to 
maintain. The speed of the vessel can also be doubled, a gruelling activity that counts as heavy 
activity for the rowers.

If the vessel is operating against a fresh gale or heavier wind, the level of activity is increased by 
one step. Thus moving at half speed counts as medium activity, moving at normal speed counts 
as heavy activity and the vessel cannot move at double speed.

That said, if the vessel is operating before a fresh gale or heavier wind, the level of activity is 
decreased  by  one  step. Thus  moving  at  normal  speed  counts  as  light  activity  and  moving  at 
double speed counts as medium activity.

52

Wind Speed: The speed of the prevailing winds.

Against: The vessel is moving against or perpendicular to the direction of the wind.

Before: The vessel is moving with the prevailing winds.

Skill Modifier: The modifier to the Boating skill imposed by the winds. This modifier is in 
addition to the modifiers of the ship itself and any others the Games Master feels are appropriate.

Sailing

Sails offer some significant advantages over rowing. A sailing ship requires a much smaller crew, 
for example, and the ship relies on wind, rather than broad backs, for its propulsion.

The speed of a sailing ship depends upon the angle of the wind in relation to the ship, as well 
as  the  speed  of  the  wind  itself.  For  the  sake  of  simplicity,  these  rules  incorporate  four  wind 
directions: before the wind, quarter wind, half wind and head wind.

Before the Wind: The wind is coming directly from the stern of the ship toward the bow.

Quarter Wind: The wind is blowing against one of the ship’s rear quarters, at a roughly 45 
degree angle to the length of the ship.

Half Wind: The wind is blowing across the ship, at a roughly 90 degree angle to the length of 
the ship.

Head Wind: The wind is blowing directly from the bow of the ship toward the stern.

The Sailing Speed table gives the speed a sailing ship will travel under different wind speeds, 
presented in the following manner: Speed per Crew Combat Round / Speed per 12 hour period.

*The winds of a full gale or a hurricane will shred a ship’s rigging. In such a situation, the best 
that can be done is to deploy a small amount of sailcloth to keep the ship steady and hope to ride 
out the storm. Alternatively, the truly reckless or desperate may press onward, at the same speed 
as a fresh gale but with double the normal skill penalty.

The rules assume all sailing ships travel at roughly the same speed, the heavier ships using more 
sails to offset their weight. In the event of one ship chasing another, the outcome of the race will 
depend upon the Boating or Shiphandling skills of the captains of either ship, and on the ship’s 
design and rigging.

Buying a Ship
Large ships are rarely for sale – virtually every pirate ship was stolen, or became a pirate ship when 
the crew decided to go on the account. Still, especially wealthy pirates may wish to purchase a 
vessel, or to sell a prize. In the extremely unlikely event that an Adventurer finds a buyer or seller, 
the following prices should be used as guidelines:

Customising and Changing a Ship

Ships can also be modified to serve other purposes or to emphasise a particular quality. Some 
modifications require the ship to be in a port or dock, or hauled up onto a beach. 

Modifications
Some of these changes require the ship to be beached or docked but others can be undertaken at 
sea, albeit with a penalty to Handiwork of –20%. Particularly difficult tasks also incur a bigger 
penalty  to  the  crew’s  Handiwork  test.  Each  modification  also  consumes  a  certain  amount  of 
supplies. 

If the Handiwork test fails, then the modification has gone wrong – either the task is impossible, 
or else an accident has occurred, smashing whatever items are being used and injuring 1D6 crew. 

Aft Guns
This adds a cannon to the rear of the ship, which can be fired when the vessel is being pursued.
Requires: Whatever guns are being added, 1D4 days.
Consumes: 1 ton of supplies per gun
Handiwork Modifier: Varies
The difficulty of the Handiwork test varies depending on the size of the gun and how many aft 
guns the ship already has.

Bulwarks
Heavy wooden bulwarks and defensive fortifications can be added to a ship’s deck, to give extra 
protection against attack by muskets and small arms fire. Adding Bulwarks gives a –10% penalty 
to all Shiphandling tests. A ship with Bulwarks counts as having a +2 Hull for the purposes of 
protecting the crew against small arms fire. 
Requires: 1D6 weeks
Consumes: 1 ton of supplies per ten feet length of the ship
Handiwork Modifier: +0%

Copper Bottom
In the warm waters of the Caribbean, a ship can quickly become fouled with teredo beetles, 
barnacles, weeds and other growths and parasites that slow its speed. Adding copper plates to the 
underwater sections of the hull prevents the needs for careering. 
Requires: Drydock, 3D6 weeks
Consumes: Copper plates, costing 100 silver per ton of capacity of the ship
Handiwork Modifier: +0%

56
Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

Chase Guns
Adding chase guns, on the front of the ship, works just like adding aft guns, with one important 
difference – the narrow prow of the ship has less space for extra armament, so the penalty to 
Handiwork tests is increased by +20%.

Full Repairs
Full repairs restores 2D6 Structural Points or 1D6 points of Seaworthiness per ton of supplies used. 
Requires: 1 day
Consumes: Up to five tons of supplies 
Handiwork Modifier: +0%

Hidden Cargo Space 
This modification creates a hidden compartment in the ship’s hold, where cargo can be hidden. 
It is often used by smugglers. Finding such a hidden space requires a Perception test opposed by 
the builder’s Handiwork. 
Requires: 1D6 days
Consumes: One ton of supplies per ton of hiding space.
Handiwork Modifier: –20% if done at sea

Lighten Hull
By removing two cannon, 10% of the ship’s cargo space, or by reducing Structural Points by 5%, 
the crew make the ship lighter, reducing its draft by one foot and increasing its speed by 6ft/1 
knot. This modification can be attempted multiple times but each time, the Handiwork test 
penalty doubles. This modification cannot be attempted if it would reduce the ship’s draft to 0.
Requires: 1D6 days
Consumes: 1D6 tones of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: –10%

More Cannon
Adding more cannons to a ship can be done but there are two major restrictions. Firstly, heavy cannon 
will slow the ship down. Secondly, the extra recoil may damage the ship, or even cause it to capsize. 

For every eight 9-pounders, four 18-pounders, two 24-pounders or single 45-pounder added, 
then reduce the ship’s Movement by 3 ft/ ½ knot. 

If the guns mounted are larger than normal, then a second Handiwork test must be made the 
first time the guns are fired. If this test fails, then the gun breaks free of its housing and deals 2D6 
points of Structural Damage to the ship. The ship also loses 1D4 Seaworthiness.

Requires: Extra cannon, 1D4 days 
Consumes: 1 ton of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: Varies

More Cargo Space
By removing internal frames and cabin space, the crew allow the ship to cram in more cargo. The 
ship’s Structure Points are decreased by 5% to increase its capacity by an equal amount. A ship 
can add no more than 25% to its starting capacity.
Requires: One day.
Consumes: 1 ton of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: –10%

More Sail
By adding more spars or even an extra mast, the crew attempt to increase the base speed of the 
vessel. The capacity of the ship is reduced by 10% or it suffers a –10% penalty to all Shiphandling 
tests but its speed is increased by 6 ft/1 knot. 
Requires: 1D6 days. 
Consumes: 2D6 tons of supplies
Handiwork Modifier: –10%

Reinforced Hull
By fortifying the ship for combat, even a merchant vessel can be made into a warship. The ship’s 
Hull rating is increased by 1 and its Structure Point total is increased by 20%.
Requires: 3D6 weeks.
Consumes: One ton of supplies per five Structure Points. 
Handiwork Modifier: –10%

Temporary Measures
Bail Out The Bilges
A crew can temporarily raise the Seaworthiness of a ship by 1D4 points by frantically fixing leaks 
and bailing out floodwaters. This must be repeated every day to keep the bonus points in place.

Repair

One thing is certain about a ship – it will always be in need of repair. Ships lose Seaworthiness as 
part of their normal operation, wear and tear that must be attended to eventually. In addition to 
this is the damage to a ship’s Structure Points that occur through combat.

Cost of Repair
A ship requires 10 silvers worth of materials to repair every lost point of Seaworthiness. Repairing 
lost Structure Points requires 100 silvers worth of materials for every point.

Repair Crews
Ship repair crews work in exactly the same manner as construction crews and cost the same. A 
standard repair crew can repair 10 points of Seaworthiness or four Structure Points per day on a 
beached or dry docked ship.

If he is working alone, a ship’s carpenter can repair three points of Seaworthiness or one Structure 
Point per day on a beached or dry docked ship.

Repairs at Sea
While at sea, any Handiwork skill tests suffer a –40% penalty.

When attempting to repair a ship at sea, the carpenter must attempt a Handiwork Skill Test 
every 12 hours. Success indicates he has repaired one lost point of Seaworthiness or one Structure 
Point.  This  can  be  increased  by  an  additional  +1D4  points  if  there  are  sufficient  crewmen 
available to form a work squad.

If the ship’s carpenter fails his Handicraft Skill Test, no repairs are made but the supplies used in 
the attempt are still consumed.

Vessel Damage

A ship can meet its end in one of two ways. A ship that loses all its Seaworthiness points will 
begin taking on water at a rate faster than the water can be expelled, causing it to sink. A ship 
may also be destroyed through the loss of all its Structure Points as a result of damage from 
weather and enemies.

Seaworthiness
All ships are fashioned from timber and nails, and all of them continually take on water. The 
question is exactly how much water. Bailing water from a ship’s bilge is a normal part of a sailor’s 
daily  duties  and  larger  ships  always  carry  at  least  one  carpenter  (and  spare  lumber)  to  make 
emergency repairs when needed.

So long as a ship has at least one Seaworthiness point remaining, the water comes into the ship 
at a slower rate than it is expelled by the actions of the crew. Once the ship’s Seaworthiness falls 
to zero, its day is done. The vessel will begin to swamp, a process that takes one Crew Combat 
Round for every 30 feet of the ship’s length. When a ship is fully swamped, it will sink.

Every time a ship suffers 10 or more points of structural damage from a single attack, reduce the 
Seaworthiness of the ship by one point.

Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

59

Structure Points
If a ship’s Structure Points are ever reduced to zero, the ship immediately begins to break apart. 
What remains is useful only as life rafts for the surviving crew.

Dangers

The sea is a dangerous place to be. Even without the potential dangers of enemy ships and rival 
pirates, threats such as storms and fires can imperil a ship.

Disease
Bad food, fetid conditions below decks and tropical heat conspire to make fever a danger on 
board  ship.  Some  ports  are  also  especially  dangerous.  If  a  disease  breaks  out  on  board  ship, 
then the crew must make a Resilience test. If this test fails, then 1D6 x 5% of the crew fall ill 
initially. Each week, another Resilience test should be made. If this test fails, then the number 
infected rises by 10% and 10% of those already infected fall dead. If the test is successful, then 
the number infected falls by 10% and only 5% of those infected die. 

If a ship has a doctor on board, then the doctor may make a Healing test. If this test is successful, 
then the crew gets a +20% bonus to its Resilience test. 

Fire
Small fires are very common aboard ships, although they are always carefully contained. A fire 
that escapes control is, however, a real danger to a ship. If not extinguished, an uncontrolled fire 
aboard a ship will grow one size category every 2D6 minutes.

Every Combat Round during which the fire rages, the Games Master should roll damage dice 
and apply the damage directly to the ship’s Structure Points.

Storms
The most terrible danger facing a ship at sea is the weather. The wind and the sea combine to 
strike at the tossing ship with a primal fury, as masts creak and crack in the gale, leaks spray water 
into the hold and cargo bursts its ties to tumble about the storm-wracked deck.

For a ship to survive a storm intact, the captain must employ his Shiphandling skill (or Boating 
skill if necessary) to keep the vessel steady and turned into the storm. If the Skill Test is successful, 
the ship endures one hour of storm weather at a cost of only one Seaworthiness. If the Skill Test 
fails, the ship endures one hour of storm weather at a cost 1D6 Seaworthiness.

Running Aground
Reefs and sandbars spell the doom for more ships than any pirate. If an unexpected reef lies 
ahead on the ship’s course, then the lookout is permitted a Perception test to notice the reef and 
then the helmsman may make a Shiphandling test to avoid it. If this fails, then the ship risks 
running around. Roll 1D6 x (1D6–2) for the depth of the reef below the water (if the result is 
negative, then the reef actually pokes above the surface.) The ship takes 1D4 points of Structural 
Damage and loses an equal amount of Seaworthiness for every foot of the ship’s draft that strikes 
the reef. For example, if a ship with a draft of 15 feet runs into a reef that is 10 feet below the 
surface, then it takes 5D4 damage. If the ship is still seaworthy, then it can possibly be floated off 
the reef at high tide by lightening it. 

Beaching a Ship
Beaching a ship is normally only done in the most dire circumstances. Canoes, rowboats and 
rafts can be beached with impunity, though even they have a 25% chance of losing a point of 
Seaworthiness when they do so.

Beaching other ships requires the crew to make a Shiphandling test with a penalty of between 0% 
and 100%, depending on the suitability of the beach and the time taken. If the ship is carefully 
sailed into shallow waters, then slowly rolled onto its side by moving the cannons and other 
weights, then the penalty is lessened. Sailing onto the shore in the teeth of a fierce storm incurs 
a much bigger penalty. Success on this test merely results in the ship losing 1D6 Seaworthiness 
and 1D6 Structure Points. Failure results in the ship losing its draft x D10 (minimum of 1D10) 
in both Seaworthiness and structure points, as the ship effectively crashes into the shore.

Careening
The warm waters of the Caribbean are a paradise for weeds, worms and other parasites, and a 
ship will quickly find itself befouled by all manner of things clinging to its lower hull. These 
weeds create drag, slowing a ship down considerably. A wise pirate, therefore, will careen his 
vessel regularly, to keep it moving swiftly and smoothly through the ocean.
 
Each week of sailing, roll 1D6. On a 6, then the ship’s speed drops by 6 ft/1 knot until it is 
careened.

To careen a ship, it must be beached or put into a dock. The crew then scrape the bottom clear 
of  debris. This  takes  1D3  days  and  a  successful  Handiwork  test.  Each  successful  attempt  at 
careening brings the ship’s speed back up by 6 ft/1 knot.

piracy and plunder

This chapter has a great number of random tables, which the Games Master can use for random 
encounters and prizes. If the Adventurers just want to sail around the Caribbean stealing ships, 
then you need look no further!

These random encounters should be used to fill the gaps between pre-planned episodes, or to 
give ideas for new adventures. Even a minor prize like a sloop could contain some surprising 
revelation – for example, if one of the passengers on the sloop is a Spanish official and he knows 
that a galleon loaded with treasure has put into a lightly-defended harbour in Tobago. Suddenly, 
the pirates have a target to aim for…

Encounters At Sea

The following series of tables allow the Games Master to determine randomly what sort of ships 
or events the Adventurers encounter at sea. One roll should be made each day at sea. Choose the 
appropriate column for the ship’s current location.

The possible locations are:
Near Port: Roll on this column if the ship is within a few hour’s sail of a major port.
Settled Coast: Roll on this column if the ship is near an island or mainland that has been settled 
by one of the great powers. 
Wild Coast: For unexplored, uncharted or just unsettled regions.
Open Seas: Roll on this column if the ship is at sea in an unremarkable area of the Caribbean.
Trade Route: Roll on this column if the ship is at sea along one of the major trade routes.
Backwater: Roll on this column if the ship is at sea in a little-travelled or unexplored region.
High Seas: Roll on this column if the ship is at sea on the open ocean between the Old World 
and the New.

A Note on Random Tables
There is an infamous story told in an old Dragon magazine about a space-faring game. The players 
showed up and spent a few hours rolling up their characters and their brand new ship. They 
are all excited and enthused about the idea of playing space-travelling traders and adventurers. 
Finally, the game kicks off. Their ship leaves the space station and jumps into hyperspace. Their 
navigator rolls his Hyperspace Navigation skill and passes with ease.

However, in the system they were using, there is a tiny chance that a jump will go wrong anyway 
and it does. They randomly hit an asteroid as they fly. The Games Master rolls the size of the 
asteroid  (a  small  moon),  the  location  hit  (main  reactor)  and  the  result  (everyone  dies).  So,  by 
hewing too closely to the random results, the Games Master killed off all the characters at the 
very start of the campaign.

What’s the moral of the story? It’s not that random tables are bad – they are a very useful tool 
for simulating the vagaries of life, which works well for some styles of gaming. No, it is that the 
Games Master is in charge, not the tables, and he should always make the game exciting. To take 
a similar situation, it is possible for the Adventurers’ ship to run aground on a sandbar and sink 
on their very first day as pirates. If the Games Master rolls that result, then he should ask himself 
what would serve the game best. Perhaps he should just reroll? Or maybe the Adventurers do lose 
their ship and the game turns into a bitter struggle for survival as the Adventurers and the other 
pirates find themselves on a deserted atoll. Or perhaps a merchant vessel picks the Adventurers 
up as their ship sinks and they need to pretend they are honest sailors until they can take over the 
merchantman and refit it as their new pirate ship.

Why Have Random Encounters At All?
It could be argued that random encounters are an anachronism in role-playing games. Instead 
of rolling on all these endless tables to determine the encounter, why should the Games Master 
not just choose what the Adventurers encounter? Why have a random encounter that contributes 
nothing to the overall story?

While a Games Master can certainly choose an encounter instead of rolling it randomly, random 
rolls can be fun! Players like rolling dice and the thrill of randomly happening upon an especially 
rich or dangerous prize is all the greater because blind fate dictated it, instead of the Games 
Master choosing it.

As  for  random  encounters  not  contributing  to  the  overall  story,  that  is  not  strictly  true.  By 
their  very  nature,  role-playing  games  have  to  be  ‘looser’  than  movies  or  novels. With  several 
protagonists (the Adventurers) and no central authority on events, it is difficult for a roleplaying 
game to have both the rising actions and reversals needed for a good story, and the character 
development and exploration desired by players. Random and throw-away encounters give the 
interactive story time to breathe.

Plunder
Provisions: These are basic foodstuffs, such as fresh water, beer, bread, salt meat, hardtack and so 
forth – just what a ship’s crew needs to eat. Provisions are used on a voyage, not traded.

Supplies: Rope, sails, nails, pitch, timber and other materials needed to repair a ship.

Ammo: Powder and shot for cannons.

Common Plunder: A ship carries a wide variety of goods. For each die or value listed, roll on 
the Common Plunder table. For example, if a ship’s Plunder is listed as 2x2D10 Common, you 
would roll twice on the Common Plunder table. There would be 2D10 tons of the first result on 
board and 2D10 tons of the second result.

combat on the high seas

This chapter covers maiming, brutality, sword-fights, boarding actions, ship-to-ship battles and 
exactly what happens when a cannon explodes in your face.

The standard Legend rules serve admirably for most fights in a pirate game. For bloody struggles 
between  a  band  of  pirates  and  an  unfortunate  crew,  or  a  running  skirmish  between  escaped 
prisoners and the naval officers trying to recapture them, the rules are used without modification. 
There are two situations, however, where more detailed rules are needed for personal combat. 
These are Duels and Crew Combat.

A Duel is a fight between a small number of Adventurers (usually only two) which the Games 
Master wishes to lavish more detail on than the average fight. A Duel might be a literal duel with 
rapiers, a fistfight, or a desperate battle on a sinking ship. 

By contrast, a Crew Combat is a boarding action, a mutiny, or a battle on land involving a dozen 
or more fighters on either side, where the normal rules for combat would take too long. 

Duels

A Duel works just like a normal Legend melee combat, with the added complexity of Advantage. 
Advantage is a measure of how much one combatant is controlling the movement and tempo 
of the fight. Only one Adventurer in a fight can hold the Advantage at any given moment – 
that Adventurer is said to be Favoured in the fight. If the opponent does something to gain 
Advantage,  then  subtract  the  Advantage  gained  from  the  Favoured  Adventurer’s  total.  If  this 
would reduce the Favoured Adventurer’s Advantage to a negative number, then the opponent 
becomes Favoured instead, with a positive Advantage total equal to the excess gain.

For example, the pirates Bartholomew and Morgan are fighting a duel. Bartholomew made several 
successful attacks, and now has an Advantage of +3. As Bartholomew has the advantage, he is the 
Favoured  combatant.  Morgan  executes  a  particularly  clever  riposte  that  garners  him  6  points  of 
Advantage. He subtracts this from Bartholomew’s total, bringing it down to 0. The remaining three 
points go into a new Advantage for Matthew. 

The easiest way to keep track of Advantage is by putting a 10 sided die between the combatants. 
Move it closer to whatever Adventurer is currently favoured. When the Favoured Adventurer 
gains more Advantage, he increases the number shown on the die; when the opponent gains 
Advantage,  he  decreases  the  number  on  the  die,  or  moves  it  over  to  his  side  if  he  becomes 
Favoured.

Optional Rule: Fighting Aboard Ship
On a small vessel like a sloop, there is hardly enough room to take two paces without having to 
step over a coiled rope, hatchway, chest or other obstacle. There is little space to swing a sword 
in a fight. Therefore, most weapons suffer a penalty of –10% to hit in cramped conditions such 
as the deck of a ship. 

An Adventurer who does not care about slicing through lines can ignore this penalty but if he 
fails an attack roll by more than 20%, then his weapon has gotten caught on some obstacle and 
he is disarmed. 

Weapons such as axes, cutlasses and daggers are therefore better than rapiers or polearms on 
board ship. Weapons suitable for use in cramped conditions are listed on page 29.

Some conditions, such as the lower decks of a ship or a cave, are so cramped that anything larger 
than a knife suffers a penalty. 

Gaining Advantage
There are several ways to increase or decrease an Advantage score:

•	

•	

•	

Opposed  Rolls:  An  Adventurer  gains  one  point  of  Advantage  whenever  he  beats  an 
opponent’s score by more than 20% in an opposed roll. In melee combat, where attack 
rolls are opposed by Parry or Dodge, then advantage will flow back and forth quickly.
Successful Hits: Instead of dealing damage on a successful hit, an Adventurer can instead 
choose to gain 1D6 points of Advantage.
Hero Points: An Adventurer may spend a Hero Point to gain 1D6 points of Advantage.

Witty Repartee
Optionally, in Cinematic games, an Adventurer in a Duel can gain Advantage through witty 
repartee. Once per round, an Adventurer may insult or bait his opponent. If the opponent cannot 
respond wittily to this opening gambit, then the character gains +1 Advantage. If the opponent 
does respond, then the opponent gains +1 Advantage unless the Adventurer also responds in 
kind. The Adventurers keep trading insults until either one Adventurer cannot respond wittily.

The Games Master (in a duel between two Adventurers) or the other players (in a duel between 
an  Adventurer  and  a  Non-Player  Characters)  are  the  audience,  and  should  laugh  or  groan 
appropriately. If a line elicits no response, then it has failed. 

Optionally, a player can make an Influence check to get a suggestion from the other players, if he 
is stuck and cannot come up with a good line.

Using Advantage
There are several distinct advantages, so to speak, to having the Advantage in a fight. There are 
two ‘passive’ bonuses that apply all the time, as long as an Adventurer is favoured:

•	 Bonus  to  Attack  rolls:  An Adventurer gains a +10% bonus to all his attacks for every 5 
points of Advantage he holds, or portion thereof. So, an Adventurer with even a single point 
of Advantage gets a +10% bonus; an Adventurer with +11 Advantage gets a massive +30% 
bonus to hit.

•	 Bonus to Parries: An Adventurer gains a +5% bonus to all his parries for every 5 points 
of  Advantage  he  holds,  or  portion  thereof.  So,  an  Adventurer  with  even  a  single  point  of 
Advantage gets a +5% bonus; an Adventurer with +11 Advantage gets a +15% bonus to parry.
 

Advantage can also be spent as part of an attack in several ways. 

•	

Force Movement: If an Adventurer is in melee with a foe, he can force his foe to move by 
spending Advantage. The Adventurer spends one point of Advantage per metre he wishes 
to move and both foes must move back or forth as the Adventurer chooses. If the opponent 
does not wish to move, then the Adventurer gets a Reaction free attack, and the opponent’s 
Evade score is penalised by 50%. Using this move, an Adventurer can force an opponent 
back over a cliff, into a cramped area, or into a burning building.

•	 Bonus Damage: An Adventurer can increase damage from a successful hit by spending 
Advantage. Each point of Advantage spent increases damage by +1. The Advantage must 
be spent after the attack is deemed to be successful but before the damage dice are rolled. 

Resetting Advantage
There are several ways an Adventurer who is losing a fight can ‘reset’ the Advantage back to 0, so 
that no Adventurer is favoured.

•	 Breaking Off: If neither combatant in a fight makes an attack roll in a round, then the 

Advantage resets to 0.

•	 Changing The Nature Of The Fight: A switch from melee to grappling, or from armed 

melee to unarmed melee resets the Advantage to 0.

•	 Blinding,  distracting  or  otherwise  stunning  the  opponent:  Such  an  event  resets  the 

Advantage to 0.

Reversing Advantage
If the Adventurer who is not favoured gets a critical result in an opposed roll, and the favoured 
Adventurer fails, then the Advantage is immediately reversed and the unfavoured Adventurer 
becomes favoured. 

Duels with Multiple Participants
While the Duel rules are intended to be used to model fights where two Adventurers vie for 
victory, they can be extended to larger fights. If there are multiple combatants on each side, say 
a two against two or three versus three battle, then the rules are used as normal, except that the 
passive bonuses to Parries and Attacks are not used.

Optional Rule: Fatigue in Pirates Games
The Legend  rules  for  Fatigue  rarely  come  into  play,  because  normal  combat  is  only  Medium 
activity, so Adventurers can keep fighting for a number of minutes equal to their CON without 
risking becoming Fatigued. While this rule supports the dungeon crawling or heroic questing 
of  fantasy  adventurers,  it  does  not  reflect  the  more  mortal  Adventurers  of  Pirates  of  Legend 
campaigns. 

It is suggested, then, that the following rules changes are made in Pirates of Legend games to 
fatigue:

•	 All combat counts as Heavy Activity. Therefore, an Adventurer can only fight for a number 

of rounds equal to his CON score before risking Fatigue. 

•	 Adventurers recover from fatigue slightly faster, as the following table shows:

Current State

Fresh
Winded
Wearied
Exhausted
Debilitated

To recover up to the next state takes…
Full Rest
—
One round
Five minutes
Four hours
Eight hours

Light Activity
—
One minute
One hour
—
—

 
Even if the change in the Fatigue rating of combat is not made for normal fights, it is strongly 
recommended that Duels count as Heavy activity.

Formal Duels

Formal duels are a gentleman’s way of settling disputes and matters of honour that cannot be 
addressed in any fashion save bloodshed. In a duel, the challenged party is permitted the pick 
of weapons – pistols or swords are normally chosen. Duels take place at a time agreed upon by 
both parties, although they never take place on the same night as the offence that provoked the 
quarrel. 

Each participant nominates a second, who watches for cheating. In a pistol duel, the seconds 
load the weapons; a second will also fight the duel if the challenger or challenged is incapacitated 
or sick. 

Duels normally go on until First Blood, which occurs when a location takes three or more points 
of damage. When a participant is wounded, then he should yield and give himself up to the 
mercy of the victor. 

Pirate Duels
Duels between pirates are never so formal, unless the participants are gentlemen of honour who 
have  somehow  fallen  into  piracy.  Pirate  duels  almost  never  take  place  on  board  a  ship  –  the 
brotherhood should be united when at sea, so disputes should be settled on the shore. Unlike a 

82
Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

formal duel, pirate duels tend to be to the death. Instead of a second, there is normally a ring of 
cheering and jeering pirates, out for the sight of blood. Some duels even involve the participants 
being bound together, or blindfolded, or take place on sandbars of sucking mud or on bare rocks 
with the tide rising swiftly.

Pistol Duels
In a pistol duel, both participants start back to back. They then take a predetermined number of 
steps apart, then turn and fire. The Adventurers roll their Strike Rank when they have taken the 
requisite number of steps. An Adventurer can cheat, turning and firing early. In such cases, the 
cheater gets a +1D6 bonus to his Strike Rank. 

When  firing,  both  Adventurers  get  a  +25%  bonus  to  their  Pistols  skill,  due  to  the  formal 
conditions and predictability of the opponent’s location. 

Duel Summary
•	 Only one side can have advantage at any time.
•	 Whenever you win a roll, you either gain +1 Advantage, or take –1 Advantage away from 

your opponent.

•	 Whoever has Advantage gains a bonus to attacks and parries.
•	 Advantage can also be spent to increase damage and perform other special attacks.
•	 Advantage is reversed if the currently disadvantaged party gets a critical success.
•	 Advantage can be reset to 0 by pausing or changing the nature of a fight.

Crew Combat

Crew  Combat  is  a  more  abstract  combat  system,  used  when  there  are  lots  of  combatants 
on either side, too many to bother keeping track of individually. The size of units in Crew 
Combat varies and should be set to a convenient value. For example, in a sea battle between 
two crews of 200 men, then splitting each crew into four 50-man groups would make sense. 
In a boarding action, when the pirates send a few 20-man boats across the water, then each 
boat might be a unit. 

Crew combat works in a similar way to normal combat, with the following changes:

•	 Crew combat rounds are 30 seconds long.
•	 There are no Strike Ranks. The attacking force goes first, followed by the defenders. If there 

is no clear attacking force, then both sides roll 1D10, highest goes first, re-rolling ties. 

•	 To make a Crew Combat attack, the leader of the crew (normally, the quartermaster or the 
gunner)  makes  a  check  against  the  appropriate  skill  (Firearms  or  Hand-To-Hand). This 
check may be modified by conditions. Hand to hand tests are opposed.

•	 Crew damage is not measured in hit points lost – instead, a unit may be Fresh, Wounded, 

Seriously Wounded, Mauled or Slaughtered. 

•	 At the end of a Crew Combat Round, one or both crews must make Morale tests.
•	 Adventurers can make Heroic Actions during Crew Combat, which inspire their companions 

and give bonuses to the result.

Crew Health, Crew Damage & Individual Adventurers
A  crew’s  health  is  measured  in  levels.  The  levels  are  Fresh  (unhurt),  Wounded,  Seriously 
Wounded, Mauled and Slaughtered. When a crew suffers an attack, it might drop down one 
or more health levels. Alternatively, it may also suffer a bonus to the next damage roll made 
against it – this models some of the crew being injured but not so many that the crew as a whole 
is affected. For example, if the result on a damage roll is ‘+3 to next damage roll’, then the next 
time in the battle that the crew is injured, then 3 is added to the roll.

Running Wounds Totals vanish when a crew actually takes damage. 

If a Slaughtered crew takes further damage, then it is removed from the battle (but most crews 
will break long before taking such punishment).

At  the  end  of  a  battle,  the  actual  damage  on  the  crew  is  determined.  A  crew  that  has  been 
Slaughtered may in fact have lost only a few sailors, or it could have been killed almost to a man. 
It is hard to tell, in the press and chaos of battle, who has been killed and who has merely been 
horribly maimed. See Aftermath, page 88.

For individual Adventurers in a battle the following table shows roughly what the various crew 
health levels translate to. However, this is only an average result – in a unit that just got reduced 
from Fresh to Wounded, there would be plenty of pirates who have not been injured at all and 
an unlucky fellow or two who are dead or maimed.

Severely Outnumbered Attackers & Ranged Attacks
No matter how good your crew’s shooting is, the amount of lead shot they can put into the air is 
limited by the number of guns they have. Therefore, in cases where a small handful of men are 
firing at a much larger group, a modifier is applied to their Ranged damage rolls.

Twice as many defenders as attackers: –1 to damage
Three times: –2 to damage
Four times: –3 to damage, and so forth.

So, if you are outnumbered five to one, you suffer a –4 penalty to your ranged attack damage 
rolls.

Cover & Fortifications
Cover also reduces the damage from Ranged attacks. 

Thick Vegetation: –1 damage
Light Cover (low walls, ship railings): –2 damage
Medium Cover (wooden buildings): –3 damage
Heavy Cover (stone fort): –4 damage

Ranged Attacks
Ranged Attack: To make a ranged attack on another crew, the crew makes a Firearms check, as 
modified by the Crew Combat Modifiers listed in the sidebar. 

A critical success gives a +6 bonus to the damage roll.

A Crew must make a Morale test whenever it takes a damage level – see Morale tests.

For example, a band of twenty pirates ambush a column of 40 guards and mine workers at a gold 
mine on the Spanish coast. The pirates are an Average crew, giving them a base Firearms score of 50%. 
They are lead by an experienced gunner and have good morale, increasing their score to 60%. 

The  pirates  ambush  the  enemy,  giving  them  a  +40%  bonus  to  their  attack,  and  fire  from  a  rise 
overlooking a trail through the jungle, giving them an extra +10%. Unsurprisingly, they hit with 
their opening barrage. 

They are outnumbered by the enemy, so they suffer a –1 penalty to their damage roll. The pirates roll 
an 11, –1 for a result of 10. This is a result of two damage levels, bringing the enemy down from Fresh 
to Seriously Wounded. The Spanish also have to make a Morale test.

The pirates fire again next round, as the Spanish struggle up the slope towards them. The pirates have 
lost the bonus for surprise, reducing their Firearms chance to hit to only 70% (60%, +10% for their 
good position). The firearms test fails, so the pirates roll on the Failed column of the damage table. 
They roll a 7, modified down by the fact they’re outnumbered to a 6. The result is that the next time 
the Spanish suffer damage, the roll on the damage table will be increased by +1.    

Of course, the pirates will not get a chance to fire again, as the Spanish are upon them and it’s  time 
to draw cutlasses!

Hand to Hand Attacks
Unlike Ranged Attacks, Hand to Hand attacks are opposed tests – both groups of combatants make 
a Hand to Hand test and the damage depends on which side won the test. If both succeed, then 
whoever rolled the highest or got a critical wins. If both fail, then whoever rolled the lowest wins. 

Hand to Hand attacks are modified as follows:

Attackers outnumber defenders

Attackers considerably outnumber defenders
Attackers vastly outnumber

to the Hand to Hand Damage table. Separate rolls are made for both sides.

To  continue  the  example  of  the  pirate  ambush,  the  Severely  Wounded  Spanish  reach  the  pirate 
ambushers on the hill. The Pirates have a Hand to Hand score of 55%; the Spanish have a score of 
40%.

Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

87

The pirates have no applicable modifiers to their Hand to Hand score.
The Spanish have several modifiers, although they are Seriously Wounded (–20%) and they outnumber 
their foe (+10%), giving them a final score of 30%. 

An opposed roll is made – the Pirates roll a 19, and the Spanish roll a 98. The pirates have won the 
roll. 

Now, onto damage. Damage rolls are made for both sides. For the damage suffered by the pirates, the 
roll is a 7, +1 damage to the next roll, so nothing too serious. 
 
For the Spanish, the roll is a 7 – BUT there is a still a +1 Running Wounds Total hanging over the 
Spanish from the last round of shooting. This increases the damage roll to an 8, for one level of damage. 
The Seriously Wounded Spanish are reduced to Mauled. This fight will soon be over…

Morale Tests
A Morale test must be made whenever:

•	
•	
•	

•	

A crew is reduced by one damage level.
A crew loses a Hand to Hand combat with a foe that considerably outnumbers them.
Something happens to demoralise the crew, such as their ship exploding or their captain 
dying before their eyes (assuming they like their captain). 
In sea battles, Morale tests can also be triggered by raising a pirate flag, or by vapouring.

A Morale test is made using the crew’s Persistence score. If this test is failed, then the crew’s nerve 
has faltered and they lose one level of Morale. On a critical success, the crew is galvanised by the 
challenge and gains one level of Morale.

If a Crew in battle is reduced to Low Morale, then they must make a Morale test every round, as 
their nerve slips. A Mutinous crew surrenders or flees, depending on circumstances. 

Aftermath
When a Crew Combat is finished, it is time to count the casualties and bury the dead. The crew 
must make a Resilience test to determine how severe the damage was, then consult the Aftermath 
table. Any outstanding Running Wounds Totals are directly translated into dead crew.

Successful Resilience Test
No lasting damage
1D6 crew killed, 10% injured
3D6 crew killed, 20% injured
4D6 crew killed, 30% injured
6D6 crew killed, 50% injured

Aftermath
Crew Was…
Fresh
Wounded
Seriously Wounded
Mauled
Slaughtered
 
To  finish  our  example  of  the  pirate  ambush  –  the  Spanish  broke  after  the  short  hand-to-hand 
engagement, falling back down the slope leading to the chests of gold dust lying on the track. The 
pirates are victorious – but at what cost? The pirates were never reduced below Fresh but they must 
still make a Resilience test.
 

Failed Resilience Test
1D3 crew killed, 10% injured
2D6 crew killed, 20% injured
4D6 crew killed, 30% injured
6D6 crew killed, 50% injured
2D6 survivors, all injured

Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

The pirates fail their test, so they suffer 1D6 casualties, +1 for the +1 Running Wounds Total still 
hanging over them. Five pirates have died, and 10% of their number – another 2 – have been injured. 

Meanwhile,  back  in  the  Spanish  fort,  the  enemy  count  their  dead. The  Spanish  were  reduced  to 
Mauled but they pass their Resilience test. Of the 40 Spanish, 4D6 are dead, and another 30% (13) 
are wounded. 

Heroic Actions
In a battle, Adventurers may get a chance to perform Heroic Actions, which are great deeds 
that inspire the crew. Heroic Actions can give a bonus to the Crew. Remember, Crew Combat 
Rounds take 30 seconds, while normal Adventurer-scale rounds only take five seconds, so there 
are six Adventurer-scale rounds per Crew Combat Round.

Sample Heroic Actions, and their effects on the battle as a whole, are listed here:

Heroic Actions

Inspiring the crew through conspicuous 
bravery

Crew Combat Summary
•	

Instead of Hit Points, crews have abstract health levels and a Running Wound Total. The 
Running Wound total adds to damage rolls and resets to zero whenever a crew loses a 
health level.
Attacks on crews either reduce health, or add to a Crew’s Running Wound Total.
Crews must also make Morale tests whenever they take damage.
At the end of the battle, an Aftermath roll is made to see how many crew were actually 
slain and how many were merely injured.

Special Crew Combats

These situations crop up often enough in pirate games to justify their own special rules.

Cannons
A cannon loaded with standard or chain shot will automatically kill 1D6 Crew on a successful 
gunnery test and increases the enemy crew’s Running Wounds Total by 1. 

Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

89

A cannon loaded with grape shot deals damage like a normal Firearms attack to a crew. Cannons 
are always ‘outnumbered’ by a crew, so they suffer a penalty to their damage rolls against crews, 
as follows:

Swivel Gun/9 pounder: –4
18 pounder: –3
24 pounder: –2
45 pounder: –0

Boarding Actions
When storming another ship, follow these steps:

Step One: Approach
If  the  Crew  is  attacking  from  their  ship,  then  it  must  be  brought  alongside  the  enemy  ship 
(which requires a successful opposed Shiphandling roll). 

If attacking from boats, then they must make a successful Boating test to grapple with the enemy 
ship. 

In both situations, the attackers will be vulnerable to fire from the target. The Approach takes at 
least one round, perhaps more.

Step Two: Boarding
Next round, the Crew must make a Boarding test. This is a Hand to Hand test against whatever 
crew are on deck but the attacking Crew suffers a base –50% penalty to their attack roll. They 
get a +20% bonus to their attack roll if they have Boarding Axes or Boarding Pikes, or if their 
ship is alongside the enemy vessel. 

If the attacking Crew fails to do any damage to the enemy crew, then they have been driven back 
and may try another Boarding test next round. If they do at least one level of damage to the 
enemy crew, then they have won a foothold on the foe’s deck and no further boarding actions 
need be made.

Note that if the crew boarded from their ship and not from boats, then the enemy crew can 
counter-attack without having to make their own Boarding test.

Example: The crew of the Greymantle are trying to board a fishing boat off Newfoundland. They try 
to board from their little ship, so they make a Shiphandling test to come alongside. If the fishermen had 
guns, then the pirates would be fired on as they closed but the fishing boat has no cannons or muskets.

The pirates come alongside and make a Boarding test. They have a Hand to Hand score of 45%, and the 
fishermen have a score of only 30%. However, the pirates suffer a –30% penalty as they try to force their 
way on board, so the actual Hand to Hand test is 15% vs. 30%. The pirates, by a quirk of fate, actually 
win. They roll a 7 for damage, which does not inflict a damage level on the fishermen, so the boarding 
action has actually failed. They can try again next round, however, and will have a +3 Running Wounds 
Total. They will likely fight their way onto the fishing boat’s deck eventually, but it will be costly.

Besieging a fort or walled town is difficult. Cannons can be used to blast through fortifications,

Ship to Ship Combat
Clashes between ships at sea are resolved as follows:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The two ships either engage each other in battle, or one attempts to flee. 
If one tries to flee, the other can give chase.
If they engage, or if the fleeing vessel is caught, then the two battle.
In a battle, both ships move, then exchange fire.
Sailors from one ship can attempt to board the other.
Battle  continues  until  one  ship  surrenders,  is  captured,  sunk,  explodes  or  otherwise 
defeated. 

Battle Stations!
In a battle, some of the pirate crew man the guns, others attend to the lines and the business 
of sailing the ship, and others use their muskets to fire at the enemy crew until they come close 
enough to board. Civilian ships operate with a much smaller crew and often have only enough 
men to sail and man a handful of guns. Warships, like pirate vessels, carry far more sailors than 
average.

Before battle, a captain should allocate some of his crew to these three stations:

Sailing Crew: See the description of each ship for the number of sailors needed to crew a ship. 
Optionally, a ship can have less than the minimum recommended crew – see page 48 for details 
on skeleton and prize crews. 

Gunnery Crew: See the description of each cannon for the number of sailors needed to operate 
it. Cannons can be undermanned but this increases the amount of time it takes to reload the 
weapon. A minimum of one man per cannon is required.

Boarding Crew: The rest of the crew fires muskets from the deck when in range, or engages in 
boarding actions. This crew can also vapour to intimidate the enemy.

Damage to these three crews should be tracked separately on the crew sheet.

Remember, if a crew’s Morale is reduced to Mutinous, then they will likely surrender or flee. 
Pirates can also use Vapouring to further attack an enemy crew’s Morale. 

No Quarter: A captain can also choose to raise the red flag of slaughter, declaring that he will 
offer no mercy to the enemy crew. If this is done, then the enemy crew must make a Morale 
test immediately but it also means they will not surrender; they will fight to the last (or mutiny 
against their commander and try to join the pirates). 

Chases
In a chase, both ships make opposed Shiphandling tests. The winner may increase the relative 
movement of their ship by 1D6 x 6 feet this Crew Combat Round. 

When being chased, the pursuing ship can fire its chase guns and the pursued ship can return 
fire with aft guns.

Manoeuvring 
If ships are closing for battle, then they can manoeuvre for better position. There are several 
manoeuvres that can be attempted – if miniatures or other representations are being used then 
questions about line of sight and firing arcs can be resolved there. Alternatively, manoeuvres can 
be kept abstract, with just the relative positions of the two ships being considered.

A ship running fighting sail or below may turn up to 90 degrees in a single Crew Combat Round. 
A ship running plain sail or higher may only turn 45 degrees in a single Crew Combat Round.

If the ship’s Helmsman is an Adventurer then he may use his own Shiphandling skill instead of 
the crew’s skill for these tests. 

Only one of the following Manoeuvres may be attempted in a particular round.

Hard Turn!: With a successful Shiphandling test, a ship may turn an extra 45 degrees this round.

Steady!:  The helmsman endeavours to hold the ship steady, to provide a stable platform for 
firing. If the Shiphandling test is successful, then any Gunnery tests made by the crew this round 
gain a +10% bonus.

Evasive Action: By steering erratically or keeping out of the arc of fire of the enemy ship, the 
helmsman tries to protect his vessel. If the Shiphandling test is successful, then any Gunnery 
attacks on the ship suffer a –10% penalty.

Close For Boarding: The helmsman attempts to bring his vessel close enough to the enemy ship 
for boarding. Opposed Shiphandling tests must be made; if the Adventure wins, then the crew 
may attempt to board the enemy ship. 

Firing
As a ship is pitching up and down in the midst of battle, it counts as Unstable Ground, inflicting a 
–20% penalty to all ranged attack rolls. The Steady manoeuvre mitigates this penalty somewhat. 
Especially rough conditions can increase this penalty.

Muskets  &  Small  Arms:  These  attacks  take  place  as  normal  for  Crew  Combat.  If  there  are 
multiple Crews on the enemy vessel (a boarding party and sailors, for instance), then choose 
randomly which crew takes the damage. The hull value of the ship is applied as a modifier to 
the damage roll. 

Swivel Guns: Each swivel gun fires independently. A swivel gun can be loaded with round shot, 
in which case it deals its listed damage (2D6 damage), or grape shot (standard firearms damage 
to crew with a –4 penalty). 

Cannon: Cannons can be fired in four different ways:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Single Firing with Round Shot
Single Firing with Grape Shot
Single Firing with Chain Shot
Broadside

Single Firing: Single firing a cannon uses the formal Ranged Attack rules, not the Crew Combat 
rules. If an Adventurer is alone firing the cannon, he may use his own Gunnery score instead of 
that of the crew.

If round shot is used, then the attack deals normal damage for a cannon of that type.

If grape shot is used, then the attack deals damage to the crew of the enemy ship.

If chain shot is used, then the attack must use a Precise Attack (–40%) to accurately aim at the 
enemy mast. If this attack is successful, then a critical hit is automatically scored on the enemy 
mast. See Cannon Critical Hits. 

Broadside: A broadside consists of several cannons firing simultaneously. All the cannons fired 
must be of the same time and loaded with the same shot. While each shot is less accurate than 
a single shot attack, filling the air with that much lead does aid immensely. A broadside attack, 
therefore, has a +20% bonus to the Gunnery test, often counter-acting the penalty from the 
ship’s Movement. 

To be fully effective, a broadside should have at least eight cannon firing simultaneously. For 
every cannon less than eight, subtract one when rolling for how many shots actually hit, to a 
maximum of –4. A broadside cannot be fired with fewer than four cannon. Larger broadsides 
gain a +1 to this roll per extra cannon, to a maximum of 12.

Roll 2D6 on the Broadsides table to determine how many shots actually hit. 

If the Gunnery test is a critical, then the broadside scores 1 critical on the enemy ship.

Boarding Actions
See page 90 for rules on boarding actions.

Vapouring
Instead of shooting at an enemy crew, or attempting a boarding action, a boarding crew can 
engage in the practice called vapouring. This involves creating a din with shouts, banging or 
drumming on the sides of the ship, clashing swords, singing, cursing and otherwise intimidating 
the  enemy.  Vapouring  can  only  be  attempted  when  the  other  crew  is  close  enough  to  be 
intimidated – generally, when the ships are in range of cannons. 

To vapour, the boarding crew must make a Perform test. If successful, the enemy must make a 
Morale test immediately. A crew can vapour multiple times but the enemy will only lose Morale 
from the effect once (the Games Master should roll the result of the Morale test secretly, so the 
pirates do not know if their intimidation had any effect). 

Sinking Ships
A ship loses one Seaworthiness for every 10 points of damage it suffers from a single attack (i.e. 
a single hit from a cannon, not from a whole broadside). 
 
A  ship  that  has  lost  all  its  Seaworthiness  is  now  sinking.  A  ship  that  has  been  boarded  and 
captured can be scuttled, causing it to sink. 
 

Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

Destroying Ships
A ship reduced to 0 Structural Points has been smashed to smithereens. Wreckage from the ship 
continues to float but the ship is no more. If a ship is carrying gunpowder and ammo aboard in 
a powder room, then this can be hit in a battle, either through a critical hit, or through a Heroic 
Action as part of a boarding action. A ton of exploding gunpowder barrels does 6D6 Structural 
Damage. 
 
Aftermath of Battles
Damage to crews is resolved normally after a battle at sea. A diminished pirate crew can often 
pick up replacement members from the survivors of a defeated prize, although men forced to go 
on the account are rarely loyal to their new pirate brethren and may desert or rebel if the chance 
arises. 

Critical Hits on Ships
If a cannon attack scores a critical hit on a ship, then roll on the Critical Hits table. Re-roll if the 
result makes no sense (such as a mast falling on a rowboat – not that the chances of a rowboat 
being anything other than floating wreckage after a cannon hit are very high).

On a successful chain shot attack, roll 1D6 on the Critical Hits table.

Critical Hits

Damage
Mast Topples – one of the ship’s masts falls, halving its Movement, giving a –50% 
penalty to Shiphandling tests and dealing 4D6 Structure Points of damage
Sail Falls – one of the ship’s sails plummets to the deck, halving its Movement, 
giving a –50% penalty to Shiphandling tests and adding 1D6 to the Crew’s 
Running Wounds Total.
Rigging Damaged – the ship’s rigging is damaged, preventing it from changing sail 
and giving a –20% penalty to Shiphandling tests.
Crew Maimed – the attack tears through the crew on deck, adding 2D6 to the 
Crew’s Running Wounds Total.
Officer Struck – one of the officers is hit by the cannon ball. If he is an 
Adventurer, he may spend a Hero Point to be merely thrown overboard instead of 
killed by the explosion.
Fire – a fire has broken out on board. See fires.
Especially Damaging Hit – roll cannon damage again.
Cannons Damaged – 1D4 of the ship’s cannons are destroyed by the attack.

Holed Below The Waterline – the ship is holed, losing 2D6 Seaworthiness.
Rudder Damage: –50% penalty to Shiphandling test.

ports, trade and law

Ports are places to trade goods, to replenish supplies, to get uproariously drunk – but they also 
can be the seat of authority in the Caribbean and so many pirates have ended their days hanging 
from a gallows at the end of a pier. Especially daring and powerful pirate gangs have even raided 
and sacked entire ports! Ports vary in size and importance. Every port will have a few docked 
ships and some defences like cannons in a fort overlooking the harbour. The most important 
ports are built to resist full-scale attacks by enemy navies and are more than a match for all but 
the most audacious rogue. 

Pirate Ports are lawless places like Tortuga, Port Royal (before its destruction), the Bahamas 
or Madagascar where pirate ships can land safely. Everyone here is a rogue or villain, or at least 
friendly to them. 

Local Ports and Minor Trade Ports are small ports which might only see a trade ship a handful 
of times per year. Pirates sometimes prey on these ports but more often they come here to sell 
stolen goods. Many places will accept the cargo of pirate ships if it is sold cheaply enough, no 
questions asked. Some landowners are in league with the pirates, sheltering and supplying them 
in exchange for cheap goods.

Major Trade Ports are the heart of commerce in the modern age. Ships from Africa and Europe 
dock here regularly, bringing manufactured goods and slaves and taking on all the produce of the 
Caribbean and the Americas. These places are too law-abiding for the most part to accept known 
pirates but disguised pirate vessels or less notorious villains can enter and trade. Taking a major 
trade port is a coup for a pirate gang.

Fortresses are rare in the Caribbean – these are major ports with extra guns and fortifications, 
the centre of Imperial power in a region.

Reception table:

21–30
31+

Result
The Adventurer is not recognised, he may trade freely.
The Adventurer is not recognised but he is found to be suspicious.
The Adventurer is recognised as a pirate and may be attacked.
The Adventurer is recognised and will be attacked if possible.

Roll on the Pirate Reception table again if the Adventurer causes a nuisance, or acts in a very 
suspicious way (such as selling off stolen goods openly).

Selling Off Your Ill-Gotten Gains
Having a hold full of stolen spices, silks and blood-stained doubloons is all well and good but 
if you cannot trade them for a willing wench and a flagon of ale, what good are they? There are 
several ways for a pirate to sell off stolen goods:

•	

•	

Legally: If an Adventurer can enter a port without being identified as a pirate, then he 
can just use the normal trade rules.
Smuggling: An Adventurer can sell on the black market. This works like normal trade 
but smugglers cannot expect to get as good a deal as a legal trader. Pirates dealing with 
smugglers therefore suffer a –50% penalty to their Influence attempts.

Adventurers can engage in legitimate trade as well as piracy. 

The base sale price is listed in the Plunder tables. Goods are bought at a price starting at half 
that  listed  in  the  tables.  An  Adventurer  may  make  an  Influence  test  to  increase  the  price  by 
+10% (+20% on a critical success). Supply and demand can also affect the price (see the Price

The Law

While every governor and nation complains about piracy, the various navies are often slow to 
react to pirate attacks. Often, the ships sent on the hunt are too slow to catch the pirates, or 
unable to enter the shallow coves and shoals where the elusive thieves hide. It is not until the 
latter stages of the Age of Piracy that the Royal Navy starts sending smaller, faster ships to hunt 
down the pirates.

Governors  may  also  employ  mercenaries  and  privateers  to  deal  with  especially  troublesome 
pirates. When a pirate attacks a ship, there is a chance that it attracts the attention of a governor. 
Take  the  pirate’s  crime  from  the  Misdemeanour  table,  add  the  pirate’s  Reputation,  and  roll 
1D100 to see if retribution is warranted.

Captured Pirates
If a pirate is captured by the authorities, then his remaining few days are likely to be unpleasant. 
If there is time and a nearby fortress, or if the authorities wish to question the pirates, then the 
condemned men will be brought back to a port and imprisoned there before they are tried. They 
may even be sent back to Europe to face trial there – this is especially true for famous pirates 
(Reputation 30+), whose trials will attract great attention and prestige. On the other hand, some 
of the ordinary pirates may simply be hung there and then, to warn others of the wages of sin. 

In a trial, witnesses of the pirate’s crimes will be brought forward. Often, a pirate’s crew will 
turn against him, claiming to have been forced onto the account on pain of death and pleading 
for clemency. Offering pardons to pirates is a cheap and easy way to deal with the problem, as 
is offering them commissions as privateers. Such loopholes will only be offered, however, if the 
pirate is worth more to the authorities alive than dead.

campaign ideas

The basic structure of Pirates of Legend is a simple one – roll up your Adventurer, your ship and 
your crew, then go off in search of plunder. That basic core remains true for all these campaigns 
but there are many ways to explore that same pirate experience with the players.

Historical Piracy

While there is a wealth of books and research material about pirates, most will just point you 
at the classic ‘A General History of the Most Notorious Pyrates’ by Captain Charles Johnson (or 
Daniel Defoe, depending on who you ask). This classic book lists the deeds and crimes of, well, 
the most notorious pirates, and is an excellent source of adventure ideas. The simplest historical 
campaign is a relatively random one – few pirates had a cunning plan for conquest and plunder. 
More complex games can delve into the movements of empires and religions in that chaotic 
period. 

Most historical games will tend towards the gritty and the unpleasant. Non-Player Characters are 
more likely to die of dysentery or scurvy than in a dramatic battle at sea. Few pirates prospered 
but their own incompetence and lack of discipline was matched only by the navy’s indolence and 
poor tactics. Historical campaigns will also touch on unpleasant issues, like slavery, and (Anne 
Bonny and Mary Read aside) there is little scope for female Adventurers to get involved in on 
the action. 

Historical campaigns appeal to players who are willing to delve into the details and learn about 
the period. Given the length of the Golden Age, it is best to focus on one period or the career of 
a particular pirate (Blackbeard or Bartholomew Roberts are prime candidates) and gather all the 
information you can about them. The Adventurers could be crew on board those ships – or even 
take on the roles of historical figures. For example, Captain Roberts (one of the most successful 
pirates on record) travelled for much of his career with a crew of pirates who practically scream 
‘Adventurer’ like Anastis (a huge brute, proud of his physical strength), dour Gillespie, or La 
Palisse, who stayed loyal to his battered old sloop even when Roberts captured bigger and bigger 
ships for his crew to use.
 
Another option is to have the Adventurers be the crew on board a merchant ship that is attacked 
or taken by pirates. They are forced to go on the account at sword-point due to their skills at 
sailing and now have to make the best of a dangerous situation. Do the Adventurers try to escape 
and turn on their criminal comrades, or do they embrace the pirate lifestyle and plunder what 
they can until the law catches up with them?

The Caribbean in the Golden Age of Piracy is divided between the Great Powers of Europe, 
primarily Spain, England, France and the Netherlands. By the 1700s, the original treasure of the 
Caribbean – the silver and gold of South America – is nearly gone but the islands are becoming 
valuable producers of various goods, notably sugar and tobacco. Diseases brought by the early 
explorers ravage the native populations, forcing the importation of many thousands of slaves 
from Africa to work the plantations. The various ports and settlements fight proxy wars for the 
powers – it is a lawless, dangerous region. 

Elsewhere in the world, the colonies on the east coast of North America are thriving but are still 
secondary in importance to the more established colonies in the south. Trade with the East is 
expanding quickly and the foundations for the European empires of the coming centuries are 
being laid. The globe is being explored – the Australian continent has been discovered and better 
charts are being made. Navigation is still something of an art, not a science. While methods for 
discovering one’s longitude (north/south location) are well known (relying on taking sightings 
of the horizon and the sun or stars), correct measurement of latitude is not yet possible and will 
not be until more accurate clocks are made. 

The Reformation is still a major factor in European politics. Spain and France are Catholic; 
England and the Netherlands are Protestant. Religious civil wars regularly tear the continent 
apart. 

Spain is the most established of the great powers in the Caribbean but its fortunes in Europe 
are waning. Its ports are the oldest and best fortified but are only lightly protected. Their Dutch 
rivals are wealthy but the Netherlands have few holdings in the Caribbean and their attention 
is mainly focussed on trade with the East. England and France are both expansionist powers, 
establishing new colonies and sending more ships into the region. 

Buccaneers and Privateers
Early Spanish settlers had let pigs and other animals run wild on many of the islands of the 
Caribbean. In the mid-1600s, bands of sailors, thieves, rogues and vagabonds take to living on 
these pigs, cooking their flesh in barbeques called boucans. The Spanish authorities drive the 
buccaneers away from the settled parts of Hispaniola and the other islands, earning the enmity 

102
Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

of the rogues. The buccaneers raid Spanish ports in retaliation, stealing and looting. The lawless 
buccaneers are a ready source of men for treasurer hunters and piracy. They are also masters of 
the lawless port of Tortuga. 

In  1668-1671,  one  of  the  most  famous  of  the  buccaneers,  the  Welshman  Henry  Morgan, 
leads several major attacks on the Spanish towns of Portobello and Panama. He carries away 
a considerable fortune and does such damage to Spanish interests in the Caribbean that he is 
rewarded with the governorship of Port Royal on Jamaica. 

Technically, Morgan and many of his compatriots are privateers, not pirates. The distinction is 
a subtle one – a privateer sails and fights under a letter of marque granted by some governor, 
representing one of the powers. Henry Morgan got his commission from the English Governor 
of Jamaica, which legally authorised him to make war on the Spanish ports he attacked. He is 
effectively a mercenary, not a criminal, at least under English law. The Spanish would hang him 
as a thief if they catch him. The practise of privateering waxes and wanes depending on events 
in Europe – when Spain goes to war with England, then every pirate in the Caribbean will sign 
up with one side or the other, so they can loot ships and sell their prizes legally in the port of the 
opposing side. When the war ends, the privateers may promise to become law-abiding traders 
but the lure of piracy and the freedom of the seas is often too strong. 

The Golden Age of Piracy
The period known as the Golden Age of Piracy lasts roughly from the sacking of Panama in 
1671 to the 1720s, when Woodes Rogers’ offer of the pardon to the pirates of Nassau Port is 
largely accepted. The rise of the British Navy’s pirate-hunting efforts are largely responsible for 
the decline of the pirates.

During the golden age, there are hundreds of pirate attacks on ships in the Caribbean. In any 
given year, there are four or five notorious pirate captains at large. A captain might be active for 
a few years before retiring to live off his ill-gotten gains, or when he is caught and tried. Most 
captains are traders or even soldiers who went rogue and turned to piracy. 

The piratical lifestyle is appealing to many sailors, who work in very harsh conditions for little 
pay. Instead of being one of ten sailors on a cargo ship, risking life and limb for a few schillings 
and watching your masters back in Europe reap the huge financial rewards of a successful voyage, 
you could join a pirate ship. With so many crew on board a pirate ship, there is much less work 
and the promise of vast rewards. The pirates are lazy, drunk, undisciplined and often delighted 
in their viciousness and depravity but their ways are undeniably alluring. Many crews willingly 
follow their captain when he turns pirate, so long as he keeps bringing down prizes.

The Caribbean
The buccaneer port of Tortuga is the metaphorical and geographical heart of the pirate Caribbean. 
This lawless town is located on the north coast of the great island of Hispaniola. The island itself 
is, as of 1697, divided into two sections. The western section is St. Domingue and is owned by 
the French, who are allies to the buccaneers. St. Domingue is known for its sugar plantations 
and many now-respectable and wealthy landowners here are actually former buccaneers. The east 
side of the island, Santo Domingo, is still Spanish but has been so ravaged by pirate raids that it 
is now very poor and of little importance. 

To the west of Hispaniola is Cuba, the major Spanish holding in the Caribbean. It is a wealthy 
island, with many rich plantations. The fortress of El Morro is the centre of the Spanish military 
forces, while the capital of Havana is the place to trade goods. In the Caribbean, the Spanish 

Jeremy Bauerle (order #6303863)

also hold Porto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago and once held Jamaica. Porto Rico is poor but well-
fortified  and  is  used  by  the  Spanish  navy  as  a  base. Trinidad  is  a  troubled  colony,  prone  to 
violence, but it is better than its neighbour Tobago, which has been plunged into near-anarchy 
by repeated wars and invasions. 

In the west, in South America, Spain has several other colonies. The famous Treasure Fleets bring 
the wealth of these colonies, especially silver and gold, through the Caribbean en route to Spain.

The English seized Jamaica from the Spanish in 1655 and the island has prospered as a source 
of sugar. They also hold many of the islands in the north of the Caribbean, from the treacherous 
shoals of the Bahamas to many of the Virgin and Leeward Islands, as well as the Cayman Islands. 
The Bahamas (especially Nassau Port in New Providence, home of the infamous Blackbeard) 
and Caymans are more pirate haunts than English but St. Kitts, Barbados, Nevis and Montserrat 
are all thriving.

The French holdings in the Caribbean are more tenuous. They share St. Kitt’s with the English, 
St. Martin’s with the Dutch and Hispaniola with the Spanish. They also have the spice island of 
Grenada and the prosperous colonies on Guadeloupe and Martinique.

Finally, the Dutch claim many of the other islands in the Caribbean but all too often these are 
used as pirate bases. The main Dutch trade town of Willemstad, rivalling Havana in importance, 
is on Curacao.

Techniques
Research: Between the internet and the library, there is a wealth of information on piracy out 
there, which will give plenty of ideas for adventures. Gather as much information as you can 
and encourage the players to immerse themselves too (alternatively, have the Adventurers live 
sheltered lives or suffer from amnesia, so they can learn about the historical setting in-character). 

Handouts:  Research  will  give  rise  to  plenty  of  documents  and  texts  from  the  era  of  piracy 
and players love handouts. Descriptions of famous pirates, geographical treatises on the islands, 
copies of laws and treaties – print them out and tack them up around the gaming area. Use copies 
of maps from the era instead of modern maps. 

Do not Sweat The Details: While keeping close to the historical ideals is necessary for this style 
of play, actually having fun and playing a game is even more important. The Games Master 
should  never  let  the  game  stop  because  of  some  historical  inconsistency.  If  two  players  are 
arguing over exactly what sort of rigging was in common use in 1720, get them to postpone the 
discussion until after the game and move onto plundering ships. The aim of historical campaigns 
is to explore history through a game and the game should come first.

Campaign Ideas:
Shipwrecked: The game begins with the Adventurers being cast up on a desert island following 
a terrible storm that destroyed several ships in a convoy. The Adventurers are the only survivors. 
They have to survive on the island for some time, until a pirate vessel arrives on the island to 
careen. The only way off the island is to sign up with the pirates.

Pirate Hunters: Another option is to cast the players as naval officers, in pursuit of pirates. Give 
them the bare minimum of resources (an armed sloop and a crew of sullen sailors who are already 
grumbling and mutinous) and pit them against historical pirates. Can the players do better than 
real-world pirate hunters? The Games Master can just consult history books for the actions and 
strengths of the various notable pirates.

Cinematic Piracy

A cinematic game covers much the same ground as a historical campaign but takes the best bits 
instead of holding itself to actual history. Pirates were the pulp villains of their day and pirate 
movies invariably involve swashbuckling, dramatic rescues and duels, good-hearted rogues or 
monstrous foes, castles on crumbling cliffs, massive battles at sea and piles of gold and jewels. 
In short, cinematic games should ooze coolness and drama. At the same time, a large part of the 
appeal of a pirate game is the setting, so the Games Master should always emphasise and cherish 
the classic elements of piracy.

In a cinematic game, emotion and character are far more important than treasure. An Adventurer 
should not become a pirate just to steal gold – there should always be some other reason for 
turning pirate. Perhaps he wants revenge on all civilisation, a la Captain Nemo; perhaps some 
diabolical relative has framed him for a terrible crime and he has to hide among the outlaws until 
he can reclaim his fortune; perhaps some noble woman is rebelling against an arranged marriage 
and intends to humiliate her intended husband by defeating his naval vessel. 

One trick is to ensure that each Adventurer is linked to at least one other Adventurer. Adventurer 
A might be the old shipmate of Adventurer B; Adventurer B might be lusting after young Miss 
C; Adventurer D is secretly C’s old uncle, who ran away to sea as a young man and turned pirate. 
In this way, even if each Adventurer has their own dramatic tale unfolding, the various stories 
cross over and allow the Adventurers to act as a group. This also opens up a scope for betrayal – 
pirates are thieves, after all, and unexpected reversals when your old shipmate turns on you are 
par for the course. 

Techniques 
Think Cinema: Frame scenes and situations as if your game was a big-budget movie. Always 
leap into conflict (whether it is an argument, an important decision or a swordfight) as soon 
as possible. Reflect the mood of a scene in the surroundings and the weather – storms signify 
trouble, rainstorms despair, sunshine joy and so forth. 

Get Personal: Tie everything into the Adventurers. A villain should never just be a bad guy – he 
should be related to the Adventurers or have some other prior connection to them. Try to evoke 
emotion as much as possible and throw Hero Points around for dramatic speeches and cool ideas. 

Campaign Ideas
The Treasure Map: Treasure Island did it first but it is a classic for a reason. A band of pirates 
(say, Henry Morgan’s buccaneers) bury a vast treasure. They draw a map describing its location, 
then divide the map up between them. The Adventurers have inherited or otherwise obtained 
a few parts of the map. You need the whole map to find the treasure (there is no X marking the 
spot; the location of the treasure is determined by drawing lines between various landmarks). 
The first part of the campaign involves the Adventurers searching for the other sections of the 
map, which are scattered over the whole Caribbean in the hands of former pirates; the second 
part involves finding the mysterious island, reconstructing the map and recovering the treasure 
(optionally – the mysterious island is home to hostile natives, or ancient ruins, or a giant gorilla, 
or dinosaurs).

Revenge!: The Adventurers were once passengers on a ship that was attacked by a notorious 
pirate. They survived but everything they owned and loved was taken from them. Now, they have 
banded together for revenge – only to discover that their old nemesis took a pardon from the 
Spanish king and is now a wealthy and respected plantation owner (he is still secretly sponsoring

pirate attacks, of course). The Adventurers have to battle their foe’s minions and expose his pirate 
connections to the Spanish court, before a final confrontation in the villain’s castle.

Libertalia!: Some sources (like A General History of Pyrates) claim that a free pirate nation called 
Libertalia was founded by a renegade French captain named Mission. Stealing a Dutch slave 
ship, he and his crew declared themselves in opposition to all the powers and states of Europe, 
as well as the Church. All men were equal; all goods would be held in common. Driven by these 
beliefs and by the white flag of liberty, they colonised a part of northern Madagascar. 

While there were certainly pirate hideouts in Madagascar, it is unlikely that any were as organised 
as Libertalia was supposed to be. The idea of a pirate nation is great for gaming however – just 
transplant Libertalia to the Caribbean and give the Adventurers a great home base to sail from!

Supernatural Piracy

Supernatural elements can be added to either a cinematic or historical pirate game. A little bit 
of weirdness can fit nicely into either style of game, while a whole lot of weirdness moves your 
campaign into the field of alternate history or outright fantasy. No matter what supernatural 
elements you add, the essential core of piracy has to be maintained. There have to be empires 
and colonies trading in the Caribbean and there have to be wild, cruel men on ships raiding 
and stealing from these empires. There has to be something valuable sought by those empires, 
something that drew people to these warm seas. 

Pirates and Ghosts: Tales of ghost ships and spectral pirates are classics of the genre and there 
are numerous ways to incorporate them. One subtle way is to have a ghost appear to only one of 
the Adventurers, a mysterious spectre who is guarding him or guiding him to a particular destiny. 
Pirates live violent, dangerous lives and there is plenty of opportunity for a violent death to give 
rise to a ghost. Perhaps a ghost is trying to ensure that the Adventurers eventually track down and 
kill the pirate who murdered him in the first place.

Alternatively,  what  if  going  on  the  account  opens  the  Adventurers’  eyes  to  the  spirit  world? 
What if all those symbols of death and mortality associated with pirates had a deeper, occult 
meaning? Perhaps every pirate vessel had its own cloud of angry, vengeful ghosts trailing after it. 
Captains might interrogate ghosts for intelligence about other ships and trade routes. Certain 
ghosts might be especially sought after – the spectre of a particularly talented navigator would be 
a treasure worth killing for. Piracy could be the new form of necromancy…

Pirates and Voodoo: The vodun religion was carried from West Africa to the Caribbean by slaves 
and soon acquired many followers among escaped slaves and on the islands. There were many 
escaped slaves among the pirates, who lived at the fringes of society, so it is possible that they 
learned something of the loa spirits and how to placate and command them. In this game, the 
Loa are powerful spirits who can be tapped for power if you know what rites and gifts to offer 
them.

While some practitioners of vodun are careful and respectful when dealing with the Loa, pirates 
take a more direct approach. With blades of cold iron quenched in stolen holy water, they go to 
the places where the spirit world encroaches onto the real world, to islands that appear only at the 
darkest hours of the night, to haunted crossroads sacred to Legba, to steaming jungles where the 
trees speak with old voices out of Africa. There, they attack the loa until they submit, enslaving 
them to serve the pirates.

If placated or defeated, the spirit can be bound to a pirate. As this particular Loa is a storm-spirit, 
then the pirate who commands it could gain one of the following abilities:

Pirates  and  Clockwork:  In  the  year  955  AH,  Taqi  al-Din  Mohammed  ibn  Ma’ruf  (peace 
be  upon  him)  started  the  Great  Observatory  of  Istanbul  and  ushered  in  a  golden  age  of 
scientific  and  technological  innovation  within  the  Sublime  Ottoman  State.  One  year  after 
the  construction  of  the  Great  Observatory,  a  fisherman  in  Cyprus  discovered  a  strange 
machine  that  was  brought  to  al-Din  for  study.  Ottoman  scientists  reworked  the  device  into 
an  effective  tool  for  mapmaking  and  navigation,  while  other  tinkers  used  the  principles 
behind  the  device’s  operation  to  process  census  data,  plan  crop  rotations  and  provision 
armies. Sultan Murad III was so enamoured by the devices that he sent out a fleet of specially-
equipped ships to map the seven seas for the glory of Allah and the Sublime Ottoman State.  
 
This  brief  flowering  of  technology  ended  in  the  year  958  AH,  when  al-Din’s  calculations 
showed  that,  despite  the  sighting  of  a  comet  seen  by  the  soothsayers  of  Sultan  Murad

III,  his  armies  would  not  prevail  against  a  smaller  but  better-prepared  Persian  army.  The 
Great  Observatory  was  destroyed  and  the  exploratory  fleet’s  crews  denied  return  to  port.  
 
Many of the ships made their way to Europe, where their crews were promptly detained and 
interrogated. The French were the first to openly accept the exiles, with la vie Sufisme informing 
discussion in the salons of the wealthy and French merchant ships receiving accurate maps of 
the  Mediterranean  and  North  African  coasts. The  other  great  powers  followed  suit,  building 
their own ‘Hajji Devices’ for their own use. These devices, and the maps they generated, were 
well-kept state secrets, allowing easy access to the wealth of the New World and the Indies...  
 
...  until  a  French  ship’s  captain  named  Mission  disappeared  with  a  Hajji  device  and,  a  few 
months  later,  the  first  ‘Libertatian  Gazetteer’  appeared  in  the  sailor’s  taverns  of  Marseilles, 
providing full access to the trade routes of the Great Powers and their tame merchant houses.  
 
Thirty years later, the Spanish Main bears the marks of all of these influences. Freebooters sailing 
under the flag of Libertatia trade booty for Hajji codes with artificers in the free city of Port o’ 
Clocks, while Sufee Levellers from the Republic of Rhode Island open safe harbours and open 
markets throughout the New World. Buccaneers speak with dread of the Scylla, a Hajji Machine 
set to watch over the treacherous bay of Cartagena, while Jesuit artificers work towards a day 
when the machines will perfectly reflect every aspect of God’s creation.

In this setting, ancient Greek clockworks have been developed by the Ottomans and later by 
Europe, giving rise to a world of brass computers and clockwork cyberpunk. A pirate might steal 
the navigational data for a merchant ship and feed it into his brig’s onboard Hajji Machine (or 
hasher, as pirate argot has it), allowing him to sail precisely to the location of the merchant and 
intercept it. When within range, remorseless and terrible engines give precise firing solutions to 
the banks of cannons…

Clockwork Equipment
Hajji Device: This is the most common form of clockwork computer, used for navigation. The 
Hajji device is a heavy contraption of brass wheels, lodestones and glass dials, roughly the size 
of a buckler shield. A ship’s destination and course are input as numbers and the Hajji device 
automatically calculates the ship’s course. A clever operator can sail to any point on the surface 
of the globe by correctly programming these machines.

Calculating Engine: Calculating engines are made from rank upon rank of Hajji devices. They 
are powered by hand-cranks or treadmills, although it is said that the English have developed a 
steam-powered machine that runs far quicker than any other engine. A calculating engine can do 
mathematics at great speed and with perfect accuracy. In battle, calculating engines are used to 
provide firing solutions (giving a bonus to Gunnery tests – an average calculating engine gives a 
bonus of +20% to hit and more powerful military models can give up to +75% to hit).

Other calculating engines are used to produce the secret books of codes and logs that are vital for 
navigation with Hajji devices.

Brazen  Head:  A  curiosity,  Brazen  Heads  are  small  but  very  clever  calculating  engines. They 
speak using an intricate series of valves and bellows, and can hold discourse on a variety of topics. 
These Machine Intellects are no more than amusing toys in the eyes of most people, with no 
more true intelligence than a parrot or an Irishman – but those who listen to the advice of this 
clacking automata can sometimes learn strange secrets…

Clockwork  Hand:  Hook  hands  and  peg-legs  are  a  thing  of  the  past!  While  no  artificer  has 
managed to create a living automaton, they can make replacement limbs and even clockwork 
hands that function almost as well as the real thing, so long as they are wound regularly.

Pirates and Dragons: The jungles of South America held a terrible secret – the true rulers of 
the Aztec empire were the dragons. These terrible lizards squatted atop stepped pyramids and 
demanded gold and bloody sacrifices from their followers. Cortez and his conquistadors turned 
dragon-slayer and, after many decades of war, the Dragon Empire was toppled and all the great 
wyrms were slain. 

A few eggs survived however and they can be hatched through alchemical means. Dragons take 
many centuries to grow to full size but beasts as large as small ships are not unheard of even in 
this day and age. Some dragons are owned by various nobles, others are used as weapons by 
the navy. Some have even fallen into the hands of pirates – even a small dragon can destroy a 
prize’s rigging, paralysing the merchant ship and allowing the pirates to catch it easily. Dragons 
instinctively crave gold and pirates who fail to find enough coin to keep their dragon happy can 
find their secret weapon turn on them.

There are rumours, of course, of an elder dragon that fled the dragonslayers and took refuge 
somewhere in the Caribbean…

Optionally for this campaign, the dragons are the highly evolved descendants of the dinosaurs, 
who  somehow  survived  the  asteroid  impact  that  wiped  the  rest  out.  Speaking  of  which, 
the  Caribbean  is  one  possible  location  for  the  lost  city  of  Atlantis.  Pirates  with  Altantean 
supertechnology powered by meteor shards, anyone?

Otherworldly Piracy

Players of traditional Legend campaigns may wish to integrate piracy into their fantasy games. 
Fantasy worlds rarely include gunpowder – this can be replaced by magic, or just dropped entirely. 
Pirates can capture prizes through boarding actions and with bows instead of with cannon-fire. 

Finally, it might also be necessary to adjust the prices for treasures to something more reasonable 
– most fantasy worlds have a lot more gold and jewels than the Caribbean, so the cost of treasure 
should be reduced significantly. 

One nice thing about a Pirates of Legend game is that you can start it as a historical pirate game, 
then suddenly spin the characters off into utmost strangeness.

Legend & Open Content

Here at Mongoose Publishing, we want what we truly believe to be one of the best fantasy 
RPGs on the market to be easy to use and modify.  We have therefore made this rulebook 

Open Content, in conjunction with the Open Game Licence.  

All the text of this book is designated as Open Content – this means you are free to use 

the Open Game Licence (overleaf) to reproduce this text and build upon it with your own 
scenarios and mechanics. You can even print and sell such work, if that is your desire (and we 

would wish you the very best of luck if you choose to do this!).

By using the Open Content of this book, you also have permission to download the Legend 

Compatible logo from our web site (on the Legend product pages), and use that on any Legend 

work you publish, to demonstrate your material is part of the wider Legend family.

Please note that the artwork in this book is not Open Content.

All books in the core Legend range (those whose titles have the word ‘Legend’ in them) 

will also be designated as Open Content, allowing you to expand your own games in many 

different directions, while maintaining a solid root that everyone will be familiar with.

For example, you might be using Legend to produce your own gaming world. If you wanted 
to add some high seas action, you can simply and quickly bring over the Open Content rules 
we produce in, say, Pirates of Legend, knowing that everyone who plays Legend will at least be 

familiar with those rules.

‘A pyrate is Hostis humanis generis, a common Enemy, with whom neither Faith nor 
Oath is kept… if Pyracy be committed on the Ocean, and the Pyrates in the attempt 

be overcome, the Captors may, without any Solemnity of Condemnation, hang 

them up at the Main Yard; if they are brought to the next port and the Judge rejects 

the Tryal, or the Captors cannot wait for the Judge, without Peril or Loss, Justice 

may be done upon them by the Captors.’

Pirates of Legend brings the golden age of piracy to life! Lay hand to your cutlass 
and stick your pistols in your belt, friend – adventure is waiting for you offshore. 
Band together with other scurvy dogs and take command of a ship and crew. Lead 
them to victory and plunder, or to a watery grave! Win fame and fortune or dangle 

at the end of the yardarm when the Navy catches up with you!

The shining blue waters of the Caribbean lie before you and the wind is in your 

sails. What you do next is up to you!
