welcome to legend

This book contains all you will need for adventuring in worlds of sword and sorcery, where a good 
blade is all that stands between you and certain doom.  The rules presented in this volume can be 
tailored to a wide variety of settings and genres although the focus is primarily on gritty fantasy 
with a heroic feel. These rules are not confined to just one world: the rules are characterised by 
flexibility and intuition, permitting Games Masters, players and their Adventurers to explore just 
about any milieu they care to. The game focuses on characters and their capabilities, grounding 
everything from an adventuring perspective. Using Legend as the basis, many different settings 
and worlds are possible – all it takes is imagination.

New to Roleplaying?

Although  Legend  is  by  no  means  an  overly  complex  game,  it  is  assumed  that  those  reading 
this  book  have  played  a  roleplaying  game  before  and  understand  the  key  concepts:  players 
control characters and a Referee or Games Master articulates the story and the action, as well 
as adjudicating the results. So, whilst advice for both players and Games Masters is included 
throughout these rules, in the form of examples, clearly explained rules and so forth, it is written 
from the standpoint of a certain degree of roleplaying familiarity and experience.

New to Legend?

The  Legend  rules  are  part  of  a  family  of  popular  percentile-based  systems  that  are  renowned 
for their ease of use and adaptability. Legend’s concepts and rules are easy to understand and 
implement with a series of unified mechanics underpinning the separate elements of character 
creation,  combat  and  magic.  Most  character  actions  are  based  around  a  percentile  skill  or 
ability with a roll equal to, or below, the value indicating success. Of course different rules and 
circumstances add a certain degree of sophistication and complexity but at its heart Legend is a 
very simple, logical system that can be grasped from a glance at the character sheet and a scan 
through these rules.

The  game’s  design  also  incorporates  new  thinking  that  complements  many  tried  and  tested 
mechanics. This approach offers players a vast degree of control over what their characters do and 
how they do it. Many of the choices and possibilities are subtle: players and Games Masters will find 
that, with a little thought and creativity, all manner of wonderful opportunities and complexities 
present  themselves  whilst  still  being  supported  by  the  rules  framework.  Legend  is  completely 
adaptable and its intuitive rules mean that creating new rules or changing existing ones, whether to 
support an individual style of play or a particular setting, is easy to do and accommodate.

Forge your own Legend

These rules offer a detailed roleplaying framework and most players and Games Masters will 
use them as presented. However, nothing is cast in stone. If a rule does not suit you, change 
it  or  ignore  it.  Your  game  is  paramount.  It  is  impossible,  when  designing  a  game,  to  take 
into account every situation, notion or idea that will present itself during play. However, the 
framework is here to support informed decision making and to allow you to make Legend your 
own, unique rules set.

Experiment, improvise and adapt – that is the Legend way!

The Rules

The  next  chapter  begins  the  Legend  rules  with  Adventurer  Creation,  with  each  chapter 
introducing new concepts and themes. Read through each chapter, returning to it as necessary 
to clarify your understanding and referring to others as directed. Reference to future chapters 
is necessary but has been minimised as far as possible. However, it will be necessary to cross-
reference certain rules to establish their full impact and reach.

Throughout  the  book  we  have  provided  certain  optional  rules,  which  are  presented  in 
text  boxes. These  options  provide  a  different  slant  or  take  on  the  core  rules,  allowing 
Games Masters to tailor the rules to the game. As with any option, the choice is for you 
to make; or, as already mentioned, develop your own options that fit how your Legend 
should develop.

What Else Do I Need?

Legend  is  self-contained:  with  just  this  book  you  have  everything  needed  to  create  thrilling 
characters, adventures and quests. However additional Legend volumes, expanding on these core 
rules, may prove useful at a later stage – but are by no means essential to enjoying the game.

You are also directed to the Mongoose website for additional downloads, such as an Adventurer 
sheet and notes for converting RuneQuest II material to work with Legend.

adventurer creation

Legend characters are called Adventurers and this chapter explains how they are created. Every 
player in Legend creates and controls at least one Adventurer and it is through their Adventurer 
that  players  explore  the  game  world  around  them.  Adventurers,  as  their  name  suggests,  are 
seeking adventure, glory and heroism; they are prepared to engage in feats and endeavours that 
the common populace shy away from. Adventurers in Legend are heroes in the making; the ones 
who, in time, might become the subjects of stories, legends and myths of their own.

Adventurer Overview

Every Adventurer is comprised of certain game statistics that describe the character and what he 
is capable of. These statistics are as follows:

Characteristics  –  Seven  Characteristics  define  an  Adventurer:  Strength,  Constitution,  Size, 
Intelligence,  Power,  Dexterity  and  Charisma.  These  are  physical  and  mental  attributes  that 
define how strong, resilient, large, clever, quick and charismatic the Adventurer is. From these 
seven Characteristics all other game statistics flow.

Attributes  –  Derived  from  the  seven  Characteristics,  Attributes  are  secondary  statistics  that 
provide modifiers for certain actions or determine particular capabilities. Each is described in 
more  detail  later  in  this  chapter  but  the  attributes  are:  Combat  Actions,  Damage  Modifiers, 
Improvement Roll Modifiers, Hit Points, Magic Points, Strike Rank and Movement.

Skills – Skills are the engine room of a Legend Adventurer. Skills are particular talents, abilities, 
capabilities and professional skills that are shaped by an Adventurer’s culture, the profession he 
has chosen for himself and the way he has chosen to develop his interests and competencies. 
Skills are divided into Common and Advanced; Common skills are common to all Adventurers. 
Advanced  skills  differ  from  one  Adventurer  to  another,  reflecting  culture,  profession  and 
individual interests. However all skills work in the same way and have starting values derived 
from a combination, or multiple, of the seven Characteristics.

Community – No man is an island. Even before your Adventurer has set forth on his career 
as  a  potential  hero,  he  has  been  supported  by  family,  friends  and  allies.  He  may  also  have 
made valuable contacts, gained a few rivals and perhaps even some enemies. An Adventurer’s 
Community is a summary of those people he knows and may be able to call upon in the future 
– or who may call upon him.

Magic,  Weapons,  Equipment  and  so  on  –  In  addition  to  these  game  statistics  every 
Adventurer  has  additional  information  relating  to  what  magic  they  know  (if  any),  weapons 
they are experienced in using, equipment they carry and other pertinent information about the 
Adventurer in the here and now. These elements are introduced at the appropriate points in the 
Adventurer Creation process and later in this book.

There is a sample Legend Adventurer sheet on page 36. It has sections for all the information 
described here, and more, and is used during play as a record of your Adventurer’s current 
status. Various statistics – skills, for example, and Hit Points – will change frequently during 
the  game,  so  complete  the  Adventurer  sheet  in  pencil  and  keep  an  eraser  handy  to  make 
changes as they occur.

Permission  is  granted  to  make  copies  of  the  Legend  Adventurer  Sheet  for  personal  use.  A 
downloadable copy can be found at www.mongoosepublishing.com.

Characteristics

Every  Adventurer,  creature,  monster  and  Non-Player  Character  in  Legend  is  defined  by  the 
same  seven  Characteristics. These  are  the  building  blocks  for  every  other  aspect  of  a  Legend 
Adventurer,  describing  their  physical,  mental  and  spiritual  status. The  higher  the  figure,  for 
a Characteristic, the better. Low scores in Characteristics tend to mean weakness or ill-health 
– although much depends on the race that the Characteristics describe; some races have a low 
statistical range simply due to their natural physiology so a low score in a Characteristic might 
indicate a perfectly normal state of existence. A dwarf, for example, is always likely to have a 
lower SIZ than a human.

For your first Adventurer it is recommended that you create a human. Other races are available 
and because all creatures in Legend are defined in the same way, it means that just about any race 
or creature type can be created as an Adventurer. Humans, however, are the easiest to understand 
and the wisest choice for a new Adventurer. Human Characteristics range between 3 and 21 
although the upper limit for a starting Adventurer is likely to be 18. 

The Characteristics, and their abbreviations, are as follows:

Strength (STR)
Strength is a measure of an Adventurer’s raw muscle power. It acts as an indicator of how much 
someone  can  lift,  push  or  pull,  or  how  tightly  he  grasps  something.  Strength  determines  if 
an Adventurer can wield the heaviest hand weapons at full ability. It is also a component in 
calculating the Damage Modifier, which may increase the effect of physical attacks. Human STR 
cannot naturally exceed 21. If an Adventurer is reduced to zero Strength for any reason he lacks 
the  ability to  move  and  becomes bed-ridden until STR improves somehow (through natural 
healing or magic, for example).

Constitution (CON)
Constitution  measures  the  health  and  vitality  of  an  Adventurer  and  helps  to  determine  how 
much physical damage he can sustain. Adventurers with a high CON are likely to have more Hit 
Points meaning that they can soak-up more damage during combat. CON also determines how 
long it takes before an Adventurer starts to feel the effects of fatigue and weariness. Human CON 
cannot naturally exceed 21. If CON is reduced to zero the Adventurer dies.

Size (SIZ)
Size represents the average of an Adventurer’s mass. SIZ determines if an Adventurer can see over 
something, or fit through a small opening. SIZ also helps calculate the Adventurer’s Hit Points 
and damage bonus. Human SIZ cannot naturally be higher than 21. If SIZ is reduced to zero it 
results in death.

6
186.204.39.123

Intelligence (INT)
INT  represents  an  Adventurer’s  capacity  for  learning,  rationalising  and  analysis.  It  is  less  a 
measure of cleverness and more how the Adventurer applies what he knows either practically or 
analytically. INT affects many other game statistics and is important if the Adventurer is to be a 
competent magician. Human INT cannot naturally exceed 21. If, somehow, INT reaches zero, 
then the Adventurer is reduced to a witless, drooling idiot until INT is restored in some form.

INT  is  also  used  as  a  bonus  when  rolling  to  improve  skills.  See  the  Skills  chapter  for  more 
information.

Power (POW)
A somewhat abstract Characteristic, POW represents the force of both an Adventurer’s soul and 
his innate magical and spiritual presence. The more Power an Adventurer has, the greater their 
force  of  will,  confidence  and  capacity  for  magic.  Human  POW  cannot  naturally  exceed  21. 
POW can also be pledged to show devotion to the gods and in exchange for certain divine gifts 
or benefits. If POW is reduced to zero, the Adventurer usually dies – either completely sapped of 
his soul or his spirit has been taken into the gods’ care. However, depending on circumstances, 
Adventurer can exist with zero POW – but may have ceased to be human altogether.

Dexterity (DEX)
A measure of physical co-ordination, agility, suppleness and nimbleness, DEX is an important 
component in many physical skills. A decent DEX represents someone who is quick, keen of 
eye and fleet of movement. DEX determines how often in a fight an Adventurer can strike or 
defend  himself  –  an  important  consideration  if  he  is  outnumbered  or  the  skill  of  his  foes  is 
perhaps greater than his own. Human DEX cannot naturally exceed 21. If it is reduced to zero, 
the Adventurer is paralysed completely and cannot move in any way until DEX is recovered in 
some way (through healing or magic, for instance).

Charisma (CHA)
Charisma measures the force of personality. Adventurers with a high CHA have the ability to 
make friends easily, find themselves the focus of attention when it is needed (and sometimes 
when not) and persuade others to do things. Adventurers with a low CHA tend not to be noticed 
so  readily  or  have  a  hard  time  making  themselves  heard.  Charisma  is  not  a  measure  of  how 
beautiful or handsome an Adventurer is; it is, instead, an indicator of confidence and the ability 
to express one’s self. Human CHA has no upper limit although it is rare for it to exceed 21. If 
reduced to zero in any way, then the Adventurer has become completely uncommunicative and 
emotionless – a shell of a person.

CHA also influences the number of Improvement Rolls the Adventurer has when opportunities 
for skill and Characteristic improvements come around.

Determining Characteristics
An Adventurer’s Characteristics can be determined in one of several ways. The Games Master 
will decide which method is to be used.

Random Roll, In Order
Roll 3D6 for STR, CON, POW, DEX and CHA taking each dice roll result as it comes. For 
INT and SIZ roll 2D6+6 again, taking the rolled results.

186.204.39.123

7

Random Roll, Assign
Roll 3D6 five times and choose which result will be allocated to which Characteristic from STR, 
CON, POW, DEX and CHA. Next, roll 2D6+6 twice and decide which score with be allocated 
to INT and which to SIZ.

Characteristic Values – Optional Rule
In both Random Roll options Games Masters may wish to allow one, or both, of the following 
options:

•	 Re-roll any result of 6 or less.

•	 Allow  the  player  to  take  up  to  two  points  from  one  Characteristic  and  assign  them  to 
another. This swap may only be done once and neither SIZ nor INT can benefit from the 
swap. Furthermore, no Characteristic can be allowed to fall below 3 or exceed 18.

Points Build
Some players prefer not to roll dice to determine the Characteristics for their Adventurer, either 
because  they  do  not  like  leaving  their  Adventurer  to  chance  or  because  they  have  a  certain 
Adventurer  type and certain Characteristic values in mind. This option allows the players to 
design their Adventurer by assigning a number of points to their Characteristics from a pool of 
Characteristic Design Points.

•	

•	

Players have 80 Characteristic Design Points.

1 point in a Characteristic costs 1 Design Point.

•	 Characteristics cannot be lower than 6 or greater than 18.

•	

All Characteristic Design Points must be used in the design process. Points cannot be 
held over or used for anything else.

Using  the  Points  Build  system,  some  players  may  want  to  design  an  Adventurer  with 
Characteristics that exceed 18 and may go as high as 21. Games Masters may allow this as an 
option but if so, every Characteristic point above 18 costs 2 Characteristic Design Points to buy. 
So, if a player wanted to have an Adventurer with STR 20, it would cost 22 Design Points: 18 
points for STR 18 and then a further 4 points to raise STR 18 to STR 20.

Attributes

Attributes are a series of game statistics that are derived from the Adventurer’s Characteristic 
scores. Attributes represent capabilities that the Adventurer draws upon during the game to help 
resolve certain actions and outcomes. The attributes are as follows:

186.204.39.123

Alaric the Brave – An Example Adventurer

Throughout  Legend  we  will  follow  the  progress  of  Alaric  the  Brave:  from  initial  dice  rolls  right 
through to his first few adventures. We begin at the beginning: with a blank Adventurer sheet, a pencil 
and some dice.

The Games Master has decided that Adventurers in his campaign will be rolled using the Random 
Assign method. Alaric’s player must therefore roll 3D6 five times, noting the results, and 2D6+6 twice, 
again, noting the outcomes.

For the 3D6 rolls he gets the following: 10, 12, 13, 7 and 14. For the two 2D6+6 rolls he gets 16 
and 14.

Alaric’s player decides to allocate the results as follows: STR 12, CON 7, SIZ 14, INT 16, POW 14, 
DEX 13, CHA 10. 

Alaric is around the human average for Strength. He is no weight-lifter but neither is he a weakling. 
With CON 7, Alaric most likely suffers from coughs, sneezes and winter chills. He might have suffered 
an illness as a young child that has left his body weakened, or suffered some childhood injury that 
did not heal properly. SIZ 14 indicates Alaric is above average height. He stands taller than the other 
boys in his village and is stockier maybe. With INT 16 – Alaric is smart. He is observant, good at 
committing things to memory and has the ability to analyse problems and solve them quickly. His 
POW of 14 means his spirit is strong; with an above average Power score he will find working magic 
easier and will be noticeable to the gods who watch over his village. Alaric’s DEX 13 is above average, 
so he is pretty agile and fast. He is noted for accuracy in various village games, such as horseshoe 
throwing. Finally, CHA 10 is about average: Alaric is personable but not especially so. People know 
who Alaric is but he does not stand out from the crowd.

Age
Legend Adventurers start the game at 16+1D4 years of age, so between the ages of 17 and 20. 

Their  life  experiences  are  most  likely  confined  to  the  communities  of  their  births  and  they 
have  yet  to  experience  the  wider  world.  It  is  permissible  for  Adventurers  to  be  older  and 
more experienced than the novices the Adventurer Creation rules generate, and the rules for 
Experienced Adventurers are given on page 25 towards the end of this chapter. It is up to the 
Games Master to decide if players start the game with more experienced Adventurers or not.

Alaric’s Tale
Rolling 1D4 and adding the result to 16 we find that Alaric begins the game at 20 years of age.

Combat Actions
Adventurers  frequently  get  into  fights  –  from  bar-room  brawls,  through  duels  of  honour,  to 
tense melees with vile monsters and up to pitched battles in the midst of a war surrounded by 
thousands of comrades. 

186.204.39.123

Combat Actions, abbreviated to CA, are the number of times that an Adventurer can act to 
either attack an enemy, defend himself from attack or perform some other action during battle.

The number of CA an Adventurer has during a Combat Round (a period of time explained later 
in this book) is dependent on his DEX and INT. Add together DEX and INT and divide the 
result by 2 (rounding up); then consult the Combat Actions table.

Alaric’s Tale

+1

Alaric’s DEX of 13 and INT of 16, added together and divided by 2, gives him 3 CA. In a fight, Alaric 
is going to be confident and fast enough to act several times – an advantage over slower opponents.

Damage Modifier
Bigger and stronger Adventurers are able to hit harder than smaller, weaker ones. The Damage 
Modifier is a dice roll that is made in addition to the damage rolled for a weapon. For example, 
an Adventurer with a Damage Modifier of +1D4 rolls a four-sided dice alongside the damage for the 
sword he is using and adds it to the total.

To calculate the Adventurer’s Damage Modifier, add together the scores for STR and SIZ and 
look up the result on the Damage Modifier table.

11–15

Note that the Damage Modifier can be negative. If an Adventurer is physically small and weak 
he may not have the strength, leverage and reach to swing a weapon and strike to its full damage 
potential. Hence, a negative Damage Modifier is still rolled but the result is subtracted from the 
weapon’s damage total. If the Damage Modifier reduces a weapon’s damage to zero or a negative 
number, then no damage has been inflicted on that occasion.

Alaric’s Tale

Alaric’s STR 12 and SIZ 14 equal 26, which gives him +1D2 as a Damage Modifier. His above-
average SIZ means that Alaric can gain more leverage when swinging with a weapon, or place more 
weight behind it when thrusting, which improves its damage.

Hit Points
In Legend the body of every creature – human, animal and monster – is divided into a number 
of Hit Locations: each Hit Location has a number of Hit Points. Whenever a weapon strikes or 
a wound is taken, the place where it hits or where the wound affects is determined and damage 
applied to the Hit Points for that location.

Humans have seven Hit Locations: Head, Chest, Abdomen, Right Arm, Left Arm, Right Leg 
and Left Leg. The number of Hit Points each Hit Location has is based on CON and SIZ. Add 
the Adventurer’s CON and SIZ scores together and cross reference the result on the Hit Points 
per Location table.

Alaric’s Tale
With a CON of 7 and SIZ of 14 we know that Alaric is big but not necessarily in the best of shape. 
CON+SIZ gives a result of 21 which, cross referenced on the Hit Points per Location table gives the 
following Hit Points per location: Right and Left Leg: 5; Abdomen: 6; Chest: 7; Right and Left Arm: 
4; and Head: 5

Alaric’s bulk and body mass helps compensate for his somewhat flimsy constitution and Alaric has 
reasonable Hit Point scores in each location.

Improvement Roll Modifier
At the end of a Legend story, Adventurers are given the opportunity to improve their Adventurer’s 
skills and Characteristics. 

186.204.39.123

11

The CHA score provides either a penalty or a bonus to the number of Improvement Rolls an 
Adventurer has (see Adventurer Advancement starting on page 68); this reflects the relationship 
that the Adventurer has with his community, peers and colleagues, or, if CHA is particularly 
low, the difficulty of attempting to improve one’s capabilities without the assistance of others.

Improvement Roll Modifier
CHA

7 – 12

Alaric’s Tale
Alaric’s CHA of 10 means that he gains no Improvement Roll modifier when it comes to improving 
his  skills  and  Characteristics;  thus,  if  the  Games  Master  allocates  three  Improvement  Rolls  to  the 
Adventurers, Alaric takes advantage of all three. Had his CHA been higher though – say 15 – he 
would gain an additional Improvement Roll. Conversely, if his CHA was 6 or less, he would have one 
roll fewer than the number granted by the Games Master.

Magic Points
Magic Points represent a pool of points that are used to fuel spells and other magical effects. 
Usually the Magic Point total is equal to the Adventurer’s POW but this can change depending 
on whether or not an Adventurer has dedicated any of his POW to the worship of a god. This is 
explained in more detail later in the book, so, for now, Magic Points are equal to the Adventurer’s 
POW Characteristic.

Expended Magic Points normally recover after a sufficient period of rest.

Alaric’s Tale
With POW 14 Alaric has 14 Magic Points. Alaric is interested in becoming active in one of the 
religions of his community and will, in the future, dedicate some of his POW to his god to show his 
devotion and this will reduce his available Magic Points but, for now, his Magic Points are the same 
as his POW.

Movement
Human Adventurers have a base Movement rate of eight metres per Combat Round. Movement 
is described in more detail in the Game System chapter.

Strike Rank
How frequently an Adventurer acts in combat is defined by Combat Actions. How quickly he 
acts is defined by Strike Rank. Strike Rank is described in more detail in the Combat chapter 
but essentially, the higher an Adventurer’s Strike Rank the quicker he acts in a Combat Round.

12
186.204.39.123

Strike Rank is based on two components and is calculated as follows:

•	 Add together INT and DEX and divide the result by two (rounding up). An Adventurer’s 
speed  of  action  is  a  combination  ability  to  weigh-up  his  opponents  and  spot  potential 
openings and opportunities, and his overall speed and quickness of action. 

•	

Subtract the Strike Rank penalty incurred through wearing armour. This is described in 
more detail on page 125 but Adventurers who are wearing armour of any kind tend to have 
their movements restricted and have to handle the additional weight of their protection; this 
slows down the ability to react in a combat situation. The Strike Rank penalty for armour is 
the total amount of Armour Points the Adventurer is carrying, divided by 5 (rounded up).

Natural armour – such as a dragon’s scales – does not inflict a Strike Rank penalty. Similarly, 
armour provided by some magic spells does not inflict a Strike Rank penalty either.

Alaric’s Tale
Taking Alaric’s  INT of 16 and DEX of 13, adding them together and dividing by two gives him a 
Strike Rank of 15 (16+13 = 29/2 = 14.5, rounded up to 15).

Alaric has also inherited his grandfather’s leather jerkin, which covers his chest and abdomen and 
gives 2 Armour Points of protection to both Hit Locations. This means Alaric is carrying 4 points of 
armour and suffers a Strike Rank penalty because of it. 4 divided by 5 gives a result of 0.8 which is 
rounded up to 1. Alaric’s Strike Rank of 15 is therefore reduced to 14, reflecting the encumbrance of 
the leather armour.

Common Skills

Every Adventurer has a range of Common skills allowing him to perform a variety of actions 
with varying degrees of expertise. These are detailed more fully in the Skills chapter. At this point 
of Adventurer creation, players will only need to know the base values of each Common skill.

The basic score of each Common skill is determined by the sum of two Characteristics or a 
multiple of a single Characteristic. The value represents the Adventurer’s innate competence in a 
given area, along with any training he has received as part of his formative years. 

The Common Skills table shows how the basic values are calculated. The score represents the 
percentage chance of success for a skill; so, an Athletics score of 25 is expressed as 25%. How 
skill percentages work, and each Common Skill’s full description, is given in the Skills chapter.

Every Adventurer possesses the skills listed in the Common Skills table; however there are three 
other categories of skills that, whilst considered to be Common, are not automatically listed. 

Close  Combat  styles  and  Ranged  Combat  styles  are  special  skills  for  using  weapons.  Instead 
of having a single Close Combat or Ranged Combat skill, an Adventurer possesses a number 
of  different  Close  Combat  Styles  for  different  combinations  of  weapons.  For  example,  one 
Adventurer might be much more adept at using a Sword and Shield Close Combat Style than 
she is at wielding two shortswords. All Close Combat and Ranged Combat Styles start at the 
basic percentages listed in the following table but are tracked separately and do not automatically 
appear in the Common Skills section of the Legend Adventurer Sheet.

The existence of Common Magic in a game is up to the Games Master. In a high-fantasy setting, 
then every Adventurer may know a few useful spells. In a grittier, lower-magic game, then only 
those who have studied a form of magic can cast spells. Ask your Games Master if Common 
Magic is available in your game; if it is, it starts at the basic percentage listed.

Alaric’s Tale
Alaric’s player checks with the Games Master and learns that Common Magic is available to everyone 
in the setting. Alaric’s basic scores in each of the Common skills are therefore as follows:

Athletics 25%,Brawn 26%, Common Magic 24%, Culture (Own) 32%, Dance 23%, Driving 
27%, Evade 26%, Evaluate 26%, First Aid 29%, Influence 20%, Insight 30%, Lore (Regional) 
32%, Perception 30%, Persistence 28%, Ranged Combat 26%, Resilience 14%, Ride 27%, Sing 
24%, Sleight 23%, Stealth 29%, Swim 19%, Unarmed 25%.

Bear in mind that these are Alaric’s starting skill values reflecting his natural abilities and competencies: 
many of these areas will improve as the Adventurer Creation process continues.

186.204.39.123

Previous Experience
The  next  stage  of  creating  an  Adventurer  is  to  determine  their  Adventurer’s  previous 
experience. Each Adventurer starts the game between the ages of 17 and 20, and were most 
likely considered an adult at age 14 or 15, depending on the culture. Therefore the Adventurer 
has already had many years-worth of learning and experience that needs to be reflected in his 
skills: this includes skills developed within the Adventurer’s culture and those skills developed 
as part of professional training.

Previous experience therefore has three steps. First the player must pick the Adventurer’s Cultural 
Background, which is a reflection of the kind of cultural upbringing the Adventurer has had. 
This provides certain starting skill bonuses reflecting this upbringing.

Second, the player must pick a Profession and gain further skills and skill bonuses associated 
with that profession. The list of professions provided is considered appropriate to an Adventurer, 
however, it is entirely possible that an Adventurer might be a tailor, rather than a sailor and the 
appropriate skills for that kind of profession will have to be determined between the player and 
Games Master.

Third, the player determines and allocates the Adventurer’s Free Skill Points. These represent 
the remainder of the Adventurer’s experience outside of his upbringing and profession.

Cultural Background
Legend Adventurers come from one of four cultural backgrounds:

•	
Barbarian
•	 Civilised
•	 Nomad
•	
Primitive

Players  are free  to choose which Cultural Background their Adventurer  belongs to,  although 
Games Masters may insist that all Adventurers in a group come from the same one. This helps 
bring a group of Adventurers together, provides opportunities for friendships and community 
support to develop and provides a strong reason to explain why these individuals have come 
together. However it is not uncommon for Adventurers in the same group to come from very 
different Cultural Backgrounds and, where this is the case, a good variety of skills and magic 
gives the adventuring group flexibility and interest.

A description of each Cultural Background follows and includes a view of the culture from the 
perspective of one of its members. Included in the description is a list of skill bonuses and new 
skills appropriate to that culture. 

Players should apply the skill bonuses immediately to the Common skills on their Adventurer 
Sheet and add the additional new skills, known as Advanced Skills, to the appropriate section of 
the sheet. In many cases a Cultural Background lists a range of skills and invites the player to pick 
one, or more, that will gain a bonus: in this way players from the same Cultural Background can 
ensure that their Adventurers are different in the areas they have developed.

186.204.39.123

Barbarian
Tribal in nature, barbarians tend to shun civilisation, viewing those who live in towns and cities 
as weak and corrupt. They are much closer to nature and live as one with the land, hunting 
and tending to their farms far out in the wilderness. Most are adept in the use of weaponry as 
they must face many dangers throughout their lives. Many have extensive boating or animal 
handling/riding skills.

Civilised
Civilised Adventurers hail from an urban culture, which includes a village, town or city that is 
part of a wider network of similar settlements. In a civilised culture, education is becoming a 
right, not a privilege and the skills of the civilised Adventurer reflect this. However, he may be 
lacking in some of the skills that Adventurers from other backgrounds will depend upon for 
survival in a harsh world.

Nomad
Nomadic people are constantly on the move, with no home and hearth to call their own. They 
may move aimlessly about, or they may have several camps they move to and from throughout 
the year. With no crops and few herd animals of their own, nomads are adept at surviving on 
what they can quickly and easily scavenge from the land.

Nomad Adventurers 
choose two Combat 
Styles from the 
following and gain a 
+10% bonus to each:

Primitive
People of other cultures commonly dismiss primitive people as little more than animals. While 
mostly prejudice, it is true that primitive peoples have not mastered the technology that so many 
other cultures take for granted, as they still rely on flint spears and arrows and they are highly 
skilled at the basic knowledge needed for survival in the wild.

Alaric’s Tale
The campaign Alaric will be joining is set in a fantasy setting of the Game Master’s creation, called the 
Bleak Isle. The Games Master advises the players that he would like all the Adventurers to come from 
the same Cultural Background but that they can choose which background that will be. After some 
discussion the players decide that they will all play members of the same clan living in the area of the 
Bleak Isle known as the Gloamwood. This means that either Barbarian or Nomad would be a good 
fit for the region and the players settle on Barbarian. Alaric’s player enters this on his Adventurer sheet.

Running through the skill bonuses and options, Alaric’s adjusted Common skills now look like this:

Athletics 35% Brawn 31% Culture (Own) 62%, Lore (Regional) 62%, Perception 35%, Resilience 
24%, Ride 32%, Stealth 34%.

Alaric also gets to choose three Combat Styles gaining a +10% bonus to each. He chooses Spear and 
Shield, Dagger and Sling. Spear and Shield, and Dagger, are both Close Combat styles, whilst Sling 
is a Ranged Combat style. His Close Combat skills start at STR+DEX, which for Alaric is 25%, 
and Ranged Combat skills start at DEX x2, which is 26%. With his barbarian 10% bonus Alaric’s 
weapon skills are therefore Spear and Shield 35%, Dagger 35%, Sling 36%.

Alaric also gains three Advanced Skills. These need to be written onto his Adventurer Sheet as Advanced 
Skills vary from one character to another and are therefore not listed. He gains Language (Native) at 
its starting value and a +50% bonus; he also gains Survival at its starting percentage. Additionally 
he must choose one particular Advanced Skill from the Barbarian Cultural Background list: Alaric 
goes for Lore (The Thunderer). He knows that there are Thunder Worshippers in the setting and the 
idea of worshipping a storm god intrigues him. The Games Master agrees that this is a good choice of 
Advanced Skill and it is entered into his Adventurer Sheet along with the others.

Alaric checks on the Basic Values for his Advanced Skills and notes down the percentages. These are: 
Language (Native) (INT+CHA) 26%+50% = 76%; Survival (POW+CON) = 21%; Lore (The 
Thunderer) (INT x2) = 32%

Professions
Every Legend Adventurer starts the game having followed a profession. The profession he chooses 
may not necessarily be the one he continues to follow as he begins his adventuring life but it is 
the career he embarked on as part of the transition to adulthood and it further defines his skill 
development. The  professions  available  are  dependent  on  the  Cultural  Background;  in  some 
cultures the list of available professions is quite narrow because the needs of the community are 
straightforward and cultural traditions will push young adults along a certain path. In others, 
the list is more diverse, reflecting a more complex community and society with wider needs or 
cultural traditions that have diversified over the centuries.

Players should therefore examine the list of professions available to them based on the cultural 
background chosen in the previous stage of Previous Experience. Like the cultural background 
the profession offers bonuses to Common Skills and access to new Advanced Skills. These are 
applied to the Adventurer Sheet immediately.

186.204.39.123

19

Some professions also introduce Magical Skills. These Magical Skills are described in the Skills 
chapter, beginning on page 38.

If a profession duplicates an Advanced Skill gained through the cultural background (or the skill 
is offered as an Advanced Skill option and the player chooses it again) then the Adventurer gains 
a +10% bonus to it.

Free Skill Points
Every Legend Adventurer receives an additional 250 Skill Points to spend on their Adventurer. 
The player can add these Free Skill Points to his skills in the following ways:

•	 Add to a Common skill or Combat Style skill score.
•	 Add to an Advanced skill score, as long as the Adventurer already possesses the skill.
•	 Buy an Advanced skill. This costs 10 Free Skill Points and the Advanced skill starts at its 

basic Characteristic-derived score.

•	 Buy skills enabling Magic to be cast. If Common Magic is supported in the Legend setting 
, then the Adventurer will already have this as a Common skill; otherwise it will need to 
be bought as an Advanced Skill. The other magic enabling skills are Pact (Deity) and Lore 
(Specific Theology) – for Divine cult members or Manipulation and Sorcery (Grimoire) 
for Sorcerers.

Important Note: No single skill can benefit from more than 30 Free Skill Points. This means 
that an Advanced skill purchased with Free Skill Points cannot be increased by more than 20 
points.

For example, if Alaric, as part of his Free Skill Points, chose to buy Tracking (an Advanced Skill), 
it would cost 10 Skill Points to buy the skill at its basic, Characteristic value – in this case Alaric’s 
INT+CON, making it 23% – and Alaric would not be able to spend more than an additional 20 
points on it meaning that, if he chose to raise it, the maximum it could be would be 43%.

186.204.39.123

Alaric’s Tale
Coming from a barbarian culture, 
Alaric has a whole range of professions 
to choose from. Running through the 
list the one that appeals most is Warrior. 
Alaric’s player reasons that because Alaric 
is big and reasonably clever, his size and 
smarts will give him an advantage in 
combat. He also decides that his father 
was a warrior too and, in a barbarian 
culture, it is a case of Like Father, 
Like Son.

Choosing Warrior as his profession, 
Alaric gains +5% to Athletics, 
Brawn, Evade and Resilience. 
He also gains +10% to any two 
Combat Styles and, because he 
already has Spear and Shield and 
Dagger, he decides that he will 
improve these two Combat Styles. 
For his Advanced Skill, Alaric 
gains Lore (Tactics) – useful in 
cattle raids.

So, having determined cultural 
background and profession, Alaric’s 
skills are now:

Common: Athletics 40%, Brawn 
36%, Culture (Own) 62%, 
Dance 23%, Drive 27%, Evade 
31%, Evaluate 26%, First Aid 29%, 
Influence 20%, Insight 30%, Lore 
(Regional) 62%, Perception 35%, 
Persistence 28%, Resilience 24%, 
Ride 32%, Sing 24%, Sleight 
23%, Stealth 34%, Swim 19%, 
Unarmed 25%. 

Advanced: Language (Gloaming) 
76%, Lore (The Thunderer) 
32%, Lore (Tactics) 32%, 
Survival 21%

Combat Styles: Spear and Shield 
45%, Dagger 45%, Sling 36%

Alaric is now ready to move 
onto the third stage of Previous 
Experience.

Advanced Adventurers
It is perfectly acceptable for Adventurers to begin the game at a higher level than that used for 
creating basic, young adult Adventurers.
 
The following lists the ways a Games Master should alter Adventurer Creation in order to create 
Adventurers of an advanced experience level.
 
All  advanced  Adventurers  are  created  normally,  including  choosing  cultural  background  and 
profession,  until  the  time  comes  to  spend  Free  Skill  Points,  which  they  can  distribute  freely 
without limitation.

Community

The final stage of Adventurer Creation is to discover something of the Adventurer’s back-story. 
What has happened in the formative years of their life? Who are their family and friends? Has the 
Adventurer made any rivals or enemies? How well known is he or she? This section of Adventurer 
generation aims to answer these questions.

Families
All Adventurers have families. Family ties might still be close or severed long ago. The family 
might be large and rambling or small and close-knit. The family might have a reputation that 
has been a help or hindrance to the Adventurer, or its connections might be useful for all sorts 
of reasons now or in the future.

Roll 1D100 on each column of the Family Ties Table to determine the parental status, number 
of siblings and what the general, extended family structure is like.

For large families it is recommended that details be left deliberately vague. Part of the fun is 
introducing that roguish or well-connected uncle or cousin at strategic points in a campaign or 
scenario, and keeping family details at a high level allows for considerable flexibility in developing 
interesting and intriguing plot twists.

How well is the family connected? Is it important or run-of-the-mill? Is it well liked or does the 
family name carry with it a stigma? The following tables help decide how well known the family 
is and what kind of weight it carries at local, regional and national levels.

As  an  optional  stage  for  the  Adventurer’s  background,  are  they  married?  Roll  1D100  and 
compare it with the Adventurer’s Influence skill. If the result is equal to, or less than, Influence 
then  the  Adventurer  is  married,  should  the  player  wish  it.  If  the  result  is  higher  than  the 
Influence skill he is unmarried. How happily the Adventurer is married is up to the player to 
decide – similarly, children. If the Adventurer wants to have children by his spouse then he 
may roll 1D3–1, giving a result of between 0 and 2 children, about right for Adventurers in 
these kinds of cultures and starting ages. The age of any children will be, again, 1D3–1, with 
a result of 0 indicating a new-born.

Alaric’s Tale
On the Family Ties table, Alaric’s rolls are 96 (Single Mother), 59 (1D6 Siblings – result of 4; he has 
two brothers and two sisters, Alaric’s player decides) and 68 (1D8 relatives on each parent’s side – a 
total of 9 in all). It is decided that Alaric’s father died several years ago, when Alaric was no more 
than 10 years old, leaving his mother to raise him and his two brothers and two sisters with the help of 
their extensive family. Despite having lost his father, Alaric had plenty of male role-models in his life.

For Family Reputation the roll is 91 – Alaric’s extended family has an Excellent Reputation and this 
grants 1D3 (result 2) Allies or Contacts. Alaric chooses one of each and decides to detail them later. 
For Family Connections, the 1D100 roll is 33 – so Alaric’s family has reasonable connections within 
the community.

Alaric’s player decides that Alaric is unmarried – but has designs, to be explored further along in this 
part of Adventurer Creation.

Allies, Contacts, Enemies and Rivals
Through both his family and his personal dealings, an Adventurer may make acquaintances that 
will help or hinder him in the future. The Family Reputation and Family Connections tables will 
have determined if Allies, Contacts, Enemies or Rivals are present in the Adventurer’s life and, 
if so, how many are out there.

•	 Contacts  are  individuals  that  the  Adventurer  knows  and  has  had  friendly  dealings  with 

in the past. They have useful skills or positions and may be willing to aid the Adventurer.

•	 Allies are individuals that the Adventurer knows and has had friendly dealings with in the 

past. Allies will actively go out of their way to provide aid when asked for it. 

•	 Rivals are people who hate or oppose the Adventurer and will attempt to interfere or harass 

him. 

•	 Enemies are even worse than Rivals – a Rival will normally work within the law but an 

Enemy wants the Adventurer dead, imprisoned or otherwise doomed.

Note any Allies, Contacts, Enemies or Rivals on the Adventurer sheet along with a little detail 
on why they have this relationship with the Adventurer. Players can give as much detail as they 
wish, from the sketchy (Rival in the Clan) to the detailed (Harrick the Hairy is my Rival, because I 
disobeyed his orders while out hunting. He had me embarrassed in front of the clan elders, damn him! 
I’ll have my revenge on him one day!).

Other Adventurers can be Contacts, Allies or even Rivals for the purposes of the Connections 
rule (opposite) and may be implicated in Background Events, which follow.

Background Events
When an Adventurer is created he usually begins life as a young man but this does not mean 
his  previous  childhood  and  adolescence  was  lived  in  an  uneventful  bubble.  We  all  undergo 
life-shaping  experiences  that  define  who  we  are,  what  we  do  and  what  approach  we  have  to 
life. Games Masters are strongly recommended to spend time with their players developing the 
previous lives of the Adventurers. This does not need to be especially detailed and neither does it 
need to be too specific. Past experiences can be fleshed-out during the course of play or even be 
ignored all together. Establishing the background events to an Adventurer’s life can be extremely 
rewarding and provide the fuel for countless future adventures, if the Games Master desires it.

28
186.204.39.123

Alaric’s Tale
It was determined that Alaric has an Ally and a Contact. He decides to make the Ally his father’s 
brother (so Alaric’s uncle), Marius who is the chieftain of Alaric’s clan. The Contact is Selena, Marius’s 
daughter. The two were childhood friends and Alaric’s player decides that Alaric is in love with Selena 
but dare not admit his feelings until he has proven himself worthy.

Of course the Cultural Background of the Adventurer will have some say in what these previous 
experiences were, or, at the very least, determine where they took place. But the general nature 
of life experiences tends to be universal. The following table offers a wide selection of possible 
background events and some suggested game effects that the players and Games Master may 
wish  to  apply  to  the  Adventurers  during  Adventurer  Creation.  Every  Adventurer  should  roll 
once on the Background Events table; if the player is feeling very adventurous, then he may roll 
twice. If an event is thought to be restrictive or inappropriate for either the Adventurer or the 
campaign, it can either be ignore, or re-rolled.

Alaric’s Tale
For his Background Event Alaric’s 1D100 roll is 76 – Raised by a Guild or Military Order. The 
Games Master knows this is not appropriate given what we know of Alaric already and suggests a 
re-roll. The result this time is 56 – Major Wound; Alaric suffered a major wound as a child that left 
him with a scar across his left leg. Alaric’s player decides the wound was caused by a troll – the same 
troll that killed his father on a hunting expedition – and so now Alaric both fears and hates trolls: he 
wants revenge on the troll who murdered his father some day.

Connections
Why do parties of Adventurers come together? This is always an interesting question to answer 
when beginning a Legend campaign. Sometimes the Adventurers have a reason for being together 
–  coming  from  the  same  clan,  village  or  town;  drinking  in  the  same  tavern  when  monsters 
attack it; travelling in the same caravan. Yet perhaps the Adventurers have had some previous, 
significant history together, before play begins. This is where the Connections rule comes into 
Adventurer Creation and it involves at least two players and their Adventurers.

Alaric’s Tale
Two other Adventurers are being created alongside Alaric: Lilina and Thrace. All are from the same 
cultural background and from the same clan, living in the Gloamwood. The three players agree that 
Lilina and Thrace were all with Alaric when the troll attacked and murdered his father and gave 
Alaric the scar across his leg. The three of them have sworn an oath to find and kill the troll some day.

As this forms a connection with two other Adventurers, Alaric receives +10% to any two skills. He 
decides to improve Spear and Shield and Survival.

If both players agree, then any Background Event can involve another suitable Adventurer. Only 
one Adventurer needs to have rolled the specific event. If this is done, then both Adventurers gain 
a +10% bonus to any skill, Common, Advanced, Combat or Magical, gained so far. Adventurers 
may gain a maximum of two such bonuses from this rule and each connection must be with a 
different Adventurer.

Players are encouraged to explore and embellish upon a rolled event. For example, how could 
two different Adventurers both have a connection through the ‘Mute’ event? In this case, one 
Adventurer might act as the other’s interpreter, the two having grown up together and developed 
a form of sign language known only to them.

Final Stages

Adventurer Creation is nearly complete. All that remains is to name the Adventurer, if this has 
not already been done, determine what, if any, starting magic is available to him and buy the 
Adventurer’s beginning equipment using the money determined by Cultural Background. 

Names
Legend is a fantasy game and so names reflecting ancient cultures, popular fantasy fiction, TV 
and  movies  are  more  appropriate  than  contemporary  names. The  Cultural  Background  and 
Profession can be of help in naming an Adventurer; a civilised craftsman for example, might be 
Urwin the Potter; or a barbarian warrior might be Harrick Swiftaxe, son of Hendrick Redbeard. 
Give some thought to the Adventurer’s name – it will be important!

Hero Points
Adventurers begin with 2 Hero Points. 

Magic
There are several different types of magic available to Legend Adventurers and the types available 
from  the  start  of  play  depend  on  the  Cultural  Background,  the  Adventurer’s  Profession  and 
the availability of magic in the setting. Is magic commonplace, with every Adventurer having a 
smattering of spells learned as part of growing up, or is magic rare and strange, and only those 
Adventurers who studied under some arcane tutor possess spells? 

If Common Magic is freely available, then the spells that an Adventurer has at the start of the 
game depend on his Cultural Background. In such games every Adventurer begins with 6 points 
to spend on Common Magic spells, as described in the Common Magic chapter. The following 
limits apply to all Adventurers:

1 point is equal to 1 point of Magnitude (thus Bladesharp 2 would cost 2 points)

•	
•	 No spell can exceed Magnitude 3
•	

Spells must be chosen from the Cultural Background Magic table

Thus, Alaric could begin with up to six Magnitude 1 spells, three Magnitude 2 spells or two 
Magnitude 3 spells.

The  skills  used  for  Divine  Magic  and  Sorcery,  and  the  way  each  works,  are  detailed  in  the 
appropriate magical chapter and the Skills chapter

Magic Using Characters
Various  professions  –  Sorcerer,  Priest,  Shaman  and  Witch  –  begin  the  game  with  additional 
magic to Common Magic, as noted in the Magic column. The skills in this column reflect the 
higher types of magic these Professions use, such as Sorcery in the case of the Sorcerer.

Usually access to these forms of higher magic are granted through cult membership, as discussed 
in  the  Cults  chapter.  Players  choosing  these  Professions  may  therefore  be  considered  Pious 
Members of a divine cult or sorcery order, appropriate to the Adventurer’s background.

34
186.204.39.123

Equipment
The  Equipment  chapter  has  an  extensive  list  of  items  Adventurers  can  purchase  but  all 
Adventurers are assumed to begin the game with the following:

Some personal mementoes, good-luck charms, talismans or similar.

•	 Clothes they wear and a set of spares.
•	
•	 A week’s worth of food, either fresh or preserved.
•	 One weapon relevant to their weapon skills and culture.

If the Adventurer is a Noble by Profession then he also has one of the following:

•	 A set of armour with a maximum protection of 1D6 Armour Points.
•	 An additional weapon that is considered an heirloom.
•	 A mount appropriate to the culture (horse, camel, mule and so forth).
•	 A flask of very good wine.
•	 A piece of flashy-looking jewellery worth 1D6 x100 Silver Pieces.
•	 A set of very fine and expensive spare clothes suitable for a ball or banquet.

Note down the Size, Reach, Damage, attack skill, AP and HP of any weapons the Adventurer 
possesses. Also note down Unarmed Combat damage (1D3). 

Priests and Shamen: Gain Divine spells appropriate to their cult as defined in the Divine Magic 
chapter and based on how much POW is dedicated to the Pact with the god.

Sorcerers and Witches: Gain a Grimoire appropriate to their cult. If a pre-defined cult is being 
used then the spells contained in the Grimoire will be already determined. If a Grimoire needs 
to be developed from scratch, it will contain up to four Sorcery spells appropriate to the sorcery 
order’s nature and teachings.

Greater detail on these types of magic is found in the respective magic chapters.

Alaric’s Tale
Alaric is nearly complete. All that is left to do is decide his Common Magic. Alaric has 6 points 
to spend on Common Magic spells. He can only choose spells common to all cultures and those 
from the Barbarian column of the Cultural Background Magic table.

Alaric chooses Bladesharp 2 (meaning he can cast it at Magnitude 2), Thunder’s Voice (Magnitude 1), 
Heal 2 (Magnitude 2) and Vigour (Magnitude 1).

He casts all four of these spells at his Common Magic skill of 34%.

Equipment he will decide upon later but all the essential components for Alaric are in place. His 
completed Adventurer sheet is shown overleaf.

skills

Characteristics and Attributes define an Adventurer in terms of what he is – how strong, how fast, 
how much damage he deals with a well-aimed blow and so on. Skills define what an Adventurer 
can actually do. Ranging from how well an Adventurer can sneak past a guard and how well he 
can sculpt a statue, to his expertise with a sword. Skills quantify just how good an Adventurer is at 
specific tasks. The Adventurer Creation process has already introduced Common and Advanced 
skills; this chapter explores how skills, in general, work and how each skill works specifically.

Skill Tests

All skills have a starting value based on the sum of two Characteristics or a single Characteristic 
multiplied.  Cultural  Background,  Profession  and  Free  Skill  Points  raise  the  value  of  these 
skills. There is no upper limit to a skill; it can rise over 100% and even higher, indicating truly 
superhuman capabilities. How skills increase is detailed in Adventurer Advancement beginning 
on page 68.

When an Adventurer is called on to roll against a skill, he uses 1D100 and is attempting to roll 
equal to, or less than, his skill’s value. Achieving this means the skill is used successfully; if the 
1D100 roll is above the skill’s value, then the attempt has failed. 

Levels of Success and Failure
Whether  or  not  an  Adventurer  succeeds  or  fails  is  important  in  Legend  but  it  is  also  very 
important to see how well he succeeded or failed. For this reason levels of success are crucial to 
the game. The levels of success are (from best to worst):

•	 Critical Success
•	
•	
•	

Success (sometimes referred to as a Normal Success)
Failure
Fumble

When and When Not to Roll
Routine activities; those an Adventurer conducts time and again, under normal circumstances 
and expected pressures, do not require a roll for success. For example, riding a horse at a trot or 
gentle gallop across an open field, on a fine day, does not need a Ride test. Similarly a blacksmith 
making horse shoes with all the right tools and raw materials does not need to make a Craft 
(Blacksmith) roll.

Skill Tests  are  required  where  the  circumstances  are  out  of  the  ordinary  and/or  impart  some 
degree of stress, urgency or difficulty to the situation. Riding a horse at a gallop across an open 
field whilst being pursued by bandits is an instance where a Ride roll is called for. Attempting to 
make horseshoes with poor quality implements or a Skill Tests of resources is another.

38
186.204.39.123

The watchword is circumstance. The Games Master is the best judge as to whether the conditions 
and circumstances warrant a Skill Test. An Adventurer might not need to make a Perception test 
to hear a neighbouring conversation if the surroundings are relatively quiet. However, if there is 
a degree of background noise it will be necessary to roll to overhear accurately. If the people the 
Adventurer is eavesdropping on are whispering, then the Skill Test should incur a penalty for the 
circumstances, as outlined in Difficult and Haste.

Difficulty and Haste
Sometimes  it  will  be  necessary  to  make  a  Skill Test  because  success  or  failure  needs  to  be 
measured but the circumstances in which the skill is being used need to be taken into account. 
Circumstances can make a skill easier or harder to accomplish. For example, running up a 
steep hill to out-pace a murderous troll requires an Athletics Skill Test but the hill’s gradient 
means that the circumstances are harder than normal: the skill’s value is therefore modified to 
reflect this. Conversely hiding from a troll in a dark wood as night sets in, requires a Stealth 
Skill Test but the darkness makes hiding easier and so the skill’s value is modified accordingly. 
Similarly  the  amount  of  time  invested  in  using  a  skill  can  have  a  bearing  on  its  outcome. 
Rushing a job leads to errors whereas paying attention to detail and taking one’s time improves 
the chance of success.

Circumstances  are  graded  in  the  Difficulty  and  Haste  Modifiers  table.  These  modifiers  are 
applied temporarily to the skill’s value until the circumstances change.

The Difficulty Examples table on page 40 lists a few examples of Skill Tests that may occur 
in  a  Legend  game,  which  skills  would  be  used  and  what  difficulty  should  be  assigned  to 
them. Games Masters can use this table as a reference when creating their own Skill Tests 
for the Adventurers.

Rolling in Secret
It  is  a  great  deal  of  fun  rolling  dice  and  seeing  the  outcome.  Yet  there  are  going  to  be 
occasions  where  the  game  is  better  served  by  the  Games  Master  making  the  dice  roll  on 
behalf of the Adventurers and in secret, only revealing the result through game-play. For 
example, an Adventurer might be attempting to disguise himself to gain access to a thieves’ 
guild. The Adventurer is not aware of how convincing the disguise attempt has been until 
it is put into practical use, infiltrating the guild headquarters. If the Disguise Skill Test is 
made secretly by the Games Master then it becomes easier to build an air of suspense and 
tension as the Adventurer makes his attempts to bypass the guild’s members as he wanders 
into the guild buildings.

Not all tests should be made secretly by the Games Master. The best times to use secret rolls are 
in the following conditions:

•	 The Adventurer using the skill would have little or no way of knowing how successful 

his skill attempt has been until it is put to a practical test.

•	 The skill’s outcome is not immediate.
•	 Revealing  the  outcome  of  the  Skill Test  incrementally  will  create  a  better  sense  of 

tension.

Games Master dice rolls are, like all game tools, there to increase the enjoyment of the game for 
all, not to remove fun and enjoyment from the players. Used with discretion and at times where 
the outcome may not be immediate, certain or clear-cut, it can be a great way of introducing 
drama to a situation.

Critical Success

For many Skill Tests it is only necessary to determine whether one is successful or not. However, 
there may be certain cases where it is important to know how successful an Adventurer was – did 
he just skim by or did he achieve an incredible feat? This is determined by critical successes.

A roll of 01 is always a critical success.

If  the  Skill  Test  is  equal  to  or  less  than  10%  of  the  modified  skill  (rounded  up),  then  the 
Adventurer has scored a critical success. Note that the chance of a critical success relates to the 
modified skill total being used in the test, not the original ‘normal’ skill level. If an Adventurer 
is suffering a penalty to the Skill Test, it will reduce the Adventurer’s chance of scoring a critical 
success. Likewise if an Adventurer has a bonus to the Skill Test, it will increase the Adventurer’s 
critical success chance.

40
186.204.39.123

The actual result of a critical success varies from skill-to-skill and the skill descriptions note the 
effects  for  a  critical  success.  However  Games  Masters  are  quite  at  liberty  to  apply  additional 
results to fit the circumstances; for example:

•	 The task is completed sooner.
•	 The task is completed to a higher degree of expertise than normal.
•	 The task is completed with élan and style, generally impressing witnesses.
•	 The  Adventurer  gains  additional  information  or  insight  into  the  task  thanks  to  their 

brilliance.

If  a  critical  success  is  achieved  while  crafting  jewellery,  for  instance,  the  Games  Master  may 
decide that the finished article is of unusually high quality or that the item was completed faster 
than usual.

Fumbles

If one can succeed critically, one can also fail critically: a situation known as a fumble. A fumble 
occurs when:

•	 The modified skill being used is less than 100%, the result is 99 or 00.The modified skill 

being used is equal to, or more than 100%, 00 is rolled.

Very highly skilled Adventurers, or those in circumstances that make using a skill easier, fail less 
often than Adventurers with a lower degree of skill, or in situations where circumstances have 
made a skill more difficult to use.

Essentially, fumbling is the diametric opposite of critical success – the Adventurer has botched 
the attempt so badly he has experience a dramatic failure.

The precise effects of a fumble depend on the skill and the skill descriptions offer guidance on 
what effects a fumbling Adventurer experiences. However, as a rule, fumbles normally result in 
one of the following mishaps:

•	 The task takes twice as long to finish and is still a failure.
•	 The task produces a useless result that actually makes further actions more difficult.
•	 The  task  is  failed  spectacularly,  opening  the  Adventurer  up  to  derision  and  scorn  from 

witnesses.

•	 The Adventurer becomes impeded or even harmed by his failure.

For Example, Alaric is using his Dance skill to impress Selena, the chieftain’s daughter. Rolling 99 
when making his Dance skill roll, Alaric trips, stumbles and crashes into the musicians. The gathered 
clan hoots and jeers in derision and Selena’s father, Marius, glares angrily at the red-faced Alaric, 
upset that such a prize klutz would attempt such a complicated ritual dance in the first place. Alaric’s 
chances of impressing Selena have evaporated and, with it, he has angered her father…

Later, Alaric’s rival for Selena’s affections, Owain, attempts the same dance intending to capitalise 
on Alaric’s spectacular failure. Owain’s Dance skill is 92% but the Games Master decides to apply a 
+10% bonus reflecting the fact that the crowd is behind Owain’s attempt following Alaric’s fumble. 
Owain is therefore rolling against a modified skill of 102%. The dice roll is 00 – Owain also fumbles! 
The Games Master explains that Owain, swaggering around the great hall, fails to spot a spilled mug 

186.204.39.123

41

of mead, slips on it and executes a stumble every bit as bad as Alaric’s. At the high table Marius shakes 
his head sadly and Selena, trying to remain calm as the arrogant Owain climbs to his feet, winks a 
smile at Alaric. Alaric’s heart soars.

Weapon Skill Tests are as vulnerable to fumbles as any other test. A fumbled roll on a Bow Skill 
Test could result in a snapped bowstring, whilst fumbling a melee weapon attack test could mean 
the weapon has been clumsily broken. The Combat chapter provides more detailed guidance on 
combat fumble results.

Automatic Success and Failure
Whenever an Adventurer attempts to use a skill, there is always a chance he will succeed or fail, 
regardless of the level of his skill. Even a master swordsman with a sword skill of 190% can have 
a rock slip under his foot or have the sun hit his eyes at just the wrong moment. Likewise, the 
most unfit Adventurer might be able to climb a cliff in a lashing rainstorm at night, even if the 
modifiers would reduce his Athletics skill to below 0%.

•	 Any test result of 01 to 05 is an automatic success.
•	 Any test result of 96 to 00 is an automatic failure.

Note that the automatic success and failure rules do not apply if the Games Master has ruled that 
no test is required or possible.

Defaulting from an Advanced Skill

Note that while everyone has some facility with Common skills, Advanced skills are generally 
only possessed by specialists. Nevertheless, there will be times when an untrained Adventurer 
attempts to use an Advanced skill, even though they do not possess it.

In these cases, the Games Master may make one of two decisions. The first is that the task is 
simply impossible for the Adventurer. The Adventurer automatically fails the test.

Alternately, the Games Master may decide that a default Common skill may be used for that 
specific situation, as long as there is a logical link between the original Advanced skill and the 
substitute Common skill. However, such substituted Skill Tests normally suffer at least a –20% 
penalty, often more.

Levels of Skill

What is considered routine for an Adventurer with a skill of 60% may well be considered difficult 
for an Adventurer with only 25% in the same skill. So, the value of the skill forms one of the 
circumstances to take into consideration. The following table gathers skill values into a range of 
Competencies along with some guidance on what constitutes a routine task.

Augmenting Skills with Other Skills
There are occasions where one skill can help with another. For example, a merchant trying to 
get a good price on a rare vase might want to use his Lore (Pottery) skill to help his Influence 
or Commerce skill and thus get a good deal. In such situations it is permissible to allow the 
secondary skill to provide a bonus equal to its critical score to the primary skill. Thus, in the 
previous example, the merchant has Influence at 70% and Lore (Eastern Pottery) at 63%. The 
critical score for Lore (Eastern Pottery) is 7% making the merchant’s Influence 77% in total.

Basic techniques and principles are usually completed without

and may suffer a penalty depending on the nature of the task.
All  basic  and  some  advanced  techniques  are  possible  without 
a  Skill  Test  if  enough  time  is  available  and  the  necessary 
equipment is at hand. Some advanced techniques require a Skill 
Test and may suffer a penalty depending on the nature of the 
task.
Advanced tasks can be tackled even in the absence of one or two 
components necessary for success but, again, at a penalty.
Almost  all  techniques  are  known  and  can  be  undertaken 
with  confidence  even  when  the  right  components  have  been 
compromised.
The Adventurer is supremely confident in their execution of the 
skill and can readily improvise or resolve problems easily using 
effective shortcuts.

126+

Grand Master At this level the Adventurer is an absolute virtuoso of the skill 
and able to tackle, with confidence, any problem involving the 
skill’s  use. The  duration  taken  for  most  tasks  can  be  halved, 
if  necessary  (although  a  Grand  Master  knows  that  time  and 
patience are always key).

Only one skill at a time can be used to boost another skill and the skills must be complementary 
to  each  other  for  the  given  situation.  The  Games  Master  should  also  stipulate  when  an 
augmentation like this can be applied; it is never an automatic right.

Group Tests

In essence, this is a time-saving device for the Games Master. With a group test, the Games 
Master may make a single percentile roll to determine the success of a group of individuals all 
performing the same task, rather than rolling dozens or hundreds of individual die rolls. There 
are two kinds of group tests: team tests and sorting tests.

Team Tests
In a team test, success is cooperative; everyone reaps the benefit from a single success. If a squad 
of temple guards are all trying to search for an intruder in a crypt, then any successful Perception 
test will reveal him to all of them. If each guard rolls a Perception test, not only will things take 
longer but their mathematical chance of finding the intruder becomes quite high. The Games 
Master rolls once for the highest skill in the team (the highest Perception skill among the temple 
guards,  for  example)  and  if  the  roll  is  a  success,  everybody  succeeds.  If  the  roll  is  a  failure, 
everybody fails.

The Games Master may also use a ‘reverse team test’ in a situation where one failure can spell 
disaster. For example, if a gang of hunters are attempting to sneak up on a deer, any failed Stealth 
test will startle the quarry. In this case, the hunter with the lowest Stealth skill rolls a Stealth test. 
If he succeeds, everyone succeeds. If the roll is a failure, everybody fails.

186.204.39.123

43

Sorting Tests
In a sorting test, success is individual. For example, a group of bandits are attempting to outrun 
the  local  constabulary,  which  calls  for  opposed  Athletics  tests.  Some  of  the  bandits  have  an 
Athletics skill of 40%, some of 50% and some of 60%. The Games Master rolls a group test for 
the bandits, which results in a 49. Those with skills of 50% or more succeed, while the slower 
bandits begin to fall behind (unless the remainder of the bandits slow their progress to allow 
their fellows to keep up).

It  is  up  to  the  individual  Games  Master  when  to  move  from  multiple  individual  rolls  to 
a  group  test. The  former  is  certainly  more  authentic  but  the  more  individuals  involved  in 
the test, the longer it will take (and the more it will break up the flow of the game) to roll 
separately for each. 

Large Groups and Percentile Success
From time-to-time, the Games Master may need to determine the success of a large group of people 
performing the same task, in a situation in which there is no room for error. In this case, he may 
simply take the skill or Characteristic being employed and use that as the percentage of success.

For  Example:  A  group  of  100  brigands  is  attempting  to  swim  across  a  fast-flowing  river  a  scant 
distance  upstream  from  a  200  metre  waterfall,  an  activity  which  calls  for  an  Athletics  Skill Test. 
Because of the speed of the current and the nearby waterfall, a failed Skill Test for an individual will 
result in their being swept away by the current. Rather than rolling 100 Skill Tests, or rolling only one 
to determine whether all 100 brigands made it across, the Games Master may simply take the Athletics 
skill as the percentage of success. If the Games Master rules that all the brigands have an Athletics skill 
of 75, then 75 of them will make it to the other side of the river. The remaining 25 will be swept away 
over the falls, presumably wondering why none of them had the presence of mind to find a safer place 
to cross the river.

Assistance
Adventurers often have the opportunity to help one another during various tests. The Games 
Master is the final judge as to which tests can be helped with assistance and which require an 
Adventurer to make the test alone. For instance, if an Adventurer is attempting to lift a huge log 
out of a road, then clearly several others can help him in the Athletics test required. However, an 
Adventurer trying to break down a barred door may jam up the doorway too much for anyone 
else’s shoulder to fit. An Adventurer trying to recall the details of the local history of his own 
village cannot have strangers help him but several sages can piece together the history of the 
kingdom from their own memories.

Every assisting Adventurer adds his critical score to the primary Adventurer’s skill. Remember to 
apply any relative modifiers to the assisting Adventurer’s skill before determining the critical score.

The Games Master is the final arbiter of how many Adventurers may assist in any given test and 
how many attempts may be made in what period of time.

Opposed Skills

An opposed Skill Test occurs when one skill is actively resisted by another. For example a thief 
attempts to sneak past a wily palace guard who, being vigilant, is on the look-out for potential 
crooks.

44
186.204.39.123

In an opposed test both participants roll their respective skills. The winner of the test is the 
one who gains the higher level of success; if both participants have the same level of success, 
then the winner is the one with the higher dice roll within his skill range. (In the extremely 
unlikely situation that both Adventurers have exactly the same dice result and the same Level 
of Success, then the Adventurer with the highest skill wins. If it is still a draw, toss a coin to 
determine the winner!)

If both fail then a stalemate has occurred, forcing the opposed test to be rolled again at a later 
point.

For example: The cunning thief is attempting to sneak past the vigilant palace guard. The thief uses 
his Stealth skill, which is at 75%. The guard is opposing with his Perception skill of 60%. Dice are 
rolled. The thief rolls 71% and the guard rolls 59%. Both have succeeded but the thief has the higher 
roll within his skill range and sneaks past. Conversely, if the guard has rolled 59% and the thief had 
rolled 54%, again, both have succeeded but the guard has the higher roll and so spots the thief as he 
emerges from the shadows.

If both had failed then other circumstances would have intervened. In the previous example, for 
instance, a chambermaid might have entered the courtyard distracting the guard but interrupting 
the thief. Once she has passed, the opposed test can be attempted again.

Example: Alaric and Owain are engaged in a race. This calls for Athletics opposed skills. Alaric’s 
Athletics is 35% and Owain’s is 95%. The dice are rolled and Owain scores 94 – a very good roll since 
it is a high roll and less than his skill percentage. Alaric’s roll is 02 – a critical success and this beats 
Owain’s standard success. Alaric’s lucky burst of speed clearly overwhelmed Owain’s energy-conserving 
pace. Had Alaric rolled between 05 and 24, Owain would have won because whilst both Adventurers 
succeed, Owain’s is the higher roll whilst still being a normal success.

Opposed Skill Tests are extremely useful for many situations where the skills of one party need 
to be weighed directly against the skills of another. 

•	 Bargaining (Adventurers match Commerce and Commerce, or Commerce and Influence)
•	 Evading detection (Adventurer matches Stealth against the opponent’s Perception)
•	
•	
•	 Withstanding torture (Adventurer matches Resilience against Lore (Torture))
•	 Hiding or palming an object (Sleight against Perception)

Persuading (Adventurer matches Influence against Persistence)
Pursuits (participants match Athletics skills, or Evade against Athletics)

Opposed Skills Over 100%
During opposed tests, whichever participant has the highest mastered skill subtracts 100% from 
it and uses the remainder as a penalty to everyone in the contest. Thus the most skilled participant 
has a skill of 100% and everyone else is less than this. This has the benefit of introducing an 
increased chance of failure for the lesser skilled opponents in the contest; thus improving the 
chance of a better victory level.

For example, Mikhail the mercenary possesses a Stealth skill of 120%. Since he is the most experienced 
character he reduces all his opponents’ Perception skills by 20% and he himself is lowered to 100%.

The identification of who has the highest skill must be calculated after any other modifiers for 
circumstances have been applied.

186.204.39.123

Using Non-Combat Skills in Combat

The Skill Use Combat Action allows Adventurers to use their skills in combat situations whenever 
they deem it appropriate. For example, an Adventurer may be desperately trying to open a locked 
door to escape an oncoming enemy who is currently fighting his comrades. 

The actual Skill Tests made are performed as described previously. However, in combat it becomes 
important to know how long a skill takes to perform. Most will take only a single Combat Action 
and there are some specific examples listed in the skill descriptions later in this chapter.

The greatest problem with using a skill in combat is that it is quite possible to be interrupted in 
the middle of skill use by a random event (such as being struck by a sword). When an Adventurer 
must use a skill over a number of Combat Rounds, the final effect of the skill (and the test itself) 
will not normally take place until the end of the final Combat Action. In the meantime, the 
Adventurer must concentrate on the skill being used – he cannot suspend his skill use to initiate 
an attacking Combat Action, for instance.

Normally, an interruption to the skill user will result in either a penalty to the final test or the 
test automatically failing.

Common Skill Descriptions

Every Adventurer has access to all the Common skills during Adventurer Creation. These skills 
detail  the  most  common  actions  every  person  in  the  world  can  succeed  in  to  one  degree  or 
another. Each skill is derived from a combination of two Characteristics or a single Characteristic 
multiplied.

Athletics (STR+DEX)
This broad skill covers a range of athletic activities useful to Adventurers, including climbing, 
jumping and running.

If an Adventurer is wearing armour, the distances he can climb, run or jump are affected by 
the Armour Penalty. The section on Movement on page 92 of the Game System chapter details 
these effects. When using Athletics for the following specific actions the rate of Movement is 
determined by how it has been modified by the effects of any armour worn.

Climbing:  Given  enough  hand  and  footholds,  the  right  equipment  and  enough  time,  an 
Adventurer can climb any surface without the need for a test. Under normal circumstances, an 
Adventurer can climb or descend one quarter of his Movement as a Combat Action. 

•	 Climbing a rough surface (trees, steep hills and so on): The Armour Penalty is subtracted 
from  three  quarters  of  the  base  Movement  (6  metres  per  Combat  Action  for  human 
Adventurers). If the result is zero or less, they are too burdened by their armour to climb. 
Thus, our hero in his plate armour cannot climb as his Climbing Movement is 6–9 = –3.

•	 Climbing a sheer surface (walls, cliff faces and so on): The Armour Penalty is subtracted 
from the base Movement divided by two. As with climbing a rough surface, if the result is 
zero or less, the Adventurer cannot climb.

46
186.204.39.123

•	 Tests should be made for treacherous surfaces (such as sheer cliffs or wet surfaces) and if an 
Adventurer is trying to increase the rate of his ascent or descent. An Adventurer can double 
the rate of his modified Movement by taking a –20% penalty on his Athletics test.

A critical Climbing success allows the Adventurer to triple his Movement rate for the climb.

A fumbled Climbing roll means the Adventurer falls and cannot make an Acrobatics test (if he 
has the skill) to attempt to reduce the falling damage.

Jumping: In general, a successful Athletics test allows an Adventurer to jump up to twice his own 
height horizontally or up to half his own height vertically, if he has at least five metres to run first. 
If he is making a standing jump, these distances are halved. Leaps of over half an Adventurer’s 
maximum distance result in him falling prone on landing.

•	

•	

•	

If armoured, reduce the distance in metres the Adventurer can jump by the Armour Penalty 
divided by two. 

For every full 20% he possesses in this skill, the Adventurer may add an extra metre to a 
horizontal jump, or 20 centimetres to a vertical jump, if he has space to perform a run up.

For a critical success the Adventurer adds a further metre to his total distance and remains 
upright on landing. 

A  fumbled  Jump  roll  indicates  the  Adventurer  has  landed  awkwardly.  He  must  immediately 
make a Resilience test. If the Resilience test is successful he sustains 1 point of damage to each 
leg. If the Resilience test fails, then he sustains 1D4 points of damage to each leg.

Throwing:  Athletics  is  also  used  for  throwing  items  and  is  used  to  judge  the  accuracy  of  the 
Adventurer when throwing improvised objects, from small stones to bar stools. Weapons that are 
thrown use their own specific skill, such as Spear for javelins.

A  thrown  object  has  a  maximum  range  of  one  metre  for  every  point  the  Adventurer’s  STR 
exceeds  the  object’s  ENC. The  Athletics  roll  measures  the  Adventurer’s  accuracy  during  the 
throw and the Games Master may choose to treat this as a Ranged Combat attack, as described 
on page 140, if the situation warrants it.

Brawn (STR+SIZ)
Brawn  is  used  where  physical  force  (pushing,  pulling  and  lifting)  needs  to  be  implemented; 
forcing a jammed door, for instance, or pulling a cart free of a rut in the road.

An Adventurer can lift up his STR x1.5 in SIZ without making a Brawn roll. As a mass equivalent, 
one point of SIZ equals, roughly, 3.5 kilograms.

For SIZ and mass above this, the Adventurer needs to succeed in a Brawn roll and if successful 
he can lift up to three times his STR. If the roll is a critical success, then up to five times STR 
can be lifted.

If the Brawn roll is fumbled, the Adventurer risks injury: he must make a successful Resilience 
roll or sustain 1D3 points of damage to the Chest Hit Location (armour does not protect against 
this damage).

Common Magic (POW+CHA)
This skill relates to the magic commonly used by the Adventurer’s community and to which he will 
have had daily exposure whilst growing up, becoming familiar with a variety of spells and magical 
effects that are used in the daily tasks of his society. The spells of Common Magic are described in 
the Common Magic chapter and cover a wide variety of different effects, situations and scenarios.

If a Common Magic roll is a critical success, then the spell costs 1 less Magic Point (to a minimum 
of 1) to cast.

If the roll fumbles, then the Adventurer expends all the Magic Points for the spell’s Magnitude 
but the spell still fails.

Culture (Own) (INT x2)
The  Culture  skill  is  actually  several  separate  skills,  each  dealing  with  a  specific  culture. The 
Culture skill is distinct from Lore and Language skills, as it represents a person’s understanding 
of, and ability to heed, the behaviours, habits, customs and everyday rituals of a specific cultural 
group.  For  example,  someone  making  a  successful  test  in  Culture  (Nomads  of  the  Wastes) 
understands that it is considered good manners to remove all head-gear and footwear whenever 
entering a person’s tent; or knows that it is considered polite to pass the bread from left to right 
at a Waste-Nomad feast, whilst the fermented milk is always passed from right to left.

A critical success grants the Adventurer a unique understanding or insight into the workings of 
a particular cultural group, subgroup or type. The Games Master should reveal one or two key, 
previously unknown, facts about the culture to the Adventurer. Additionally the Adventurer may 
add the critical value of his Culture skill to any communication or personal credibility tests made 
in the immediate circumstances.

A fumble indicates the Adventurer has completely misunderstood a particular cultural practice, 
reference or social code, which causes an embarrassment that will be, at best, humiliating or, at 
worst, insulting. The Adventurer will be ostracised until suitable reparations are made.

Culture (Specific Culture) can also be learned as an Advanced skill when the Adventurer studies 
a different culture to his own.

Dance (DEX+CHA)
An Adventurer with this skill is accomplished at moving gracefully in time with music or other 
rhythm,  using  standardised  and  often  intricate  steps  and  movements.  A  successful  test  with 
Dance results in the audience or partner being pleased by the Adventurer’s performance.

On a critical success the dance is expressive, fluid and deeply affecting for all who witness it. 
Music  is  accompanied  by  perfect  movement  and  emotion. The  dance  is  as  persuasive  as  any 
Influence  test  and  can  be  used  as  such  in  situations  resting  on  communication  and  personal 
credibility. Alternatively any subsequent Influence test is given a bonus to the critical score of 
the Dance skill.

A fumbled dance is deeply humiliating to both the dancer and those who watch it. The dancer 
trips or stumbles. Passion is lost, the execution is clumsy and the dance fails to interpret the 
music in any shape or form. Any skills resting on communication and personal credibility will 
suffer a penalty at the discretssion of the Games Master.

48
186.204.39.123

Drive (DEX+POW)
If an Adventurer is driving a wagon, chariot or similar vehicle at not more than a walking pace 
across flat terrain, a Drive roll is not required. Rolls are needed when an Adventurer wants to 
do something out of the ordinary with a vehicle – traverse treacherous terrain, jump obstacles 
and so on.

A critical result either increases the vehicle’s movement by half again, if the skill is being used 
in a straightforward manner. If being used to perform a special manoeuvre, such as evading an 
enemy, a critical success allows half the Adventurer’s normal Drive skill to be used as a negative 
modifier against any applicable skills being used by pursuers for the rest of the Combat Round.

For example: Vadrus the Charioteer is being pursued by the war chariot of his enemy, Kortek. Kortek 
is hurling javelins with abandon and Vadrus declares he’s going to try to wheel his horses in a bid to 
evade the javelins. The Games Master calls for a Drive Skill Test from Vadrus’s player. Vadrus’s Drive 
skill is 70% and the dice roll is 06. This means that a –35% penalty is now applied to Kortek’s attack 
rolls as Vadrus’s chariot weaves and swerves.

A fumbled Drive roll indicates either a reduction in the vehicle’s speed by half or, if the vehicle 
is  trying  to  perform  a  special  manoeuvre,  it  becomes  unstable  and  overturns.  If  the  vehicle 
overturns all occupants need to make a successful Athletics test to leap clear of the wreckage or 
sustain 1D6 points of damage to a random location as the vehicle crashes.

Evade (DEX x 2)
Evade is used to escape from impending danger and can be used against ranged weapons (by 
dodging or diving out of the way), avoiding traps (triggered, sprung or otherwise), changing 
the engagement distance in combat and generally getting out of the way of a potential physical 
hazard.

For most tasks such as dodging traps or spells, the skill is opposed by the deadliness of the trap 
(i.e. the skill of its setter) or the casting skill of the sorcerer. Winning the opposed test allows 
the  user  to  completely  escape  harm.  On  the  other  hand,  if  they  lose  they  suffer  the  normal 
consequences.

For example, Alaric, investigating a murky old burial mound of (perhaps) Jade Throne Kingdom 
origin comes across a sarcophagus. He tries to open it and triggers the dart trap set 500 years ago, by 
the sarcophagus’s designers. The trap-setter’s skill at the time was 65%; Alaric’s Evade is 46% – he 
must pit this against the trap in an opposed roll. Alaric scores 45 and the Games Master rolls 31. Both 
are successful but Alaric wins the contest with the higher roll. The trap is sprung as Alaric lifts the 
sarcophagus lid and a hail of darts whirr towards his face: Alaric, prepared for such an eventuality, 
ducks deftly to one side and the darts strike the wall behind.

Since most quadruped or swimming creatures lack the Evade skill, they may substitute their 
Athletics skill for these situations instead. In a the same way, flying creatures can substitute their 
Fly skill for Evade when aloft.

If the Evade roll is fumbled, then the Adventurer has left himself open to the hazard and sustains 
its maximum damage.

186.204.39.123

49

Evaluate (INT+CHA)
Every Adventurer places a sense of worth on valuables, trades or propositions. The Evaluate skill enables 
the Adventurer to determine the value placed on something by others, effectively guessing its market 
value. With the Evaluate skill, the Adventurer can try to determine the value of specific objects.

Particularly common or obscure objects might give a bonus or penalty to the test but success 
will allow an Adventurer to guess the average monetary value of the object (normally guessing 
accurately to within 10% of its actual value).

For  a  critical  success  the  Adventurer  not  only  estimates  the  item’s  value  precisely,  he  also 
determines a secret or hitherto unknown fact about it that can be used to increase the item’s 
value by half again. 

For example, examining a rare alabaster vase, Matvalk the Merchant scores a critical Evaluate and 
correctly values the vase at 500 SP. He also notices a minute signature on the base meaning that the 
vase came from the Shah of Ashan’s renowned slave potter, Gustubus. This means the vase is highly 
sought after and could be sold for up to 750 SP.

If  the  Evaluate  fumbles,  not  only  does  the  Adventurer  completely  misjudge  the  value  of  the 
object, he devalues it by half again. Thus, if Matvalk in the previous example had fumbled his 
Evaluate roll, he would have valued the vase at only 250 SP.

First Aid (DEX+INT)
Living in a dangerous world, most Adventurers are adept at First Aid to one degree or another. 
First Aid is always applied to a specific location. See the First Aid Actions table. An Adventurer 
may apply First Aid to himself, though there is usually at least a –10% penalty owing to the 
awkwardness of applying the treatment. 

It normally takes 1D3 minutes to administer First Aid. Neither person can move and Combat 
Actions cannot be used for any other activity.

A location that has had any variation of First Aid administered to it cannot benefit from First Aid 
again until it has fully healed (it is restored to maximum Hit Points once more).

The use of First Aid requires suitable medical equipment such as bandages or salves. Makeshift 
medical equipment (such as bandages made from strips of cloth hastily torn from a dirty tunic) 
will bestow a –20% penalty on the test.

First Aid Actions
Injury
Impalement

Unconsciousness

Injured location

Serious Injury

Major Injury

Treatment
A  successful  First  Aid  test  removes  the  impaling  item  without  causing 
more damage to the victim.
A successful First Aid test can revive an Adventurer from unconsciousness, 
though drugged patients may inflict a penalty on the First Aid test.
A successful First Aid test on an injured location (but not one of 0 or less 
Hit Points) heals 1D3 Hit Points to that location.
A successful First Aid test on a location suffering from a Serious Injury 
heals one Hit Point to a location and restores it to functionality (in the case 
of a limb) or consciousness (in the case of the Abdomen, Chest or Head).
A successful First Aid test on a location suffering from a Major Injury does 
not restore the location’s Hit Points. This First Aid merely stabilises the 
patient so that they will not die from the injury.

50
186.204.39.123

A critical success in First Aid reduces the treatment time by half. If being used to treat an Injured 
location (see the First Aid Actions table), then 1D3+1 Hit Points are restored to the hurt location.

A fumbled First Aid attempt causes more harm than good: the Hit Location being treated suffers 
a further 1 point of damage.

Influence (CHA x 2)
Adventurers skilled in Influence find it easy to persuade others to their way of thinking, whether 
they are trying to persuade a king to send armies to fight a distant enemy, bribe a guard or merely 
get a merchant to sell them something at a reduced price.

Influence tests are normally opposed by the Perception, Persistence or Influence skill and are 
modified by how much an Adventurer is trying to change an opponent’s mind. For instance, 
getting a merchant to accept gems instead of coinage as payment is relatively easy, whilst trying 
to buy a sword for a 50% discount is not.

For a critical success the Adventurer’s efforts are incredibly persuasive, so much so that not only 
is the Adventurer successful in what he is trying to attain with his Influence skill but his next 
Influence test with the same person, no matter when it takes place, is at a bonus equal to the 
Adventurer’s CHA. 

For example, Matvalk the Merchant, having now determined the vase he is studying is worth 750 
SP tries to convince the seller that it is a worthless piece of tat. His Influence test is a critical success 
and Matvalk walks away with the vase for a trifling 200 SP. In his next Influence test with the same 
merchant, Matvalk’s Influence will be at a +14% bonus, for Matvalk’s CHA value.

A fumbled Influence roll indicates that not only does the Influence attempt fail; it also insults or 
offends the person being influenced. The reaction depends on the individual and the situation 
but at the very least it means that all future Influence tests against the same person will be at a 
–40% penalty.

Insight (INT+POW)
Insight is the ability to read a person’s verbal and non-verbal behaviours and signals to determine 
their motives and state of mind. Insight is used to decide if someone is telling a lie, or to predict 
how someone feels about a particular situation. It is distinct from the Perception skill, since it is 
used to detect subtle expressions of character and attitude, rather than tangible effects that can 
be assessed through general observation alone.

Sometimes it may be more effective for the Games Master to roll the outcome of an Adventurer’s 
Insight attempt, keeping the result of the roll secret and revealing information according to the 
degree of success (or failure) – as the results for a critical success or a fumble suggest.

For  a  critical  success  the  Adventurer  gains  the  ability  to  second  guess  how  the  person  under 
analysis  will  react  to  a  given  situation. The  Games  Master  should  offer  private  hints  to  the 
Adventurer regarding the person’s motivations and likely actions.

For a fumble, the Adventurer completely misjudges the analysed person’s motives and actions. 
The Games Master should offer the Adventurer a series of private, deliberately misleading hints 
regarding the person’s motivations and likely actions.

186.204.39.123

51

Alaric’s Tale
Matvalk  the  merchant  has  come  to  Alaric’s  village  to  sell  his  collection  of  rare  pottery.  Alaric  is 
suspicious of the merchant’s intentions, sensing that Matvalk believes the barbarians of the village to 
be unsophisticated half-wits. The Games Master makes an Insight roll for Alaric, concealing the result 
from Alaric’s player: the result is 03 – a critical success against Alaric’s Insight 45%. Taking Alaric’s 
player to one side the Games Master tells him that Matvalk, whilst making a convincing and sincere 
pretence  of  being  an  honest  trader  has  all  the  hallmarks  of  worshipping  the Trickster  god  –  never 
a good sign in a barbarian settlement. From now on Alaric will be on the look out for Matvalk’s 
cunning plans and schemes to make trouble. However, the Games Master does not tell Alaric’s player 
what the degree of success actually was for the Insight roll: Alaric will find this out for himself in the 
course of play but the Games Master will ensure that Alaric notices anything Matvalk does that reeks 
of Trickster worship.

Lore (INT x 2)
The Lore skill is actually many different skills, each of which must be improved separately. Each 
Lore skill defines an area of knowledge for the Adventurer and tests are made whenever a player 
wants to see if his Adventurer knows something about the subject at hand. This effectively allows 
the player to ask the Games Master direct questions if the test is successful.

Every Adventurer has, as a Common Skill, Lore (Regional). This is a measure of the Adventurer’s 
familiarity with the geography, flora and fauna of the area where he has grown up or spent the 
most significant amount of time prior to his adventuring career. Attempting to use this skill in 
unfamiliar circumstances will be at a disadvantage. For instance, an Adventurer raised in an arctic 
mountain range will suffer a penalty to Lore (Regional) skills in an equatorial desert.

For a critical success the Adventurer has gained some specific insight or made a startling discovery 
as a result of the critical success in the Lore skill. The Adventurer should be given one specific 
fact, relevant to the scenario or campaign that the he can then use as he sees fit.

A fumbled Lore test indicates a complete misunderstanding of the tenets of the Lore in question. 
In the case of Lore (Regional), for instance, this might mean mistaking a poisonous fungus for 
an edible one or placing the capital of a country 1,000 miles from its true position. 

Perception (INT+POW)
The Perception skill is used to represent the senses of the Adventurer when detecting objects or 
other persons. It covers listening for sounds, searching a room, hunting for a specific clue and so on.

On a critical success the Adventurer has picked-up on a nuance unseen, or unheard, by everyone 
else. A critical Perception test offers a single burst of enlightenment or recognition that helps 
avert disaster or completely reveals the concealed.

Fumbling a Perception test leads to the Adventurer being utterly oblivious to his surroundings. 
He is blissfully unaware of the impending ambush; he has not got a clue that a missing diamond 
ring layinglies a metre away from his left foot. Fumbling a Perception test in circumstances where 
the Adventurer is likely to face some threat, such as an attack, provides a bonus to the initial 
attacks of the opposing side when it launches its schemes.

52
186.204.39.123

Persistence (POW x 2)
Persistence is used whenever an Adventurer has his mental willpower called into question. This 
may be for anything as simple as concentrating on a task at hand amidst distraction, or it may be 
to resist the baleful effects of a mind-controlling spell.

A critical success in resisting magic means that no further spells cast by the opponent have any 
affect on the Adventurer for a number of Combat Actions equal to the Adventurer’s current 
Magic Points.

In  the  case  of  utilising  willpower  or  mental  fortitude,  a  critical  Persistence  roll  enables  the 
Adventurer to shrug-off any psychological effects of the situation and to remain undeterred by 
whatever it is he is experiencing.

Fumbling the Persistence test when resisting magic makes the psychological effect of the spell 
permanent until healed.

If  the  fumble  concerns  a  matter  of  willpower,  not  only  does  the  Adventurer  completely  fold 
under the pressure of the experience but becomes unable to conduct any other actions for 1D6 
minutes due to the sheer mental strain.

Alaric’s Tale
During  a  banquet  the  boastful  Owain  is  clearly  attempting  to  woo  the  dazzling  Selena.  Alaric, 
having consumed a few mugs of mead, watches the flirting with barely concealed jealousy. The Games 
Master calls for a Persistence roll, applying a –20% penalty for the mead Alaric has drunk. Alaric 
has Persistence 58% and rolls 52 – a failure with the penalty taken into account. Alaric can keep his 
jealousy under control no longer and decides to confront his rival.

Resilience (CON x 2)
Resilience is the physical counterpart to Persistence. The higher an Adventurer’s Resilience, the 
more likely he is to handle adverse physical conditions, such as weathering a vicious sandstorm, 
surviving in a drought or overcoming the effects of poison or disease. It is an important skill for 
assessing the reaction to injury, as outlined on page 11.

When resisting poisons or diseases a critical success allows the Adventurer to avoid making any 
further Resistance rolls against that specific dose or infection.

Fumbling when resisting means that the poison or disease has overwhelmed the Adventurer and 
that they automatically fail any further Resistance rolls against it.

Persistence and Resilience as Skills
Whilst  described  as  skills,  both  Persistence  and  Resilience  are  a  combination  of  natural 
capability,  personal  fortitude  and  training  to  deal  with  situations  involving  mental  and 
physical stress, including pain. All of us have untapped reserves of Persistence and Resilience; 
these skills measure the Adventurer’s ability to draw upon them to resist a variety of different 
pressures and conditions.

186.204.39.123

53

Optional Rule – Limits to Persistence and Resilience
There are limits to mental and physical endurance; barriers beyond which the mind and body 
cannot be pushed and surrender becomes inevitable. To represent this, Games Masters may wish 
to rule in their campaign that Persistence cannot exceed the value of the POW Characteristic 
multiplied by 5 and Resilience cannot exceed the CON Characteristic multiplied by five. The 
starting values for each skill are both calculated as normal but they are now no longer ‘limitless’ 
skills.  Of  course,  their  limits  can  be  extended  through  the  improvement  of  their  respective 
Characteristic scores.

Ride (DEX+POW)
If an Adventurer is riding a creature (with the help of whatever riding equipment is common 
to his Cultural Background) at not more than a walking pace across flat terrain, a Riding test 
will never be required. Tests are required when an Adventurer wants to do something out of the 
ordinary with a mount – traverse treacherous terrain, jump obstacles, ride bareback and so on.

Riding an unfamiliar species is at least a Difficult (–20%) test; riding a species in a different 
medium (a horseman riding a dolphin or a griffin, for example) is at least a Hard (–40%) test.

A critical Ride test allows the Adventurer to double the mount’s Movement for a number of 
Combat Rounds equal to the rider’s critical range for the Ride skill. Thus, an Adventurer with a 
Ride skill of 50% would double the movement rate for five Combat Rounds.

Fumbling a Ride test means the Adventurer must make an Athletics test to avoid losing control 
and being thrown from the mount (sustaining any falling damage as appropriate).

Sing (POW+CHA)
All Adventurers are gifted with the tools for singing (unless mute), unlike those who play other 
musical instruments. Few, however, develop the skill beyond their innate talent (or lack of). A 
successful test with this skill results in the audience being pleased – or even pleasantly surprised 
– by the Adventurer’s performance.

A critical Sing success can have one of several effects. If singing to earn money, increase by half 
again the amount earned due to the audience’s appreciation of the performance. If being used 
to impress someone, add the Sing’s critical score to the Adventurer’s Influence skill. Thus, an 
Adventurer with a Sing skill of 70% would add +7 to his Influence test.

If fumbled, then the song was truly terrible; off-key, out of tune and poorly performed. Halve the 
earnings and the singer suffers a penalty to future Influence rolls at the Games Master’s discretion 
and the circumstances of the fumble.

Sleight (DEX+CHA)
This skill is used to hide or take objects, without drawing undue attention. It is usually opposed 
by a Perception test if trying to avoid getting caught.

The object being manipulated can be of any size but particularly small or large objects will bestow 
bonuses or penalties to the test. For instance, hiding a dagger on a well-clothed person is relatively 
easy (+20%) but attempting to hide a war sword on the same person is far harder (–20%).

54
186.204.39.123

If the Sleight attempt is being made whilst others are around, perhaps with some vigilance, then 
the attempt is an opposed roll against the Perception of likely observers.

On a critical success the Adventurer has concealed or palmed the object so successfully that any 
subsequent attempts to locate it, using a Perception test, for example, are subject to a penalty 
(decided by the Games Master) plus the critical score of the Sleight skill.

On a fumble, not only is the item not concealed, it is dropped or otherwise exposed in full view 
of whoever is watching. If no one is actively watching for the deception, the sound of the item 
falling, or some other commotion immediately attracts their attention.

Stealth (DEX+INT)
The  Stealth  skill  is  used  whenever  an  Adventurer  attempts  to  personally  evade  detection  by 
another Adventurer. This usually happens when an Adventurer either tries to move quietly past 
an enemy, hide from one or perform a combination of both. Stealth tests are typically opposed 
by the Perception skill and are modified according to the situation.

On a critical success any subsequent attempts to locate the Adventurer (follow him, find him and 
so on) are at a penalty plus the critical score of the Stealth skill.

For a fumble the Adventurer stumbles and causes some form of commotion that immediately 
attracts  the  attention  of  anyone  in  the  vicinity.  Furthermore,  if  any  other  Adventurers  are 
attempting a Stealth test in the fumbling Adventurer’s company, they suffer a penalty to future 
Stealth rolls at the Games Master’s discretion and the circumstances of the fumble.

Swim (STR+CON)
Adventurers normally swim at half their usual Movement. Swim rolls are only required when 
conditions are less than ideal – swimming while heavily encumbered or in strong currents, for 
example. Failure of a Swim test while swimming will usually result in the Adventurer not moving 
at all, though repeated failures may result in drowning. See the Game System chapter on page 
76 for more details.

A critical Swim test allows the Adventurer to swim at his normal Movement rate.

On a fumble the Adventurer gets into difficulties due to the water conditions. He must make a 
successful Resilience test or sustain Suffocation damage as described on pages 76-78.

Unarmed (STR+DEX)
The Unarmed skill covers all trained and untrained unarmed combat from simple brawling to 
esoteric martial arts. Punches, kicks, head-butts and all other Unarmed attacks do 1D3 points 
of damage.

If using Unarmed the Adventurer may choose to either strike to cause damage or initiate (or 
break) a grapple.

Advanced Skill Descriptions

Advanced skills are those that Adventurers are not expected to have automatically. These skills 
often require long and difficult training and Adventurers who possess any level of expertise in 
them often identify themselves according to their expertise. An Adventurer will not have access 
to many of these skills during Adventurer Creation but others can be learnt through experience.

Acrobatics (STR+DEX)
Acrobatics covers a range of entertainments, for things such as juggling or tightrope walking. It 
also includes gymnastics such as tumbling and recovering from falls. Acrobatics can be used in 
its own right as a performance to impress an audience; but can also provide a bonus to Athletics 
and Evade Skill Tests. If used in this way, it adds its critical range as a bonus to the base skill.

Normally,  an  Adventurer  can  move  at  half  his  base  speed  across  an  unstable  surface  without 
penalty. To move at his full rate requires an Acrobatics test. A successful Acrobatics test will also 
halve the damage suffered from falling.

A critical success allows the Adventurer to double his movement rate when performing a feat of 
balance or when negotiating an unstable surface. If falling, a critical success will reduce falling 
damage to a quarter.

A fumbled Acrobatics roll means that balance and agility has been lost catastrophically. Not only 
does the Adventurer fall, he falls awkwardly, sustaining the full damage from the fall! 

Art (POW+CHA)
This skill allows an Adventurer to create works of art. Like the Lore and Craft skills, it is actually a 
large number of skills grouped together under one heading. There are literally dozens of different 
artistic endeavours an Adventurer may pursue and each of them is its own individual skill. For 
instance, an Adventurer who wishes to take up the brush and palette would take Art (Painting).

A critical success indicates that the artwork produced is of stunning quality – worth half the 
standard value again of similar products. If being used as part of an Influence test, to impress 
a prospective client or ally perhaps, then the Influence test will receive a bonus plus the critical 
score for the Art skill.

Conversely a fumble means that the artwork is a disaster and worth only what recoverable raw 
materials  were  used  in  its  creation.  Such  artwork  cannot  be  used  to  influence  another  party, 
without causing insult.

Boating (STR+CON)
This covers small waterborne craft propelled manually by oars or paddles (sail-driven craft are 
used with the Shiphandling Advanced skill). Travelling across calm water does not usually require 
a test but adverse conditions such as currents and weather can bestow penalties.

A critical Boating success increases the Movement rate for the craft by half again.

If a Boating test is fumbled, the Adventurer should make an Athletics test. If the Athletics test 
succeeds then the Adventurer has lost an oar or the controlling device for the boat has been 

56
186.204.39.123

broken. Reduce the craft’s movement by half. If the Athletics test is a failure or fumble, then the 
boat is in danger of capsizing. All on board need to make either an Acrobatics or Athletics test 
(whichever is higher) to remain in the boat. Those that fail fall into the water.

Commerce (INT+CHA)
This  skill  is  used  to  secure  the  best  price  for  goods  being  either  bought  or  sold  and  it  can 
be opposed by another Commerce roll, with the victor securing the advantage. Commerce is 
more than just haggling or simple bargaining; it is concerned with negotiation, compromise, 
brinksmanship and knowledge of the strength (or weakness) of the market for what is being 
traded. Where highly complex commercial deals are being discussed, a succession of opposed 
Commerce rolls might be called for, with cumulative bonuses or penalties (no greater than +/–
10% at a time) applied to the winner or loser, simulating the ebb and flow of the negotiation 
before settlement is reached.

A critical success allows the Adventurer to secure the commodity or service at half its usual price 
(or selling it for double).

A fumble indicates that the commodity or service is secured at twice the price or sold for only 
half the value.

Courtesy (INT+CHA)
A noble court, from that of a minor lord to the grand palace of an emperor usually conducts 
its business, or communicates, in ways that would seem utterly alien to a commoner. With this 
skill, the Adventurer knows how to navigate the murky and treacherous waters of life amongst 
the nobility. He understands the subtleties and extravagances of courtly behaviour and can use 
them to his own advantage.

A critical success means the Adventurer has made a superb impression with his courteousness 
and gains a bonus, plus the critical value of his Courtesy skill, in any Influence or similar tests, 
made soon after the Courtesy skill.

A  fumble  causes  a  devastating  faux-pas.  The  Adventurer  is  prevented  from  performing  any 
subsequent Skill Tests involving communication or personal credibility, until reparations have 
been made.

Craft (DEX+INT)
Like  the  Lore  skill,  the  Craft  skill  is  actually  several  separate  skills  grouped  under  a  single 
heading. For example, Craft (Armourer), Craft (Carpenter), Craft (Torturer) and Craft (Potter) 
are all individual skills.

Craft skills are used to fashion and create various items and there are literally hundreds of different 
crafts in the world, from the mundane to the exotic. The following list is by no means exhaustive:

Armourer,  baker,  basketweaver,  blacksmith,  bowyer,  brewer,  butcher,  candlemaker,  carpenter, 
cartographer,  cobbler,  cook,  cooper,  fletcher,  joiner,  leatherworker,  mason,  painter,  potter,  sculptor, 
smith, tailor, torturer, weaver.

A critical success allows the item being crafted to be of superior quality, in terms of durability, 
value or utility (choose one area of excellence). In terms of durability, it has additional AP and 
HP, distributed as the Adventurer sees fit, equal to the critical score of the skill. For example, 
a weaponsmith who crafts an especially fine longsword using his skill of 81% can distribute 8 
additional points between the sword’s AP and HP. In terms of value, increase the item’s value 
by half again. In terms of utility, the item provides a bonus equal to its maker’s critical score to 
whichever skill the item is used for.

A fumbled roll halves the Armour and Hit Points of the item and reduces its value by half. 

Culture (Specific Culture) (INT x2)
Learning the ways of a Culture other than one’s own is an Advanced skill. However it works in 
precisely the same way as for the Culture (Own) Common Skill. See page 48.

Disguise (INT+CHA)
This skill is used to change an Adventurer’s appearance, imitate cultural accents and mannerisms, 
or  assume  a  different  persona.  It  is  usually  opposed  by  an  Insight  or  Perception  test  if  the 
Adventurer is trying to avoid being identified.

A Disguise test will often be modified by the materials an Adventurer has to hand. For instance, 
it  would  be  very  hard  to  disguise  an  Adventurer  as  a  royal  guardsman  if  he  has  no  uniform 
available, whereas an old and moulding cloak will go a long way to helping an Adventurer pull 
off a disguise as a beggar.

A  critical  success  indicates  that  the  disguise  is  completely  perfect. The  Adventurer  gains  the 
confidence of those being deceived and receives a bonus, plus the critical score in the Disguise 
skill, to any further Skill Tests relying upon the effectiveness of the disguise.

A fumble means the disguise is so unconvincingly executed as to be obvious. Even in a dark 
room, it fools no one.

Engineering (INT x2)
This skill is used to design, build, activate, repair, sabotage or disassemble large mechanisms, 
traps or constructs such as siege machines, city gates, drawbridges, mineshafts, sailing ships and 
so forth.

A critical success indicates that the quality of the engineering project is first rate in terms of its 
durability and utility. The project is completed ahead of time and budget.

A fumble means the results of the project are simply unusable or may have failed to materialise. 
Indeed, the initial attempts have failed so badly that it takes double the time to complete it, 
whereupon it fails or collapses!

Gambling (INT+POW)
The ability to understand and play games of chance, including calculating odds, keeping one’s 
composure under high stakes and noticing when someone is cheating or when a game has 
been rigged.

58
186.204.39.123

186.204.39.123

A critical success with gambling allows the Adventurer to win a game even if it has been rigged 
to the highest degree. In terms of calculating or assessing odds of success, the Adventurer will be 
infallibly accurate in his assessment.

If the result is a fumble, then the Adventurer has utterly misread the circumstances, signals and 
other indicators surrounding the game. He loses everything save the shirt on his back (unless he 
was stupid enough to stake that too).

Healing (INT+POW)
This includes a number of advanced cures and restorative abilities, including surgery, developing 
antidotes to poisons and remedying diseases. Use of this skill will always require a healer’s kit (see 
page 114). Each use of the Healing skill generally takes 1D3x10 minutes to perform.

Curing Diseases: A successful Healing test allows a patient under the effect of a disease to add a 
bonus to his next opposed Resilience versus Potency test to resist the disease, equal to the critical 
value of the skill.

Curing Poisons: A successful Healing test allows a patient under the effect of a poison to attempt a 
second opposed Resilience versus Potency test, with the patient gaining a bonus to his Resilience 
test equal to the critical value of the skill.

For a critical success in treating diseases and poisons, the patient gains a bonus to his Resilience 
test equal to the healer’s Healing skill divided by 5.

If the roll is fumbled, the remedy weakens the patient’s ability to fight the cause of the affliction; 
all Resilience tests are at –10% penalty.

Surgery: Surgery is the only way, other than magical healing, that an Adventurer may recover 
from a Major Wound. Once a successful First Aid test has been made to stabilise a Major Wound 
(see page 50), a successful Healing test can attempt to set broken bones, stitch flesh together and 
restore the location so that it is on the road to recovery. As long as the Healing test is a success, 
the stricken location will begin to heal normally (see Natural Healing on page 86).

Surgery can re-attach a severed limb but this will not make it usable once more.

Critical success in surgery indicates that the patient gains a Hit Point due to the superior quality 
of  the  healing.  Reattached  limbs  will  heal  at  half  the  normal  rate  described  under  Natural 
Healing on page 86.

If the roll is fumbled the affected location remains permanently maimed and never recovers any 
Hit Points.

Language (INT+CHA)
Like the Lore skill, the Language skill is actually several separate skills grouped under a single 
heading.  Language  (English),  Language  (German)  and  Language  (French)  are  all  individual 
skills.

60
186.204.39.123

Every Adventurer with a Language skill of 50% or more is fluent in that language, though they 
will likely bear an accent if it is not their native tongue.

Civilised cultures are more likely than other cultures to have developed literacy although this 
does not mean that every barbarian or nomad culture, for example, has no written form of its 
language. It is therefore up to the Games Master to decide if fluency in a language also includes 
the ability to read and write it, depending on the nature and circumstances of the campaign. If 
the Games Master wishes the literacy percentage of the Adventurer’s language may be higher or 
lower than the spoken skill, in which case an appropriate bonus or penalty can be applied to the 
base Language skill.

If the Adventurer scores a critical success he has achieved a superb grasp of the language. He gains 
a bonus equal to his Language critical score for any tests involving communication of personal 
credibility.

On  a  fumble  the  Adventurer  has  completely  misunderstood  or  mangled  the  nuances  of  the 
language. All immediate Skill Tests involving communication and personal credibility suffer a 
penalty.

Lore (INT x2)
This skill is used in the same way as the Lore skill described on page 52. The Advanced range of 
possibilities for this skill is limited only by a player’s imagination but a list of potential areas of 
Lore study are listed here:

Alchemy, art, astronomy, gambling, geography, heraldry, law, logistics, military tactics, mineral, 
philosophy, poisons, theology.

Mechanisms (DEX+INT)
This  covers  an  Adventurer’s  ability  to  both  assemble  and  disassemble  mechanical  devices, 
including  traps  and  locks.  Mechanisms  generally  involve  delicate  contraptions  with  small 
working parts, as opposed to Engineering, which deals with massive constructions.

Picking a lock or disassembling a trap usually takes at least one minute to perform, while larger 
devices will take longer. 

Usually, an Adventurer will simply make a Mechanisms test in order to succeed at assembling 
or disassembling a device, with appropriate bonuses or penalties decided upon by the Games 
Master. However, if a device has been designed to specifically resist attempts at disassembly, the 
Mechanisms test becomes opposed by the Mechanisms skill of the Adventurer who created it.

On a critical success the Adventurer achieves success in half the usual time and with flawless 
results.

On a fumble the mechanism is broken and requires the attention of its maker to fix properly.

186.204.39.123

61

Meditation (POW x2)
The use of Meditation helps to focus concentration and is psychically soothing. Meditation is a 
skill that must be learned either by study or practice. A successfully meditating Adventurer may 
recover lost Magic Points at twice the normal rate. Meditating Adventurers retain full awareness 
of their surroundings and may make Perception tests at no penalty.

On a critical success the Adventurer triples the rate of Magic Point recovery.

Fumbling increases the Adventurer’s Fatigue by one level as unwanted thoughts intrude on the 
psyche.

Oratory (POW+CHA)
This skill is used when addressing large groups of people, such as a priest addressing the faithful 
or  a  general  exhorting  his  troops  to  victory  on  the  eve  of  a  battle.  In  effect,  it  is  much  like 
Influence, save that it relies more upon emotional appeal than intellectual stimulation and is 
used for larger groups of people.

On a critical success the Adventurer wins over the audience completely and utterly, gaining their 
vociferous agreement. He gains a bonus equal to the critical score of his Oratory skill for all 
immediate tests concerning communication and personal credibility.

If  fumbled  the  Adventurer’s  arguments  come  across  as  shallow  and  ill-communicated  –  even 
insulting. He gains a penalty equal to the critical score of his Oratory skill for all immediate tests 
concerning communication and personal credibility.

Play Instrument (DEX+CHA)
Like  the  Lore  skill,  the Play Instrument skill is actually several separate skills grouped under 
a  single  heading.  Play  Instrument  (Dulcimer),  Play  Instrument  (Flute)  and  Play  Instrument 
(Spoons) are all individual skills. A successful test with this skill will result in the audience being 
pleased by the Adventurer’s performance.

On a critical success the music produced is of stunning emotional quality. If being used as part of 
an Influence test, to impress a prospective client or ally perhaps, then the Influence test receives 
a bonus of +40 plus the critical score for the Play Instrument skill.

For a fumble the music is discordant and unpleasant to listen to. If being used as part of an 
Influence test, to impress a prospective client or ally perhaps, then the Influence test receives a 
penalty appropriate to the circumstances.

Seduction (INT+CHA)
Seduction combines charm, flirtatiousness, tenacity and cunning. This skill allows the Adventurer 
to completely win-over the target of the seduction attempt using overt romantic or sexual signals, 
leading to the target becoming deeply enthralled to the Adventurer and willing to perform one 
suggested service or command. The target may try to resist a seduction attempt with an opposed 
Persistence test.

62
186.204.39.123

Shiphandling (INT+CON)
This skill is used in the same way as Boating but is instead applied to waterborne craft that are 
driven by sail or rows of oars.

A critical Shiphandling success increases the Movement rate for the craft by half again.

If the test is fumbled, reduce the craft’s Movement by half

Streetwise (POW+CHA)
In some ways, this skill could be considered the urban version of Survival. Rather than helping 
the Adventurer find food and water, however, this skill allows him to find other things he might 
need in an urban setting. Streetwise allows an Adventurer to find fences for stolen goods, black 
markets and general information. Such uses of Streetwise normally require a minimum of 1D4 
hours.

A critical success allows the Adventurer to find what he is looking for 1D2 hours, rather than 
usual 1D4.

A fumbled Streetwise means the Adventurer makes some mistake that causes insult or offence, 
attracting the attention of undesirables who may wish to cause him harm. The Games Master 
should decide on the specifics according to the circumstances.

Survival (POW+CON)
This is a broad skill, used whenever the Adventurer has to rely on his own wits to survive outside 
the comforts of civilisation.

One Survival test will be required every day that an Adventurer lacks either food, water or a safe 
place to sleep. Success indicates the Adventurer manages to find whatever he is lacking – failure 
means he will go without which, over several days, could result in very serious consequences. 
Survival tests are not used when the Adventurer is in a city or town.

Survival tests may be required in other circumstances as well, such as hunting or gathering food 
for other Adventurers or attempting to locate the best place in the local terrain to permit a group 
to rest for an extended period.

On a critical success the Adventurer has been able to weather the conditions for a number of days 
equal to half his critical score in Survival (rounded up) without needing to make any further tests 
against Resilience, for instance.

On a fumble the Adventurer has done something that causes immediate harm. A Resilience test 
is required immediately. If failed, the Adventurer suffers 1D3 points of damage to a random 
location and the Games Master should adjudicate the specifics according to the circumstances 
of the environment.

Teaching (INT+CHA)
The  Adventurer  is  skilled  in  the  instruction,  coaching  and  tutoring  of  others. The  skill  does 
not work in the same way as other skills. When teaching someone else the teacher’s skill acts 
as a bonus to the Improvement Roll for his pupil, as described in the section on Adventurer 
Advancement beginning on page 68.

186.204.39.123

63

Track (INT+CON)
With this skill an Adventurer can locate the tracks (footprints, disturbed vegetation and so on) of 
a specific creature and follow them. A test must be made to locate the trail and then again once 
every hour they are being followed. Modifiers will be imposed depending on what terrain the 
trail is across (following footprints in the sand is Easy while doing the same across hard cobbles is 
Formidable), how long ago the tracks were made and whether anything has been done to cover 
them (either deliberately or via the weather).

With a critical Track test the Adventurer will not need to make any further Track tests in pursuit 
of the quarry and is able to anticipate and follow the trail without difficulty.

For a fumble the trail is completely lost and cannot be recovered.

Magical Skills

The magical skills here are distinct from Common Magic and apply to the specific magical paths 
of Divine Magic and Sorcery. These styles use a combination of two skills to govern how magic 
works – both the power of spells and their casting. A more thorough explanation of how the 
skills work can be found in the respective magic chapters but a summary of each skill follows: 

Lore (Specific Theology) (INT+POW)
This is the knowledge and understanding of one’s cult or religion; its history, myths and context 
in the world. The skill allows the Adventurer to call upon miracles or magic from his deity and 
is used in casting Divine Spells (see the Divine Magic chapter).

Critical success – The Divine Spell is not lost when cast and can be cast again.

Fumble  –  The  spell  does  not  work  but  is  also  lost  and  must  be  regained  as  if  it  had  been 
successfully cast.

Pact (Specific Cult or Deity) (CHA + Dedicated POW)
This is a measure of one’s devotion to a Divine cult (see the Divine Magic chapter) and its object 
of veneration. The higher the Pact skill, the more dedicated the follower. Dedicating POW to 
a  Divine  cult  automatically  creates  the  Pact  at  a  base  percentage  equal  to:  CHA+Dedicated 
POW. It is not a measure of how much an Adventurer knows about the cult or god; that is still 
measured by the Lore (Specific Theology) skill. Pacts are further explained in the Cults chapter.

If a critical success is rolled when recovering Divine Spells, the Adventurer recovers all the Divine 
Spells associated with the Pact simultaneously

If the Pact roll is fumbled then any Divine Spells used cannot be recovered and the Adventurer, 
irrespective of his standing in the cult or church, must return to a shrine or temple to pray for 
their return.

Sorcery (Grimoire) (INT x2)
Sorcery (Grimoire) is a measure of a sorcerer’s knowledge and intimacy with a particular group 
of spells, collectively known as a Grimoire. This skill is the ability of the sorcerer to cast all spells 

64
186.204.39.123

known to a particular school or church of sorcery; i.e. those held within its Grimoire but also 
measures the depth of relationship and arcane standing the sorcerer has achieved within the order.

The sorcerer must have studied and memorised the spell to be cast; he cannot use the Sorcery 
skill to cast spells that are not in a grimoire he is familiar with, as represented by the skill. Even if 
a sorcerer possesses knowledge of several Grimoires, he is still limited to memorising a maximum 
number of spells (including those known from Common Magic) equal to his INT.

The scale of what can be affected by a spell is dependent on the skill in the Sorcery School. The 
higher the skill, the greater the effect or the target it can be used against. 

To cast a spell, the sorcerer must succeed in a test of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. If the spellcasting 
attempt is a critical success, the entire spell costs zero Magic Points irrespective of the number of 
manipulations the sorcerer is attempting.

If the spellcasting attempt is fumbled, then the spell does not work and the sorcerer loses the full 
Magic Point cost of the spell.

Manipulation (INT+POW)
The  Manipulation  skill  is  used  to  manipulate  the  components  of  Magnitude,  Combine, 
Duration, Range and Target. When manipulating a spell, the Adventurer must choose which of 
these components he is manipulating. 

Every 10% or fraction thereof of the Manipulation skill allows 1 point of Manipulation to be 
assigned to the manipulated component. Sorcerers therefore need to specify, at the moment of 
casting, how the points of their Manipulation skill will be used. For example: a sorcerer with 
Manipulation of 50% could place three points into Manipulate Duration and two into Range; 
or five into a single component. 

This skill is not rolled against when spellcasting. Its value merely limits how much the caster may 
manipulate a Sorcery spell. However, Sorcery spells cost as many Magic Points to cast, as the 
number of manipulation components applied to it; with a minimum cost of 1.

186.204.39.123

65

game system

This chapter provides a series of rules for different in-game circumstances that will face Legend 
Adventurers  and  Games  Masters  from  time-to-time.  Some  circumstances  might  be  one-offs; 
others will be more frequent.

Action and Time

Action  takes  place  in  several different timescales, according to the stage of the story  and  the 
nature of the action. A fight, for instance, takes place in Combat Rounds, a detailed timescale 
that allows the anatomy of the combat to be played through and its effects applied appropriately. 
However, other actions and activities not need to be measured in such a detailed way; searching 
a room, for example, might take several minutes and travelling between two towns might take 
days. Time is typically abstracted into useful scales that advance the Adventurers’ story, keep 
things moving and focus the attention on what is most important. In a fight, for instance, it 
is important to know who is hurt, where and how badly, so tracking time at a detailed level is 
crucial. However, for travelling between two towns, along a known road with few hazards it is 
simply enough to state ‘It takes you three days to get from A to B’.

Time Scales
The key timescales, and what actions and motion can be accomplished, are as follows: Combat 
Rounds, Local Time and Strategic Time.

Combat Rounds
Dealt with in more detail in the Combat chapter, a Combat Round represents five seconds of 
game time. In a Combat Round an Adventurer can:

1.  Act a number of times depending on his Combat Actions available.
2.  Move a distance, usually a number of metres, equal to his Movement score (see page 

92). 

Once a Combat Round finishes another might start depending on the state of the combatants, 
or time might shift to Local Time (see the following section) to handle things such as first aid 
or healing.

Although Combat Rounds are used primarily for measuring fights between Adventurers and their 
adversaries, Combat Rounds can be useful for measuring very detailed activities that require a blow-
by-blow resolution. For example, a chase between hunter and hunted can be measured in Combat 
Rounds, representing the twists and turns that happen very quickly during any tense pursuit. The 
circumstances and tension required will determine when Combat Rounds are used and the rules for 
action and movement within the Combat Round, as found on pages 125 to 152, should be used.

66
186.204.39.123

Local Time
Local Time is anything from a few minutes to a few hours (but not more than about six hours) 
and is used to generally measure specific activities, such as skill usage, that do not require the 
detailed  attention  of  a  Combat  Round  but  require  a  specific  concentration  of  effort  with  a 
definite end result. Picking a lock might take five minutes and this is a measure of Local Time. 
Observing the patrols made by teams of guards around a castle’s walls might require several hours 
but is still a measure of Local Time. Usually, in Local Time, the following occurs:

1.  The Adventurer states his intention (Local Time starts).
2.  The Games Master assigns how long this takes to accomplish.
3.  Any appropriate Skill Tests are made and the results noted.
4.  The  Games  Master  communicates  the  results  and  the  time  taken  in  step  2  passes 

(Local Time ends).

The sequence may then either continue in Local Time, move into Combat Rounds or even go 
into Strategic Time (see the following section).

Some examples of Local Time tasks and the typical time required are in given in the Local Time 
Table.

Local Time Table
Example Task
Attempt a Craft or Lore skill.

Attempt to influence, persuade, or seduce 
someone.
Attempt to sway a crowd through oratory.

Pick a lock.

Search a room thoroughly.

Observe, note and understand a person or 
group of people’s habits (through following 
them or observing from a distance).
Effect a functional repair on a piece of broken 
equipment, given the right tools and resources.
Read a scroll, parchment or several chapters of 
a book.

Pick up a trail and follow it using Tracking.

Build a makeshift shelter, raft or similar.
Forage for food, set snares and so forth.
Prepare and cook a carcass for eating.

Time
5 minutes to 10 days, depending on 
complexity, tools available and so forth.
5 minutes to 6 hours, depending on the 
nature of the person being worked on.
20 minutes to 6 hours, depending on the 
mood of the crowd.
1 minute to 1 hour, depending on the 
complexity of the lock.
5 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the 
room’s size.
1 hour to 6 hours.

1 hour to 6 hours, depending on the 
circumstances.
10 minutes to 3 hours, depending on the 
complexity of the language and subject 
matter.
2 minutes to 2 hours, depending on local 
conditions.
3 to 6 hours.
2 to 4 hours.
1 to 12 hours, depending on the SIZ of the 
carcass.

186.204.39.123

67

Strategic Time
Strategic Time is measured in days, weeks, months or even years. Detailed events within Strategic 
Time do not necessarily need to be described and routine tasks and activities that are generally 
covered using Local Time are abstracted and presumed to happen automatically and successfully 
(although this, again, depends on the circumstances).

Use Strategic Time for those periods where it is not necessary to know the detail, just the outcome 
– ‘You sail for 10 days and reach the port by dawn on the 11th day’. ‘You travel the moors for two 
days and spot the village in the distance on the third.’ ‘You spend a week studying the grimoire 
but are none the wiser at the end of it.’

Long distances and environmental factors may be important to Strategic Time and may also 
have an effect on Local Time and Combat Rounds. The Games Masters’ Chapter offers some 
additional guidance on weather conditions and their effects.

Most  of  the  time,  Strategic  Time  will  be  concerned  with  how  far  Adventurers  can  travel 
depending on the mode of transport used. The Strategic Time Travel Table offers examples for 
various conditions. The travel times assume a travelling day of around 10 hours with regular 
stops for rest, water and food. If Adventurers are desperate and need to increase the distances 
given in the Strategic Time Travel Table, then they can effectively double the distance travelled 
in the Strategic Time period but gain a level of Fatigue if a Hard (–40%) Resilience roll is not 
successfully made. Naturally an appropriate Skill Test (Drive, Ride, Athletics and so on) also 
needs to be made to double the distance covered, along with dealing with any hazards that might 
need to be resolved in Combat Rounds or Local Time.

Adventurer Advancement

Legend Adventurers begin the game as callow youths and, through time and game play, may 
develop into heroes. They do this by improving the Common and Advanced skills they have, 
learning new skills, studying magic, seeking the secrets of Heroic Abilities and by improving 
their Characteristics which, in turn, help other Attributes to improve.

Improvement Rolls
Skills and Characteristics are increased through the use of Improvement Rolls, which the Games 
Master awards at the close of a particular game session or point in a story. Improvement Rolls 
are not given at the end of every game session but are awarded when the action reaches a natural 
close and the Adventurers have time to rest, reflect and consolidate what they may have learned 
in the time just past.

68
186.204.39.123

Alaric’s Tale
Alaric, Lilina and Thrace have just completed an adventure that saw them sneak into the troll’s lair 
in search of evidence for the whereabouts of the troll who killed Alaric’s father. During play all three 
Adventurers acted heroically and cleverly to the challenges set before them and so, when they return 
to the village, cut, bruised and bloodied, but with important information, the Games Master awards 
each Adventurer four Improvement Rolls.

Later…

The game session included a debate held in the Chieftain’s hall that concerned the welfare of the entire 
clan. Throughout this important council Alaric, Lilina and Thrace were completely disinterested and 
contribute nothing to the proceedings. At the end of the session, the Games Master makes an award of 
only two Improvement Rolls explaining that the award would have been higher if the Adventurers had 
participated more and learned from their experience.

As a base, each Adventurer should receive three Improvement Rolls when the time comes for 
them to be awarded. This can be modified if the Adventurers performed particularly poorly or 
heroically and the Games Master should judge how the award should be made: a minimum of 
one and a maximum of five Improvement Rolls depending on how the Adventurers acquitted 
themselves.

Improvement Roll Modifier
Every  Adventurer  has  an  Improvement  Roll  Modifier,  based  on  the  CHA  Characteristic,  of 
between  –1  and  +1,  or  more.  This  represents  the  relationship  an  Adventurer  has  with  his 
community, peers and colleagues, who offer their services or advice, or, if CHA is particularly 
low, the difficulty of attempting to improve one’s capabilities without the assistance of others.

The number of Improvement Rolls an Adventurer has to spend is modified by the value of the 
Improvement Roll Modifier. So, in the case of Alaric, his Improvement Roll Modifier is zero. In 
the two examples given earlier Alaric would receive four and two Improvement Rolls respectively, 
as the Games Master has decided to allocate them.

Lilina, on the other hand, has CHA 16 and therefore an Improvement Roll Modifier of +1. 
Lilina is very confident in her personality and this is abstracted in her ability to seek advice, make 
use of friends, colleagues and others in her community and make the most of her experiences. In 
the two examples earlier she would gain five Improvement Rolls (instead of the four the Games 
Master awards) and three Improvement Rolls rather than two.

Conversely Thrace,  with  a  CHA  of  5,  is  a  somewhat  sullen  individual  who  tends  to  keep 
himself to himself, probably because he lacks confidence socially or because he is, genuinely, 
anti-social.  This  places  him  at  a  disadvantage  in  his  development  and  his  Improvement 
Roll  Modifier  of  –1means  that,  in  the  examples  from  earlier,  he  gains  only  three  and  one 
Improvement Rolls respectively.

Using Improvement Rolls
A player can choose to spend one Improvement Roll to attempt to increase one known skill.

186.204.39.123

69

•	

•	

•	

Select the skill to be increased and roll 1D100. Add the Adventurer’s INT Characteristic to 
the result of the 1D100 roll.
If this 1D100 result is greater than the skill’s current score, the skill increases by 1D4+1 
points.
If this 1D100 result is equal to or less than the skill’s current score, the skill only increases 
by one point.

Alaric’s Tale
Alaric wishes to increase his Athletics, which is currently at 35%. He practises the skill in earnest 
and then spends one Improvement Roll.

He rolls 1D100 and results in 29. However, he also adds his INT of 16 and this makes a result 
of 45. Since this is greater than the 35% of his current Athletics skill, it is improved by 1D4+1 
points. If the result of the 1D100 roll and the addition of his INT had been less than or equal to 
35, his Athletics skill would have increased by only one point.

Skills Above 100%
There is no limit to the score a skill can reach; a skill can reach 100% and exceed it. However, 
the more adept an Adventurer becomes at any particular skill, the more difficult it becomes for 
him to learn something about that skill he did not already know. Thus, as an Adventurer’s skill 
percentage climbs, it will become more difficult and time consuming for him to raise that skill.

•	

•	 When an Adventurer wants to improve a skill that exceeds 100%, he only needs to roll 
against a target value of 100. However, if his current skill is between 101–200% he only 
adds half his INT to the roll.
If the skill is 201–300% he only adds one quarter of his INT to the roll; and, between 
301–400% an eighth (and so forth).
If the Adventurer manages to roll over 100, with his INT bonus as outlined above, then 
the skill improves by 1d4+1 points. If the result is less than 100 then the Adventurer only 
gains 1 point, as usual.

•	

For example Jurgen, a master swordsman, has Sword and Shield at 153% and INT 16. To improve 
his Sword and Shield he rolls 1D100 and adds 8 (half his INT) to the result. The roll is 94 and 
Jurgen’s INT bonus takes the result to 102 meaning that Jurgen gains a 1D4+1 increase.

Years later, Jurgen’s Sword and Shield has reached a dizzying 203%. To increase it, Jurgen must roll 
1D100 and score 100 or more, adding only a quarter of his INT (4) to the roll. The 1D100 roll is 43 
and Jurgen’s INT bonus of 4 takes it 47 – nowhere near enough for the skill to increase by 1D4+1% 
and so it climbs to just 204%.

Learning New Skills through Improvement Rolls
An  Adventurer  can  learn  a  new  Advanced  Skill  through  spending  Improvement  Rolls.  Two 
Improvement Rolls give the Adventurer the Advanced skill at its basic Characteristic-derived score.

Some Advanced skills however, cannot be learned through simply spending Improvement Rolls. 
The following Advanced Skills can only be gained through training (see page 72).

•	 Teaching

Sorcery and Manipulation

Once  learned  with  the  assistance  of  a  teacher,  these  skills  then  become  improvable  using 
Improvement Rolls.

Improving Characteristics
Adventurers can  gradually improve their Characteristics, becoming more  intelligent,  stronger 
or dextrous over time. Characteristics improve at a much slower rate than skills but can have 
more of an effect on an Adventurer. The process of increasing a Characteristic through exercise is 
abstracted through spending Improvement Rolls in a similar way to improving a skill – however 
the  cost  to  do  so  is  far  higher.  Improving  a  Characteristic  by  one  point  costs  a  number  of 
Improvement Rolls equal to the Characteristic’s current value; hence, improving a Characteristic 
from 10 to 11 would cost 10 Improvement Rolls.

Improvement Rolls, when used to improve Characteristics can be stockpiled from one allocation 
to the next but the player must state that his Adventurer is using these stockpiled Improvement 
Rolls towards a Characteristic increase – and stipulate which Characteristic is to benefit.

For example, Thrace’s player, at the end of a story when the Games Master allocates Improvement 
Rolls says that he wants to increase his CHA 5 to CHA 6. It will cost him five Improvement Rolls 
to do this and he knows it will take time. Instead of using the two rolls he gains from the story to 
enhance skills, he puts them towards his CHA improvement instead. In the next Improvement Roll 
allocation he can again choose to put his Improvement Rolls towards increasing his CHA or use 
them for skill improvement.

Adventurers  can  contribute  some  or  all  of  their  Improvement  Rolls  towards  Characteristic 
improvement. In Thrace’s example he could contribute one Improvement Roll towards increasing 
his CHA and spend another on improving a skill. The choice is his.

When  a  Characteristic  increases,  all  skills  that  derive  their  base  scores  from  it  will  change 
accordingly,  as  will  the  Adventurer’s  Attributes  such  as  Combat  Actions,  Strike  Ranks  and 
Damage Modifier. See the summary of Characteristic Changes on pages 11-12.

Improving Skills Through Training
As well as using Improvement Rolls to increase skills, skills can also increase through dedicated 
training. For this to occur, the following conditions need to be met:

•	 The Adventurer has sufficient time to dedicate to training – usually a period of Downtime 

(see page 84).

•	 Access to a teacher or mentor, either one-to-one or via a school, academy or cult.
•	

Funds to pay for training.

186.204.39.123

71

An  Adventurer  cannot  continually  improve  a  skill  through  training:  after  increasing  a  skill 
by  training  his  next  improvement  needs  to  be  through  an  Improvement  Roll.  Once  that 
is accomplished, he can then improve that skill through training once more, if he meets the 
training conditions.

To achieve any skill increase the Adventurer must spend a week in training and not undertaking 
any other activities. At the end of the training period a 1D100 roll is made to see if the Adventurer 
has made any headway and, if so, the skill improves. The amount of the improvement depends 
on the Adventurer’s ability to learn and the teacher’s ability to teach. Both are explained here.

Teachers and Mentors
Two names for the same thing, anyone can act as a teacher or mentor as long as they have at least 
20% more in the skill being taught than the Adventurer.

Teachers also benefit from the Teaching Advanced Skill. Teaching is the ability to train, coach and 
mentor to best effect, ensuring the right conditions for learning and cementing the knowledge 
conveyed. The value of the Teaching skill provides a bonus to the skill increase for the student. 
If the teacher has Teaching, he adds the critical range of the Teaching skill (i.e., one 10th of the 
skill’s score) to the Adventurer’s increase – if the Adventurer successfully learns anything from 
the time in study.

The Teaching skill also confers two other benefits, as follows:

•	 The teacher can instruct an additional student for every 20% he has in Teaching. Thus, a 

teacher with Teaching 60% could teach four students simultaneously.

•	 The teacher can add one silver piece per 1% of Training skill to the standard training cost.

It is not necessary for a teacher to have the Teaching skill but it is clearly an advantage to the 
student if it is present.

Training Procedure
To attempt a skill improvement through training the Adventurer spends a week in full time study 
with his teacher or mentor. At the end of the week he makes a 1D100 roll and compares it to his 
current score in the skill. Only one skill at a time can be increased through training.

•	

•	

If the roll is less than the skill’s current score, the skill increases by 1%. The Adventurer has 
not made significant progress through study.

If the roll is equal to, or greater than, the skill’s current score, the skill increases by a number 
of points equal to the Adventurer’s INT divided by five (rounded up), plus the teacher’s 
Teaching critical range (if the teacher has the Teaching skill).

Learning New Advanced Skills Through Training
The  following  Advanced  Skills  can  only  be  learned  by  an  Adventurer  if  he  has  a  teacher  or 
mentor to teach him:

Alaric’s Tale
Alaric is keen to improve his Dance skill in order to impress Selina, the Chieftain’s daughter, at a 
forthcoming banquet. His Dance is 23%. Alaric approaches one of his aunts who has Dance 65% 
and Teaching at 50%. It will take a week to train Alaric how to dance without looking ungainly 
or awkward.

At the end of the week Alaric rolls 1D100 and scores 92. His Dance skill therefore increases by the 
following:

Alaric’s INT 16 divided by 5 = 4, plus;
His aunt’s Teaching critical range of 5 (50%/10)

Thus, after a week of hard effort and several crushed toes, Alaric has increased his Dance by a total of 
9% taking it to 32%. He is still no expert but is far less clumsy than he was. His aunt suggests that, in 
return for her time, Alaric should donate 50 Silver Pieces to the local temple, to show his appreciation.

Sorcery and Manipulation

It takes one month for the Adventurer to emerge with the Advanced Skill at its basic, Characteristic 
derived score. From that point on, the skill can then be improved through either Improvement 
Rolls or training.

The teacher of the skill must be a professional, i.e. know the skill at 50% or higher.

Learning a new Advanced Skill does not require a 1D100 roll to be successfully made; all that 
is necessary is the time and money needed for training. However, if the trainer has the Teaching 
skill, the time it takes to learn the new Advanced Skill is reduced by one day for every 10% he 
has in Teaching. Thus, in Alaric’s example, if his mentor in Lore (The Thunderer) has Teaching 
70%, Alaric would need only 21 days – three weeks – rather than 28 to learn the skill to its 
starting level.

Training Costs
The standard costs for training are based on the Adventurer’s current level in the skill and the trainer’s 
Teaching skill. The table of costs that follows is a guide only and assumes that the Adventurer 
is finding an independent teacher who will offer one-to-one training. Dedicated academies may 
charge more or less, depending on reputation and a discount might be offered (5% per additional 
student, as a guideline) if a teacher is able to train multiple students at the same time. Remember 
that the teacher can add an additional Silver Piece for every 1% of his Teaching skill:

Therefore, an Adventurer wanting to train in his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, currently at 74%, with 
a teacher who has Teach 85%, would spend 885 Silver Pieces for a week’s training.

If an Adventurer is a member of a cult or guild that offers training in certain skills related to 
its membership, then he often benefits from a discount on training costs. The cult or guild’s 
description will specify what skills it trains in, what teachers it has available and what discount 
is offered to members. The Training Costs Table is used as the base cost for the training, unless 
otherwise specified in the cult or guild’s description.

Ageing

The  march  of Time  is  inevitable.  Unless  an  Adventurer  is  the  lucky  beneficiary  of  age-halting 
magic, he will get older and the effects of age will tell upon the frame. In Legend the signs of ageing 
do not begin until the Adventurer reaches the age of 40. At that point, and for each year thereafter 
(the birthday perhaps, or an anniversary agreed between the Games Master and the player), the 
Adventurer should make two Skill Tests: one for Resilience and one for Persistence. Each test is at 
a penalty equal to the number of years over 40 the Adventurer has attained. Thus, a 50 year old 
Adventurer suffers a –10% penalty to the Resilience and Persistence tests. The tests are also further 
modified according to the Adventurer’s life experiences, as noted in the following table.

Life Experiences
Life Experience
Disease or Poisoning
Emotional trauma
Insanity
Major Wound
Resurrected from Death
Serious Wound

Persistence and Resilience Modifiers
–10% (Resilience)
–5% (Persistence)
–10% (Persistence)
–10% (Resilience)
–15% (Persistence and Resilience)
–5% (Resilience)

Each  different  life  experience  is  cumulative;  so  an  Adventurer  who  has  been  poisoned  and 
suffered a Major Wound incurs a –20% penalty to his Resilience and Persistence tests. However, 

74
186.204.39.123

the Adventurer does not suffer from accumulated penalties for the multiple occurrences of the 
same experience. Thus, even though an Adventurer may have suffered several Major Wounds, he 
only incurs a single –10% penalty.

If the Resilience and/or Persistence test is made successfully, the Adventurer does not incur any 
ageing effects that year. If either test fails, the Adventurer must roll on the appropriate, or both, 
columns  of  the  Adventurer  Ageing Table  to  determine  which  Characteristics  suffer  from  the 
effects of ageing that year.

Each Characteristic affected by ageing reduces by 1D2 points. These points can be recovered 
through  normal  Characteristic  improvement,  as  described  on  page  71,  representing  efforts 
made by the Adventurer to keep themselves trim and alert as they grow older. What specific 
debilitating effects arise as part of the ageing process are down to the players and Games Master 
to define. Reducing STR or DEX indicates the general wear and tear on the body, for instance, 
with creaking joints and a gradual loss of mobility. Reducing INT indicates that age is starting 
to play tricks on the mind and memory, whilst reducing CHA indicates that the Adventurer is 
getting craggier and more short-tempered, perhaps, as they get older.

Damage

Damage  comes  from  a  multitude  of  sources  and  the  following  rules  account  for  the  most 
common forms that Adventurers will face.

186.204.39.123

75

Acid
What  is  important  here  is  the  dilution  of  the  acid  more  than  its  type  or  source.  Acids  are 
therefore classified as being Weak, Strong or Concentrated. For game purposes Legend assumes 
that contact with the acid is significant or sustained, rather than just a droplet or two.

A splash or spray of acid lasts only for a single round before it ceases working. Immersion in a 
considerable volume of acid however, inflicts the damage every round until the victim or location 
is removed and treated.

Damage

Acid Type

Treatable With…
Water – the residual acid can be washed away by the victim 
if a source of water, or similar fluid, is available. It takes 
a minute of washing to remove the acid: whilst being 
washed away the acid does not inflict any further damage 
but the victim must focus on treating the affected location 
with water and cannot undertake any further actions. If 
he interrupts the washing process he continues to suffer 1 
point of damage per round until it can be completed.
First Aid skill – a successful First Aid roll is required to 
reduce the acid’s type from Strong to Weak; the victim 
continues to sustain damage from the acid whilst the First 
Aid treatment is being made. Thereafter the weak acid 
can be treated as noted previously. If the First Aid roll is a 
critical success, then the acid is neutralised without needing 
further attention.
Healing skill – a successful Healing roll is needed to reduce 
the acid’s type from Concentrated to Weak. Thereafter the 
weak acid can be treated as noted previously. If the Healing 
roll is a critical success, then the acid is neutralised without 
needing further attention.

Armour slows the effects of acid but does not stop it. An armoured location has its APs reduced by 
the acid’s damage until it reaches zero Hit Points, at which point the damage is then transferred 
to the Hit Location that it had been protecting. Armour reduced to zero AP is rendered useless 
as the acid burns through bindings, straps and joints.

Asphyxiation/Suffocation/Drowning
If prepared, Adventurers are able to hold their breath for a number of seconds equal to CON x5.

If  unprepared  (and  as  the  circumstances  are  too  varied  to  summarise,  Games  Masters  must 
determine  if  an  Adventurer  is  prepared,  or  able  to  prepare),  the  Adventurer  must  make  a 
Resilience roll successfully to be able to gasp enough air and retain it without panicking, for 
CON x1D4 seconds. If the Resilience roll fails and/or when the Adventurer reaches the point 
where he must struggle to breathe, then damage sustained through asphyxiation/suffocation or 
drowning is as follows:

76
186.204.39.123

186.204.39.123

Make a (further) Resilience roll.
•	
•	

If the roll is a critical success, the Adventurer takes no damage that round.
If the roll is successful, the Adventurer sustains 1D3 points of damage to the Chest that 
round.
If the roll fails, the Adventurer sustains 1D3 points of damage to the Chest and Head that 
round.
If the roll is fumbled, the Adventurer sustains 1D6 points of damage to the Chest and Head 
that round.

•	

•	

The process continues until the Adventurer is able to breathe normally again or they die.

Adventurers struggling for air can attempt to perform any appropriate skills that circumstances 
permit: Swim, for instance, or grapple with a foe holding them in a position where asphyxiation 
is occurring. However all such skill attempts are considered to be Hard (–40%).

Disease and Poison
Diseases and poisons take many different forms but for game purposes function in a similar 
way. First, the Potency of the disease or poison must be calculated. All diseases and poisons are 
rated for Potency between 10 and 100 (or higher). The Potency is then matched against the 
appropriate resisting skill (usually Resilience or Persistence) in an opposed test.

•	
•	

If the resisting skill is a success then the effects of the disease or poison are avoided.
If  the  resisting  skill  is  a  failure  then  the  effects  of  the  disease  or  poison  are  felt  for  the 
Duration.

Characteristics of Poisons and Diseases
Every disease or poison has a series of Characteristics that govern how it affects the target. The 
Characteristics are:

Application: How the poison or disease is administered:

Ingested – The disease or poison is ingested through either eating or drinking.
Inhaled – The disease or poison is inhaled through breathing or snorting.

•	
•	
•	 Contact – The disease or poison is absorbed through skin contact.
•	

Injected – The disease or poison must be injected directly into the body (via a needle, sting 
or some other direct means).

Onset time: The time prior to the effects taking hold. Poisons or diseases possessing multiple 
Conditions may have different onset times for each one.

Duration: The duration of the poison or disease’s Conditions

Resistance Time: When or how frequently the Adventurer needs to make a Resistance roll to 
counter the disease or poison’s effects.

Potency: The disease or poison’s Potency, rated between 10 and 100 (or higher).

Resistance: How the disease or poison is resisted – either Persistence or Resilience, usually, but 
another roll may be called for.

Conditions: Every poison or disease has one or more Conditions. These have specific effects as 
described in the Conditions table and if a victim fails to resist the poison or disease, he suffers all 
the Conditions described. See the Conditions table, following.

78
186.204.39.123

Agony 

Asphyxiation

Bleeding 

Blindness
Confusion
Contagious
Deafness

Antidote/Cure: If the Adventurer succumbs to the poison or disease’s Conditions, there is still 
a chance that an appropriate cure will mitigate the effects. If so, then the remedy will be noted 
here. Otherwise all non magical diseases and poisons can be alleviated by specific healing magic, 
such as the Cure Disease or Cure Poison spells.
 
Conditions Table
Condition
Effects
The victim is incapacitated with pain. The affected area, if a location, cannot 
be used for the poison’s duration. If the poison affects the whole body, the 
Adventurer cannot move save to crawl slowly and scream.
Victim  suffers  asphyxiation  –  he  collapses,  unable  to  breathe  and  is 
incapacitated. The rules for Asphyxiation, found on page 76, are used.
Victim suffers a further Hit Point of damage every hour, from each location 
currently  wounded,  or  from  internal  bleeding.  Internal  bleeding  generally 
applies damage to all Hit Locations simultaneously.
Victim becomes blind.
Victim cannot use any knowledge, communication or magic skill.
Victim can transfer the poison or disease by touch.
Victim loses his hearing.
Victim must make a Resistance roll. If the Resistance roll fails then the victim 
dies immediately. If the Resistance roll is successful then all Hit Locations are 
reduced to a negative equivalent of their starting value: the victim then has a 
number of minutes to live equal to his CON Characteristic. It requires either 
the Healing skill or appropriate disease or poison healing magic to stabilise 
the victim.
Victim’s vocal chords are paralysed, preventing verbal communication or the 
casting of spells.
Victim  gains  an  extra  level  of  Fatigue,  on  top  of  any  they  are  currently 
suffering from.
The victim’s body temperature fluctuates wildly – from hot to cold – and 
muscles ache. All skills are halved and the victim also suffers from nausea (see 
the Nausea entry).
Victim  experiences  delusions  and  cannot  differentiate  between  real  and 
imaginary experiences. His skills and abilities are unaffected but his ability to 
relate to the real world is seriously impaired and characterised by fear, panic, 
hatred and, in extreme circumstances, irrational violence. 
Victim suffers a permanent loss of one Hit Point in the location(s) affected, 
due to necrosis of the injured tissue.
Victim is driven to follow some compulsion; such as avoid water, paranoia, 
attack companions and so forth. The mania induced by the disease or poison 
will be noted in its description.
Victim cannot eat and must roll against his Resilience every time he performs 
a stressful physical action to avoid being physically sick. The sickness lasts for 
1D3 rounds during which he cannot act and, once it has ended, he suffers a 
level of Fatigue until rested.
Victim is unable to physically move.
Victim loses Magic Points based on its potency.
Victim loses consciousness for a period specified in the disease or poison’s 
description.  When  consciousness  is  regained  the  victim  suffers  a  level  of 
Fatigue.

Sample Diseases
These are samples of various diseases encountered during Legend play, to be used as they stand or 
as a template for Games Master designed infections.

Creeping Chills
Carried  by  the  dreaded,  chaos-tainted  beastmen,  Creeping  Chills  is  spread  by  skin  contact 
although the skin must be broken (through a wound, for instance) for the disease to take hold. 
Beastmen sometimes smear their weapons in their own blood, spittle or excrement all of which 
harbour the contagion. If contracted Creeping Chills takes 1D4 hours before its effects are felt. 
First, the victim feels a chilling numbness through his arms and legs, before this rapidly overtakes 
the whole body. As the chills spread, he is rendered partially incapacitated as per the following 
description.

Application: Contact
Onset time: 1D4 hours
Duration: 1D6+1 weeks
Resistance Time: Weekly. The first Resistance roll must be made at the end of the Onset Time, 
then weekly thereafter. Successfully resisting the disease allows the Adventurer to avoid suffering 
the Conditions until the next roll must be made. Thus victims of Creeping Chills often appear 
to recover, only to suffer a later relapse.
Potency: 50+ CON of Beastman carrying it.
Resistance: Resilience.
Conditions: Fever. If the Resistance roll fails the victim suffers shivering attacks, muscle ache 
and has all skills halved until the disease is cured. 
Antidote/Cure: Cure Disease spell. Creeping Chills is a magical disease, meaning that only the 
Cure Disease spell can cure it.

Rabies
Carried  by  certain  animals  and  transferred  by  a  successful  bite,  rabies  works  on  the  brain, 
inflaming  it  and  paralysing  the  throat.  Victims  begin  with  flu-like  symptoms  (muscle  pains, 
coughing, fever) but within a few days the disease moves into its far more painful – and invariably 
fatal – phase.

Application: Contact
Onset time: 2D6 weeks
Duration: 2D6 days
Resistance Time: One Resistance roll
Potency: 80
Resistance: Resilience.
Conditions: Hallucination, Mania (hydrophobia), Death. If the disease takes hold, the victim 
suffers increasingly acute and debilitating hallucinations. Halfway through the Duration, manic 
hydrophobia  automatically  sets-in  as  the  victim’s  throat  swells,  the  body  dehydrates  and  it 
becomes physically painful to swallow water. At the end of the Duration, the victim mercifully 
slips into a coma and dies.
Antidote/Cure: Cure Disease spell. Rabies is not a magical disease but its severity means there 
is no natural cure or antidote for it; healing magic is essential and must be administered prior to 
the conclusion of the disease.

80
186.204.39.123

Soul Palsy
Carried by certain supernatural creatures, Soul Palsy deliberately targets the victim’s soul, eroding 
Magic  Points. The  disease  is  usually  contracted  through  inhaling  the  demonic  breath  of  the 
supernatural monster carrying it.

Application: Inhalation
Onset time: 1D4 days
Duration: 1D6 days
Resistance Time: Daily. The first Resistance roll must be made at the end of the Onset Time, 
then daily thereafter.
Potency: 65
Resistance: Persistence.
Conditions: Sapping. The Sapping condition saps 1D6 Magic Points if the daily Resistance roll 
is failed. 
Antidote/Cure:  Either  the  Cure  Disease  spell,  or  by  drinking  water  specially  Sanctified  by 
a  Priest  of  the  victim’s  cult. The  Sanctified  water  has  a  Potency  of  the  Priest’s  Magic  Points 
multiplied by five and it reduces the Potency of the Soul Palsy by this amount, either completely 
curing the disease or enabling the victim to better resist it.

Sample Poisons

Blade Venom
Blade  venom  comes  from  many  sources:  poisons  milked  from  venomous  creatures  and 
then treated further; toxic plants and herbs; or by alchemy perhaps. Typically blade venom 
is  a  sticky  paste  that  is  applied  to  a  blade  or  spear/arrow  head.  It  must  be  introduced 
through an open wound and once it takes effect, it inflicts a terrible burning pain in the 
injured location.

Application: Injection
Onset time: 1D3 Combat Rounds
Duration: 2D6 minutes
Resistance Time: One Resistance roll.
Potency: 55.
Resistance: Resilience.
Conditions: Agony. If the victim fails his Resistance roll the poisoned location is incapacitated 
with pain. The effect continues until the Duration is completed.
Antidote/Cure: Each specific blade venom usually has a counteracting agent, such as urine or 
yoghurt, which soothes the pain. If the cure is applied successfully before the end of the Onset 
time then the blade venom is completely counteracted. Successful use of the Healing skill will 
also neutralise the pain.

Potent Snake Venom
This venom is of the kind typically injected by a poisonous snake such as a cobra or similar. 
Fangs  are  used  to  inject  a  neurotoxin  in  a  dose  sufficient  to  kill  within  a  few  minutes. The 
potency of the venom is based on either the quantity injected or the concentration – meaning 
that small snakes with quite small venom glands can often introduce a small amount of venom 
that is every bit as harmful as a large dose from a larger snake.

186.204.39.123

81

Application: Injection
Onset time: Nausia after 1D3 minutes, Paralysis after 3D6 minutes, Asphyxiation at conclusion
Duration: 1 hour
Resistance Time: The victim must make a Resistance roll at the Onset Time of each stage of the 
poison. Failure indicates that Condition has taken effect.
Potency: 80
Resistance: Resilience
Conditions:  Nausea,  Paralysis,  Asphyxiation. The  venom  initially  causes  the  victim  to  start 
feeling nauseous if the first Resistance roll is failed. The location bitten then suffers paralysis if 
the second Resistance roll is failed. At the end of the Duration the victim must succeed in a final 
Resistance roll or suffer respiratory failure. 
Antidote/Cure: Anti-venom. Some cultures have perfected anti-venom remedies which have a 
Potency of 1D20+10. The anti-venom must be introduced with a successful First Aid or Healing 
roll and add their Potency as a bonus to the victim’s Resilience roll to fight the venom throughout 
its duration.

Sleeping Draught
Application: Ingestion
Onset time: 1D8 minutes
Duration: 2D6 hours
Resistance Time: Hourly. The first Resistance roll must be made at the end of the Onset Time, 
then hourly thereafter. Success indicates the victim has woken up but remains groggy for the 
remainder of the Duration.
Potency: 75.
Resistance: Resilience.
Conditions: Unconscious. If the victim fails the Resistance roll he falls into a deep sleep remaining 
unconscious until he succeeds in resisting the draught, or the Duration expires. The victim awakes 
feeling groggy and lethargic, gaining a level of fatigue in addition to any already suffered.
Antidote/Cure:  The  sap  of  the  foxglove  plant  can  protect  against  the  effects  of  a  sleeping 
draught if taken in advance of the poisoning. Otherwise, there is no method save magic that can 
counteract the effects.

Falls
Falling can happen for a number of reasons. Failed or fumbled Athletics rolls to climb or jump 
often result in falls and Knockback can easily knock an Adventurer off a precipice or over a 
parapet. An Adventurer that takes damage from a fall ends up prone. Armour Points do not 
reduce falling damage.

A creature of SIZ 8 to 9 treats the distance fallen as one metre less. A creature of SIZ 6 to 7 treats 
the distance fallen as three metres less. A creature of SIZ 4 to 5 treats the distance fallen as five 

82
186.204.39.123

metres less. A creature of SIZ 2 to 3 treats the distance fallen as eight metres less. A creature of 
SIZ 1 or less treats the distance fallen as 10 metres less.

As long as the Adventurer was not surprised, they may attempt an Acrobatics test to mitigate 
falling damage – a successful test allows the Adventurer to treat the fall as if it were two metres 
shorter than it actually is. In addition, as long as this test is a success and the Adventurer is not 
reduced to 0 Hit Points in a location due to the fall, the Adventurer lands relatively safely and 
is not prone.

Adventurers falling onto soft surfaces (such as thick moss or a hay stack) may treat the distance 
they  fall  as  halved  for  the  purposes  of  damage. The  Games  Master  will  decide  whether  this 
applies or not.

Adventurers falling onto damaging surfaces (such as pit spikes or a concrete floor bubbling 
with two inches of acid) will suffer the effects of the surface to all locations that are damaged 
in the fall.

Falling Objects
A falling object imparts an amount of damage based on its SIZ and the distance of the fall. An 
object imparts 1D6 damage for every six points of SIZ (or fraction thereof), plus an amount of 
damage equal to the Damage Taken column of the Falling Distance chart on page 82 – including 
any adjustments for objects of smaller size.

For example, an anvil with SIZ 10 inflicts 2D6 damage. If said anvil fell from a height of 10 metres, 
it would impart an additional 2D6 damage! If a small rock SIZ 1 was dropped from the same height, 
it would inflict 1D6 damage but would gain no extra damage from the fall.

Fire/Cold
Fire and intense heat can come from numerous sources, such as naked flames or super-heated 
metal.

An Adventurer normally takes damage from fire or heat to a specific Hit Location. However, if 
an Adventurer is immersed in the source of the damage (such as standing within a burning room 
or being burned at a stake), then all locations will suffer from the damage the fire causes. The 
amount of damage suffered from fire or heat will depend on its intensity, as shown on the Fire 
and Heat table. The damage from the heat source is applied every Combat Round until the heat 
source is extinguished or removed, or the Adventurer manages to escape from it.

something is cold enough to cause damage, it will cause damage according to its intensity, 
just like fire or heat.

Down Time

Down time is the period in between adventures when Adventurer spend their hours relaxing, 
training, carousing, researching, or simply getting on with their mundane lives. It is deliberately 
not a period that requires a Games Master to invest with any great detail but it can be interesting 
and fun to find out what Adventurers have been up to in their down time and, perhaps, use some 
of their activities either as the basis for a scenario or to form part of one.

Activities
The Adventurers can get-up to countless activities during Down Time and they do not need to 
be specific about them unless they are associated with improving the Adventurer in some way, or 
might have a useful implication for further adventures.

If  the  Games  Master  (and  players)  want  to  know  what  happens  to  their  adventurers  during 
Down Time and do not wish to fill in the blanks deliberately, here are some suggestions for 
common activities.

Odd Jobs
The Adventurer takes on paid, part-time work using his skills as an Adventurer. The work is 
generally non-hazardous and relatively poorly paid. Either choose an odd job or roll randomly. 
To see how much the Adventurer earns, either decide how many days are spent in the odd job, 
and multiply it by the Payment per Day figure, or roll 1D20 to randomly determine the number 
of days. 

To see how successful the Adventurer was in the job, roll a second 1D20. If the die roll is a 20, 
this indicates that the Adventurer was sacked from the job for some reason and pay was withheld 
(or worse). If a 1 is rolled, then the Adventurer performed a sterling service. Double the earnings 
from the work.

Cost of Living
When not adventuring, Adventurers have living expenses like everyone else; food, rent, taxes, 
socialising and so forth. Of course, how much an Adventurer chooses to spend depends almost 
entirely on what they have available to spend. Living luxuriously to one Adventurer may seem 
like border-line poverty to another, depending on what Adventurers are used to.

Use the following table as a general guide to living expenses. The terms used are relative to the 
amount of money the Adventurer has available: ‘luxury’ to someone with only a few silvers in 
their purse might be taking a bath once a week. To someone with several thousand, it might be 
taking a bath in ass’s milk every day.

The  amount  spent  on  Cost  of  Living  excludes  any  dues  necessary  to  cults  or  guilds  and  are 
exclusive of training costs. Neither are the costs of specific weapons, armour or other individual 
goods  used  in  adventuring  included.  As  a  period  of  Down Time  begins,  Adventurers  should 
declare  what  standard  of  living  they  intend  to  pursue  after  having  decided  on  training  and 
personal improvement activities and paid any dues to cults or other patrons. These costs should 
be deducted from each Adventurer’s personal wealth and the remainder used to determine the 
standard of living enjoyed for the remainder of the Down Time.

Encumbrance

Despite their most fervent prayers, Adventurers will be unable to carry every last weapon, piece 
of armour and treasure chest they discover. There is a limit to what an Adventurer can carry and 
those who exceed this limit will not be able to move very quickly.

Every piece of equipment in the Equipment chapter has an Encumbrance (ENC) score, though 
some items are too small or light to have an ENC score. Adventurers can usually ignore the 
effects on Encumbrance that these have unless they start carrying a lot of them – assume that 
an average of 20 such items will equal 1 ENC, so long as the Adventurer has a suitable means of 
carrying them, such as a sack or backpack.

An Adventurer can carry equipment with a total ENC that is less than or equal to his STR+SIZ 
without penalty. 

Overloading
An Adventurer carrying total ENC greater than his STR+SIZ is Overloaded. 

•	 Overloaded  Adventurers  suffer  a  –20%  penalty  to  all  tests  that  require  physical  actions, 
including Weapon  Skill Tests  and  most  tests  that  have  DEX  or  STR  as  a  Characteristic 
(some exceptions being Sleight and Mechanisms).

•	 Overloaded Adventurers have their Movement halved. They also suffer a –20% penalty to 

all Fatigue tests. 

Healing

Healing can come from a variety of sources: First Aid and Healing skills are obvious, as is magical 
healing in the form of spells: these healing forms are dealt with in their respective descriptions. 
However, Adventurers also heal naturally and the rate of natural healing is dependent on the 
Adventurer’s Resilience.

Natural Healing
The amount of Hit Points an Adventurer naturally regains is based on the Resilience value, as 
shown in the Natural Healing Table:

Natural Healing Table
Resilience Value
01–10
11–30
31–50
51–70
71–90
91+

Healing Rate
1 Hit Point per 72 hours
1 Hit Point per 48 hours
1 Hit Point per 36 hours
1 Hit Point per 24 hours
1 Hit Point per 18 hours
1 Hit Point per 12 hours

86
186.204.39.123

There are certain restrictions on natural healing, as follows:
•	 An  Adventurer  cannot  engage  in  anything  other  than  light  activity:  if  the  Adventurer 
undertakes anything strenuous then the rate of healing is treated as one stage lower on the 
Natural Healing Table thus, an injured Adventurer with Resilience 44% heals at a rate of 1 
Hit Point every 36 hours. If he decided to assist his colleagues in defending the village from 
attack, his Healing Rate would drop to 1 Hit Point every 48 hours, for the duration of the 
time he engages in work related to the village’s defence.

•	 Natural healing will not heal a Major Wound until that location has either been treated 
with a successful Healing test (see page 60) or significant magical healing has been applied.

Magical Healing
However  magical  healing  is  achieved,  whether  from  a  spell,  prayer  or  potion,  it  has  an 
instantaneous effect.

In  addition  to  the  restoration  of  Hit  Points,  any  location  suffering  a  Major  Wound  that 
receives even a single Hit Point’s restorations through magical healing of commensurate power 
immediately stops bleeding and can benefit from natural healing.

If an Adventurer has been knocked unconscious due to a Serious or Major Wound, the restoration 
of a single Hit Point to the wounded location that caused the unconsciousness will revive them.

Unless  specifically  stated  in  the  magic’s  description,  magical  healing  cannot  re-attach  severed 
limbs or revive the dead.

Hero Points

Hero Points are part of the currency of Legend. Hero Points allow Adventurers to differentiate 
themselves from the rank and file, using Hero Points earned to gain an advantage over opponents, 
find a way through tricky situations, or mitigate that killing blow that gets through even the best 
Adventurer’s defence. 

Every  Adventurer  starts  with  a  fixed  number  of  Hero  Points  that  are  used  throughout  his 
adventures and Quests. New Adventurers start the game with two Hero Points and more can be 
earned as the game progresses.

At  the  conclusion  of  a  story,  each  Adventurer  should  receive  two  Hero  Points. This  can  be 
modified if the Adventurer performed particularly poorly or heroically, giving a range of between 
zero and four Hero Points awarded. However Hero Points need not be reserved for the end of 
a story: if an Adventurer performs some action or deed that the Games Master deems especially 
heroic, or which significantly adds to the atmosphere or progression of the story, then he can 
make  an  immediate  award,  at  his  discretion.  Such  awards  are  never  a  right  and  cannot  be 
demanded  by  players  for  their  Adventurers;  they  are  always  the  Games  Master’s  decision.  In 
these cases ad-hoc awards should be of a single Hero Point and no Adventurer should benefit 
from more than one such award per story.

186.204.39.123

87

Alaric’s Tale
In a battle with a group of trolls, Thrace saves the day through a mixture of quick thinking, deft tactics 
and mighty thrusts with his long spear. As his initiative saves the lives of Alaric and Lilina, the Games 
Master makes him an immediate award of one Hero Point at the end of the combat. At the end of the 
story’s session and following more heroics from all three Adventurers, the Games Master awards each 
of them two Hero Points.

Using Hero Points
Hero Points can be used in a variety of ways. Each of the following options costs a single Hero 
Point. Once spent, a Hero Point is gone forever.

Last Chance Combat Action: If an Adventurer has exhausted his Combat Actions during a fight 
and needs to find that last burst of desperate energy to perhaps avoid a messy end, he may spend 
a Hero Point to gain a Combat Action.

Second Chance: A player can re-roll any Skill Test that affects his Adventurer. This can be a Skill 
Test, damage roll or anything else that has some effect on him. He can even force an opponent 
to re-roll an attack or damage roll made against him.

For example Alaric is engaged in an opposed Skill Test with his great rival, Owain. Both are attempting 
to impress the fair Selena with their storytelling skills (using Influence). Owain has rolled a critical 
success, beating Alaric’s normal success. Alaric thus spends a Hero Point forcing Owain to re-roll his 
Influence skill: the re-roll results in a failure for Owain and so Alaric wins the contest and impresses 
the giggling Selena through a last minute recollection of the heroic fight against the trolls…

Glancing  Blow:  An  Adventurer  who  suffers  a  Major  Injury  may  spend  a  Hero  Point  to 
downgrade the wound to a Serious Injury. This reduces the damage taken to one Hit Point less 
than what would be required to inflict a Major Wound.

Heroic Insight: A Hero Point may be spent to gain a hint or clue from the Games Master that 
helps the Adventurer resolve a situation that has him at an impasse. 

For example, Alaric is trapped within the troll’s lair and can hear troll guards bearing down on him. 
Panicked by the situation, he is truly stuck for what to do next. Alaric spends a Hero Point for a Heroic 
Insight: the Games Master smiles and informs Alaric’s player that, suddenly, he feels a vague draft of 
air against his cheek that could only have come from the crack of a concealed doorway. This prompts 
Alaric to search and he finds the exit just in time. The Heroic Insight has saved his life.

Heroic abilities: The Adventurer may spend Hero Points to acquire a Heroic Ability he has 
qualified for. For more details see the Heroic abilities section on page 218.

Fatigue

Adventurers  are  usually  hardy  individuals  but  even  the  best  of  them  are  still  just  people, 
with  limits  to  what  they  can  physically  achieve. The  greatest  warrior  in  the  world  may  have 

88
186.204.39.123

phenomenal endurance but even he will not be able to run 10 miles to a besieged village and 
then fight for three hours non-stop. As Adventurers engage in strenuous physical activity, they 
risk becoming Fatigued. 

Physical activity is divided into three categories; light, medium and heavy. The length of time 
an Adventurer can engage in physical activity without running the risk of becoming Exhausted 
is  determined  by  his  CON,  as  detailed  under  each  category  of  physical  activity.  Once  this 
time has elapsed, an Adventurer must begin to make Skill Tests in order to resist the effects 
of exhaustion.

•	

Light Activity: Includes travelling at a reasonable pace, casting spells or carrying light loads. 
Adventurers never risk Fatigue while engaging in light activity.

•	 Medium Activity: Includes back-breaking manual labour, running, climbing or swimming. 
An Adventurer can engage in medium activity for a number of minutes equal to his CON 
before risking Fatigue. Once this time has elapsed, the Adventurer must immediately make 
a  Simple  (+20%)  Athletics  test  or  begin  suffering  the  effects  of  Fatigue.  So  long  as  the 
activity continues, he must make another Simple (+20%) Athletics test every time a number 
of minutes equal to the Adventurer’s CON elapse.

•	 Heavy  Activity:  Includes  fighting  in  combat,  sprinting,  swimming  and  climbing 
at  top  speed.  An  Adventurer  can  engage  in  heavy  activity  for  a  number  of  Combat 
Actions equal to his CON score before risking Fatigue. Once this time has elapsed, the 
Adventurer must immediately make a Normal (+0%) Athletics test or begin suffering 
the effects of Fatigue. So long as the activity continues, he must make another Normal 
(+0%) Athletics test every time a number of Combat Actions equal to the Adventurer’s 
CON elapse.

Note that some versions of medium or heavy activity may not require Athletics tests. The Games 
Master may decide that, in order for an Adventurer to escape Fatigue after a long night in the 
Great Library searching for clues, a Persistence test is required instead, as the mental exertion 
counts as medium activity.

Effects of Fatigue
If an Adventurer fails a test whilst engaged in medium or heavy activity, he will begin to show 
Fatigue. Every time a Fatigue test is failed, the Adventurer will drop down one level of Fatigue, 
as shown on the Fatigue Levels table.

Time and Fatigue
Adventurers, regardless of activity, will naturally tire. Once an Adventurer has been awake for 
10+CON hours, they must make a Persistence test or drop one Fatigue level. This test must be 
repeated for every hour the Adventurer remains awake.

Recovering from Fatigue
An Adventurer will move up one level of Fatigue for every two hours of complete rest or four 
hours of light activity. A successful First Aid or Healing test can raise an Adventurer by one level 
of Fatigue once per day but cannot raise an Adventurer above Winded.

Adventurer must make a Difficult Persistence test every Combat Round or 
fall unconscious for 1D6x2 hours.

Exposure, Starvation and Thirst
Freezing cold wastes or crippling hot deserts can take a terrible toll on Adventurers, as can hunger 
and thirst.

Exposure occurs when an Adventurer is insufficiently prepared against a hostile environment, 
normally because of a failed Survival test. An Adventurer can normally survive for a number of 
hours equal to his CON before suffering from exposure, although this can change according to 
weather conditions.

An Adventurer can survive for a number of days equal to his CON before becoming incapacitated 
from starvation, though after three days they will begin to suffer a –10% penalty to Fatigue tests.

An Adventurer can survive for a number of hours equal to his CON x4 before becoming chronically 
thirsty, though particularly arid environments may reduce this to CON x3 or even CON x2.

Whenever an Adventurer is suffering from exposure, starvation or thirst, the Fatigue test penalty 
immediately doubles to –20%. In addition, the Adventurer will automatically suffer one point 
of damage to all locations every day, for every condition he is experiencing. Natural or magical 
healing will not heal this damage – only sufficient shelter, food or water can remedy the problem 
and allow natural or magical healing to take place.

Abstract Fatigue
The standard Fatigue rules aim for a balance between realism and ease of play. However, at the 
Games Master’s discretion, they can be still further simplified for players who find keeping track 
of elapsed rounds almost as tiresome as armed combat.

90
186.204.39.123

The Games Master can simply call for a Simple (+20%) Athletics test after each major exertion 
by an Adventurer or antagonist. A major exertion might be: killing a foe, emptying a treasure 
chamber, fleeing a foe, withstanding a cavalry charge, mounting an infantry charge, swimming 
a rapid river, climbing a castle wall and so on. He should feel free to adjust the rhythm until he 
and the players are comfortable – some groups may agree that it takes three kills (or major duels) 
to induce a Fatigue test. Other groups may decide that the first kill merits a Simple (+20%) 
Athletics test, the second and third a Normal (+0%) Athletics test, the fourth and fifth a Difficult 
(–20%) Athletics test and so forth. A rest between combats might ‘reset’ this clock.

The effects of abstract Fatigue are the same as those given in the regular rules.

Inanimate Objects

Like Adventurers, inanimate objects – such as doors, walls, statues and so forth – can also sustain damage.

All  inanimate  objects  have  Armour  Points  and  Hit  Points.  Except  for  the  most  unusual  of 
circumstances, attacks on inanimate objects will automatically hit – Adventurers simply need to 
work out how much damage they deal.

The  object’s  Armour  Points  will  be  deducted  from  any  damage  dealt  as  normal,  with  the 
remainder being applied to its Hit Points. Once an object’s Hit Points have been reduced to 
zero, it is smashed and useless.

Inanimate objects likely to block or restrain Adventurers, such as doors or ropes, have Armour 
and Hit Point scores. To break down a door, or burst one’s bonds, an Adventurer must succeed 
with  either  a  Brawn,  Unarmed  or  weapon  attack  roll,  as  appropriate.  A  successful  roll  deals 
damage to the item as per the weapon type; a failed roll has simply failed to apply enough force 
or damage to the item to deteriorate its condition. Once the object’s Hit Points reach zero, the 
item is broken or sundered. In the cases where Brawn is used (to break a rope, for example), a 
successful roll inflicts the same damage as an Unarmed attack.

The Inanimate Objects table gives a range of examples of inanimate objects, along with their 
Armour Points and Hit Points.

Inanimate Objects and Weapons
A weapon is designed to cleave flesh, not stone. Using a weapon on an inanimate object with 
Armour Points equal to or greater than that of the weapon, deals damage to both the object and 
the weapon. For instance, using a war sword on a boulder will certainly damage the boulder but 
the war sword itself will be destroyed long before the boulder is. Certain tools and weapons, such 
as the mining pick (see page 115), are designed for use on rock and would not be destroyed if 
used on a boulder.

The  Games  Master  should  exercise  judgement  on  which  weapons  or  tools  can  affect  which 
objects. For example, a warrior with a sword can easily slash through a rope but one armed only 
with a maul is likely to have a much harder time.

Movement

Standard human base Movement is eight metres per Combat Round at walking pace. If sprinting, 
the Movement rate is multiplied by five; however, an Adventurer can only maintain a sprint for 
a number of Combat Rounds equal to his CON before he must test for Fatigue.

The Comparative Movement table summarises typical distances covered, by creatures of differing 
base Movement rates, for a variety of time periods.

Movement in Armour
The armour an Adventurer wears acts against the Movement rate and certain kinds of actions 
such as swimming or climbing.

Armour Penalty = Total Locations Armoured, divided by five and rounded up. Thus, a full suit of 
plate armour (6 AP on seven locations gives an Armour Penalty of 42/5 = –9)

The effects of Armour Penalty on an Adventurer’s Movement are as follows:

•	 Walking or gentle jogging: Armour does not interfere with such movement, although it 

can increase the Fatigue level (see page 90).

92
186.204.39.123

•	

•	

•	

Sprinting: Multiply the base Movement by five and subtract the Armour Penalty. The result is how 
fast the Adventurer can move during short chases, or when charging. For example, an Adventurer 
wearing full plate armour can sprint or charge at 31 metres per Combat Round.
Swimming: Divide the base Movement by two and subtract the Armour Penalty. If the 
result is zero, the Adventurer cannot move and barely keeps himself afloat. If the Movement 
is negative, then the Adventurer sinks. For example, the Adventurer wearing full plate armour, 
with a –9 penalty, has a Swimming Movement of 4–9 = –5: the Adventurer will sink if he 
attempts to swim in his armour.

•	 Climbing  a  rough  surface  (trees,  steep  hills  and  so  on):  The  Armour  Penalty  is 
subtracted from three quarters of the base Movement (six metres per Combat Action 
for  human  Adventurers).  If  the  result  is  zero  or  less,  they  are  too  burdened  by  their 
armour  to  climb.  Thus,  our  hero  in  his  plate  armour  cannot  climb  as  his  Climbing 
movement is 6–9 = –3.

•	 Climbing a sheer surface (walls, cliff faces and so on): The Armour Penalty is subtracted 
from the base Movement divided by two. As with climbing a rough surface, if the result is 
zero or less, the Adventurer cannot climb.
Jumping: Reduce the distance in metres the Adventurer can jump (see the Athletics skill, 
page 46) by the Armour Penalty divided by two. For standing jumps this impairment is 
halved.

Adventuring  is  a  profession  like  any  other  and  this  means  that  success  often  relies  on  good 
equipment – not just on what the Adventurer knows or has experienced. This chapter covers 
a comprehensive array of different equipment for Adventurers, including weapons and armour 
and also items which might, at first glance, offer little practical value but, in the right place and 
at the right time, prove to be life-savers.

Games Masters should read through this chapter and decide which items are going to be available 
to the Adventurers based on their Cultural Background. The tables listing prices and so forth 
offer guidance on availability but it is perfectly possible that a barbarian village has traded with 
civilised merchants and therefore come into possession of goods one would not ordinarily find 
in a barbarian community. Similarly cultural taboos might forbid or restrict the sale of certain 
goods, or shortages in one commodity or another might mean availability is very limited. 

Essentially Games Masters are the final arbiter on what equipment Adventurers can buy once 
their Adventurers have been created and all that silver is burning a hole in their purses. Just 
because this chapter lists something it does not mean that it is available.

Currency

As its default currency, Legend uses coins minted in lead, copper, silver and gold. The standard, 
everyday coins are copper and silver, with gold being the preserve of the very wealthy. The names 
for coins vary from place-to-place but for ease of economy, coins maintain a similar value and 
standard, as follows:

5 Lead Bits (LB) = 1 Copper Penny (CP)
10 Copper Pennies = 1 Silver Piece (SP)
20 Silver Pieces = 1 Gold Crown (GC)

Armour

Armour  absorbs  weapon  damage.  Any  successful  attack  must  first  penetrate  an  Adventurer’s 
armour before it starts reducing Hit Points. This simple fact alone makes armour an essential 
for any Adventurer intending to face great peril or deliberately seek out dangerous challenges. 
However, armour is not infallible: every piece of armour has certain limitations and weak-spots 
and a well-aimed or well-timed blow can bypass armour completely. So a total reliance on armour 
– even good metal armour – is perhaps misplaced. For comfort, and as part of its protection, all 
armour is considered lined or padded.

94
186.204.39.123

Each piece of armour is characterised by the following qualities:

AP: How many Armour Points are given to each location covered by this type of armour. If an 
Adventurer is wearing multiple pieces of armour on a location, only the highest Armour Point 
score is used.

ENC: The weight and bulk of the armour. See page 86 for more details on Encumbrance and 
its effects on Adventurers.

Locations: Which Hit Locations this type of armour protects.

Cost: The average cost in Silver Pieces to purchase this armour.

Armour Effects on Strike Rank and Movement
The more and/or heavier, the armour worn, the more restricted and slower an Adventurer is 
likely to be in combat. Total the APs for each armoured location and divide the result by five, 
rounding up. The result is the Armour Penalty applied to the Adventurer’s Strike Rank.

For example a chainmail shirt covers three locations for 5 AP per location. This gives a total of 15 
AP which, divided by five, gives an Armour Penalty of –3. A full suit of plate mail, covering seven 
locations at 6 AP has a total of 42 AP which, divided by 5 and rounded up, gives an Armour Penalty 
of –9. In combat these penalties would reduce the Strike Rank of the wearers.

The  same  Armour  Penalty  is  applied  to  various  types  of  Movement,  such  as  swimming  or 
climbing. If these penalties are too great, then the Adventurer may find themselves unable to 
perform such actions (see page 92).

Effects of SIZ on Armour
Armour made for an Adventurer of SIZ 1 to 5 will have its cost and ENC halved from that 
shown on the Armour table. Adventurers of SIZ 21 or higher will double the cost and ENC for 
armour made for them.

Armour Types
Soft  Leather:  Armour  made  from  cured  hides  –  the  simplest  form  of  armour  usually  found 
amongst primitive cultures but also worn in more cultivated styles where protection is important 
but not necessarily an essential.

Hard Leather: Strengthened hides and cured leather used for shields and body armour. Hard 
leather is the consistency of shoe leather: hard wearing yet flexible.

Linen Cuirass: Similar to a heavy leather cuirass but the armour is crafted from multiple layers 
of quilted linen. The thick, stiff fabric provides decent protection at a fraction of the weight of 
other materials

Ringmail: Bronze or iron rings sewn onto a leather backing. Heavier than leather but affords 
much better protection.

186.204.39.123

95

Scalemail: Similar to Ringmail but the rings are replaced with scales of metal that overlap, like 
the scales of a fish or serpent.

Chainmail: Woven metal links which, whilst heavy, are flexible and more durable than armour 
relying on a leather base.

Plate: Made of moulded individual metal plates, this armour provides excellent protection but 
is encumbering and comes with a heavy price tag.

Thus, a full suit of plate, covering all seven Hit Locations, would cost 8,400 SP. A full suit of 
Hard Leather costs 700.

However armour does not need to be bought as a full suit: different pieces can be mixed and 
matched,  although  nobles,  especially,  delight  in  wearing  crafted  armour  of  one  type.  The

Clothing

This section is a collection of outfits and special items of clothing that are available from place-to-
place. Unlike common goods, many of these items are very self-explanatory. The way someone is 
dressed can modify Influence rolls in certain situations. Being well dressed may offer a bonus when 
trying to convince poorer folk, or may bring a penalty when negotiating your way past bandits.

Weaponry

It would be unthinkable for an Adventurer to set out into danger without the means to protect 
himself. For many Adventurers a sword or dagger suffices but many soldiers, skilled in a variety 
of weapons, know that different weapons have different applications and that a sword, whilst 
good against one type of foe, is completely useless against another.

The assortment of weapons – Close and Ranged Combat – is extensive. Each weapon is described 
and the description provides any additional effects a weapon might have in a particular situation.

Close Combat Weapons
Each Close Combat weapon is characterised by the following qualities:

Category: The type of weapon this is.

Damage Dice: The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack.

STR/DEX: The minimum STR and DEX scores needed to easily wield this weapon. For every 
point a Characteristic is below these minimums, a –5% penalty is applied to a Adventurer’s skill 
when attacking and parrying with this weapon.

Size:  Each  weapon  possesses  a  size  rating. This  is  related  to  its  mass,  leverage  and  stability. 
The value is used to determine both the weapon’s ability to inflict and parry damage. The size 
categories are Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Huge (H) and Enormous (E). 

Reach: The weapon’s length, how far it can reach in combat (see page 139). The size categories 
are Touch (T), Short (S), Medium (M), Long (L) and Very Long (VL).

Combat Manoeuvres: The Combat Manoeuvres (see the Combat chapter) a weapon can inflict 
– such as Bashing, Impale and so forth.

ENC: The weight and bulk of the weapon. See page 86 for more details on Encumbrance and 
its effects on Adventurers.

AP/HP: The Armour Points and Hit Points possessed by the weapon. When Hit Points reach 0, 
the weapon is broken and useless.

Cost: The average cost in silver pieces to purchase this weapon.

Close Combat Weapon Descriptions
Ball and Chain: This heavy metal ball attached to a short length of chain is notoriously difficult 
to parry. An opponent attempting to parry this weapon treats his parrying weapon or shield as 
one step smaller for the purposes of blocking damage. However, the wielder also suffers the same 
penalty when trying to Parry with the ball and chain.

Battleaxe: A single-bladed weapon with a sturdy haft, the battleaxe may be used with one or two 
hands, depending on the wielder’s preference. A battleaxe can be used to bash through doors and 
obstacles rather quickly. It suffers no damage when attacking inanimate wooden objects.

186.204.39.123

101

Buckler: This small, round shield is held in the hand and used to ‘punch block’ incoming blows. 
Bucklers are often used to attack with the off-hand, when the main weapon is tied up. Its small 
size however, provides little protection against larger weapons or missile fire.

Chain: This two metre length of chain is one step above using an improvised weapon. It is very 
difficult to parry, any weapon interposed against a chain is treated as one step smaller for the 
purpose of blocking damage. However, the wielder also suffers the same penalty when parrying 
with this weapon. If an opponent is caught by surprise, it can also be used as a garrotte.

Club: Perhaps the simplest of all weapons and almost certainly the oldest, the club is simply a 
long, stout piece of wood used to bludgeon others. However, there are several cultures that have 
carved clubs made of stone, or bone – all of which can be sculpted or decorated according to the 
wielder’s preference.

Dagger: Essentially a large knife attached to a short handle, the dagger is often carried as a backup 
or parrying weapon. Thieves, assassins and bandits often enjoy the use of daggers because they can 
be hidden and drawn with ease. Daggers are usually well-balanced enough to throw effectively.

Dirk: This is a short-handled, wide-bladed weapon about half-again the size of a dagger. It is 
commonly used as a secondary weapon, even though it promises sufficient damage any time its 
blade bites flesh. Parrying with a dirk increases the damage blocked by one step (i.e. it is treated 
as a Medium weapon when parrying).

Falchion: A single edged, cleaver-like sword that delivers heavy, chopping blows.

Garrotte: An assassin’s weapon, the garrotte is a cord, chain or thin braided metal wire used to 
loop around a target’s neck and strangle him. Only usable during a grapple or from behind on an 
unsuspecting victim, the garrotte inflicts its damage each and every Combat Action the wielder 
continues to actively crush his victim’s throat. Whilst being strangled, the victim can attempt to 
wrestle free, or damage his opponent so badly they are forced to let go – but acts at a penalty due 
to the strangler being directly behind him.

Great Axe: Up to two metres in length, dwarfing the battleaxe in size, the great axe may be either 
single or double-bladed and must be used with both hands. It also suffers no damage when used 
to break inanimate wooden objects.

Great Club: Little more than a massive branch of wood banded in metal, a great club is much 
less a designed weapon and more a makeshift one. Some cultures might create their own varieties 
of other materials but overall the great club is the weapon of choice for low-intelligence, low-
resource beings of massive strength and size.

Great  Hammer:  The  great  hammer,  or  maul,  is  an  enormous  weapon  that  deals  impressive 
bludgeoning damage. It is a tool as well as a weapon and can sometimes be found with a pick-
like spike on the back portion of its head. Great hammers may be used on inanimate objects 
without being destroyed.

Great  Sword:  This  group  nomenclature  pertains  to  a  number  of  massive  blades  that  can  be 
found as much as two metres in length. They are used by those warriors who want the enemy 
at more than arm’s length, or cleaved beneath the sheering power of the weapon’s strike. Part of 
the blade is unsharpened and leather-bound on many great swords, allowing the wielder to grip 
them for more effective parries.

102
186.204.39.123

Halberd: An axe head combined with a thrusting tip and a hook, mounted on a spear shaft, 
the halberd is a multi-purpose weapon. Halberdiers are versatile opponents that can bring any 
version of the weapon’s attack to bear in an instant. 

Hatchet:  A  simple  and  cheap  one-handed  cleaving  tool,  the  hatchet  is  essentially  a  smaller 
version of an axe. It can be used to cut through wooden inanimate objects with no risk to its 
edge. A hatchet is usually well-balanced enough to throw effectively and many users prefer to 
call these items ‘throwing axes’.

Heater  Shield:  A  medium  sized  shield  designed  for  both  mounted  and  foot  use.  Most  are 
reinforced with metal edging and commonly have some form of symbol or insignia painted on 
the outside face. Heater shields can parry ranged weapons.

Hoplite Shield: Large circular shields designed for foot combat, which are edged and sometimes 
faced  with  metal. This  shield  is  an  excellent  defence  against  even  two  handed  weapons  and 
provides decent cover against missile attacks.

Kite Shield: Kite shields are large shields with an inverted teardrop shape. This shield can switch 
between both infantry and mounted use and is extremely popular for those who spend time in 
both types of combats. Kite shields are also effective against ranged weapons.

Knife: Knives can be made from a sharp piece of metal, stone, bone or even glass. They almost 
always have a short hilt carved from wood. More commonly a tool than a weapon, the knife is a 
multi-purpose item that should be found in every Adventurer’s backpack.

Lance:  An  oversized  spear  designed  to  be  used  from  the  back  of  a  mount,  a  lance  can  be  a 
devastating weapon when charging. A mounted character who uses a lance during a charge may 
add his mount’s Damage Modifier instead of his own to the damage.

Long Spear: The long spear is a lengthy piercing weapon with a wide bladed head, often used in 
ranked units to defeat charging cavalry. 

Longsword: The longsword is a versatile sword with an elongated grip, which allows it to be 
wielded with either one hand or two. Its extra length adds to its reach and used two handed, it 
inflicts greater damage.

Mace: The mace is comprised of a large flanged or knobbed weight mounted on one end of 
a haft, which is often reinforced with metal. Its ability to incapacitate, even heavily armoured 
opponents, makes this a popular weapon in civilised cultures.

Main Gauche: Also called a ‘parrying dagger’, the main gauche is a long-bladed dagger with two 
extremely long and strong quillions. It is normally used in the off-hand in conjunction with a 
longsword, rapier or sabre. Parrying with a main gauche increases the damage blocked by one 
step (i.e. it is treated as a Medium weapon when parrying).

Military Flail: This is a heavy metal ball or rod, usually bristling with spikes or edged flanges, 
attached  to  a  wooden  haft  by  a  short  length  of  chain.  Due  to  its  flexible  construction,  an 
opponent defending against this weapon treats his parrying weapon or shield as one step smaller 
for the purposes of blocking damage. However, the wielder also suffers the same penalty when 
trying to Parry with the flail.

186.204.39.123

103

Military Pick: Also known as a war hammer, a military pick is a short shafted weapon that has 
a metal head with a hammer face on one side and a curved pick on the other. The military pick 
is designed to pierce heavy armour but can also be used on inanimate objects without being 
destroyed.

Morningstar: Carved from a length of wood nearly a metre long, the morningstar is a bladed 
or spiked cudgel.

Net: Used by gladiators, huntsmen and watchmen, the net is more than a mere fishing net to be 
tossed at a target. A fighter’s net is made of thick cord and leather, tipped with numerous hooks 
and heavy weights. It can be swung like a flail, the weights lashing out to batter an opponent, 
inflicting the damage listed. 

Poleaxe: A polearm about the height of a man, it is has a hammer head backed with a metal 
spike and a spear tip for thrusting. This style of two handed war hammer, is very popular against 
heavy armour types.

Poniard: This duellist’s weapon is a long dagger, designed to be thrust into a target. 

Quarterstaff:  A  simple  staff,  sometimes  banded  with  metal  at  either  end.  In  the  hands  of  a 
skilled user, it is a fast and effective weapon for both offence and defence and can be hidden in 
plain sight as a shepherd’s hook or simple traveller’s walking staff. 

Rapier: Fast and light, the rapier relies more on the thrust than the slash. It is a particularly 
effective weapon, especially considering its reach.

Sabre: The sabre is a slightly curved sword, designed to be used for slashing or thrusting when 
mounted. It has a basket hilt which adds one Armour Point to the limb being used to wield it.

Scimitar: A broad-bladed sword, the scimitar has a dramatically curved edge designed for cutting 
and slashing. It is sometimes wider than a normal sheath can hold and is more often hung from 
straps or some form of netting.

Shortspear: Heftier than a javelin and fitted with a broader head made for stabbing; a short spear 
is commonly used in conjunction with a shield. The short spear is a popular and ubiquitous 
weapon,  being  cheap  to  manufacture  and  having  a  reach  advantage  over  most  other  single 
handed weapons.

Shortsword: The shortsword is a straight, broad-bladed sword designed for thrusting. It does 
carry an edge along its sides but use of the edge is always secondary to the thrusting point. 

Target: A medium sized, round shield made of wood and covered with hide. A target mounts 
a long spike on its central boss, making the shield a dangerous weapon, as well as being able to 
parry ranged weapons.

Trident: Another tool turned weapon, a trident is a three-pronged or bladed spear that once was 
used to catch fish in the same way as a harpoon. If a trident impales, its barbed prongs do an extra 
point of damage when being ripped free. 

War Sword: The most common sword type available, the war sword is generally slightly less than 
a metre in length and possesses a sharpened tip to thrust with. It is the ubiquitous weapon of 
choice amongst many Adventurers. 

104
186.204.39.123

Ranged Combat Weapons
Just as Close Combat weapons are defined by certain qualities, so are Ranged weapons.

Category: The type of weapon this is. This is used as a basis for Combat Styles.

Damage Dice: The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack.

Range: This is the effective range of the weapon. The maximum range a weapon can be fired or 
thrown is twice this score.

Load: This shows how many Combat Actions are required to load or reload the weapon.

STR/DEX: The minimum STR and DEX scores needed to easily wield this weapon. For every 
point a Characteristic is below these minimums, a –5% penalty is applied to an Adventurer’s skill 
when attacking with this weapon.

Size: Each ranged weapon possesses a size rating. In the case of projectile weapons, this does 
not relate to the firing weapon itself but rather to how ‘forceful’ its ammunition is. The value is 
used to determine whether the weapon can overcome any shield which may parry it. The size 
categories are Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Huge (H) and Enormous (E). 

Combat  Manoeuvres:  Any  specific  Combat  Manoeuvres  applicable  to  the  weapon  or  its 
ammunition.

ENC: The weight and bulk of the weapon. See page 86 for more details on Encumbrance and 
its effects on Adventurers.

AP/HP: The Armour Points and Hit Points possessed by the weapon. When Hit Points reach 
zero, the weapon is broken and useless.

Cost: The average cost in Silver Pieces to purchase this weapon.

Ranged Combat Weapon Descriptions
Arbalest: This is a metal-armed crossbow that when stood on its end is as tall as a man. It fires 
specially crafted arbalest bolts that have been reinforced in order to withstand the sheer force 
that its braided cord propels them at. Able to drive a finger-thick bolt a full hand’s depth into an 
oak tree, the arbalest hits with force enough to punch through armour as if it were thin cloth but 
requires the use of a windlass to re-cock it. An Adventurer’s Damage Modifier is never applied 
when he is using an arbalest.

Blowgun: This is a hollow tube or pipe, usually made of wood or bone, which expels a tiny dart 
when its user blows on one end. As the dart itself is capable of negligible damage, blowguns are 
seldom used without some kind of poison. An Adventurer’s Damage Modifier is never applied 
when he is using a blowgun. If fired at someone wearing more protection than normal clothing, 
it requires the Combat Manoeuvre of either Bypass Armour or Choose Location to strike flesh.

Bolas: A thrown weapon comprising of two or more weights tied together with lengths of cord. 
Whirled and released, the bolas works by entangling its target in the cords and inflicts damage 
from the winding weights. Unlike other Ranged weapons, the bolas cannot be parried by shields. 
It may only be evaded.

107

Dart: A dart resembles an arrow with a longer head and shorter shaft (usually slightly less than 
half a metre in length). Darts are rarely a warrior’s weapon and are found in the hands of small 
game huntsmen and roguish Adventurers.

Discus: A discus is a flat disc made of stone or metal. Hurling the discus is an old sport and show 
of physical prowess. However, someone who is good enough with a discus could easily split skin 
and shatter bone with a forceful throw. 

Heavy Crossbow: Similar in concept to the light crossbow, this version is larger and reinforced 
with metal bands to handle the immense pull of the string. Many heavy crossbows come with a 
metal stirrup so the firer can use his foot for leverage, or a crank to pull back the thick string. An 
Adventurer’s Damage Modifier is never applied when he is using a heavy crossbow.

Javelin: The javelin is a spear-like weapon with a narrow, pointed head designed for throwing 
short distances. The thrower of a javelin may use Pin Weapon as a Combat Manoeuvre, against a 
parrying shield. In this circumstance, the pinned shield cannot be used until the javelin has been 
removed (which takes one round).

Light Crossbow: A simple mechanical bow, the light crossbow often sees service in small armies 
that lack training in other types of Ranged weapons. It can be clutched in one hand and reloaded 
with the other, making it a good infantryman’s weapon. An Adventurer’s Damage Modifier is 
never applied when he is using a light crossbow.

Long Bow: A long bow has a shaft as much as two metres in length and is designed to be fired 
on foot. A long bow cannot be used from horseback. 

Net: A net can be hurled at an opponent within five metres. Due to its engulfing size, a thrown 
net may only be evaded, not parried.

Recurve Bow: A recurve, or composite bow is made from a laminated combination of wood, 
sinew, horn and sometimes even bone. When strung the bow’s forward-angled arms give it a 
distinctive shape, allowing it to be as strong as a long bow but without the length. Recurve bows 
are mainly used by mounted archers and nomads, since the reduced size means that it does not 
catch on the mount that it is fired from.

Short  Bow:  Designed  to  be  fired  from  horseback,  the  short  bow  is  equally  useful  as  a  foot 
soldier’s weapon. It is a good hunting tool as well as a weapon of war and when used to hunt deer 
and smaller game animals it can make all the difference.

Sling: A sling is a long strip of cloth or leather used to fling a stone or bullet at a target. It is as 
lethal as a bow, able to injure or kill those wearing heavy armour. Many slings also have a sewn-in 
leather cup or pad in which to hold the projectile while gathering velocity. A sling’s range makes 
it useful against archers.

Staff  Sling:  A simple sling mounted on the end of a wooden haft, the staff sling is used by 
whipping the shaft overhead to cast its load. Although it cannot match the sling for range, it can 
be used to throw heavier stones or burning jars of oil (or other noxious substances) in high arcs 
over walls and fortifications. When not being used as a sling, the leather cup and cord can be 
wound around the haft and lashed down, effectively turning the staff sling into a quarterstaff.

Trident: See entry in Close Combat Weapons.

Ranged Weapon Ammunition
The following table lists specific types of ammunition, how sturdy they might be, whether they 
weigh enough to have an ENC score and their cost. Please note that unless an entry has a (#) 
after its name, the price listed is for a single item.

Arbalest bolts: Made of metal-shod hardwood roughly as thick as a man’s thumb, arbalest bolts 
are tipped with heavy metal heads that resemble a stiletto or dagger. They use small fletching 
from waxy-feathered fowl and are remarkably accurate, if only due to the sheer force with which 
they are fired.

Arrows,  Bodkin:  These  arrows  are  the  most  commonly  used  ammunition  in  Legend. They 
possess narrow spikes for points. While not as simple to make as sling bullets, they are far more 
popular for their multiple utilities. 

186.204.39.123

109

Arrow, Broadhead: While a normal arrow can cause quite a wound, these arrows have broad 
cutting surfaces that inflict greater damage, at the expense of range. Using a broadhead arrow 
reduces  the  distance  it  can  be  fired  by  25%  but  inflicts  an  extra  two  points  of  damage  on 
unarmoured opponents.

Arrow, Fishing: More of a tool than a weapon, the fishing arrow is a thin-headed arrow that has 
a set of three small barbs facing backwards to catch and hold a wriggling fish. It also has almost 
no fletching at all (it interferes with underwater propulsion) but rather a small metal ring onto 
which cord or twine can be tied to retrieve a shot fish. Using fishing arrows to catch fish grants a 
+10% bonus to Survival Skill Tests. 

Arrow, Signal: Not made for combat at all, signal arrows have a hollow head bored out in the same 
fashion as a shrilling whistle. When fired (preferably upward into the air) the arrow corkscrews and 
emits a distinct and piercing wail that can be heard on a clear day for up to five kilometres. If actually 
fired at a target, the arrow has a –20% penalty to hit and will cause half damage if successful. 

Blowgun  Darts:  Blowgun  darts  are  small,  thin  needles  or  stubby  miniature  arrowheads  that 
often have a tuft of down or cotton at the end in order to catch the rush of air in a blowgun. They 
are not designed to do damage but can deliver a single dose of poison to a target quite easily – if 
the firer can manage to bypass his armour, of course.

Crossbow Bolts: Simple and stout, bolts are miniature arrows with smaller fletching designed 
to carry the bolt on existing force rather than keep it aloft. They tend to have thinner, more 
compact  heads  of  metal  on  them  to  drive  deeper  with  the  impact  but  some  have  the  wider 
hunting heads commonly seen on arrows. Bolts tend to be thicker than arrows and are purchased 
to fit a specific type of crossbow – wrist, light, medium or heavy.

Sling Bullets: Stone or lead ovals that can reach surprising speeds and accuracy when hurled by a 
skilled user. Bullets can be retrieved rather easily and most can even be hammered or rolled back 
into a usable shape with little effort (as lead becomes soft when heated slightly).

Using Ranged Weapons in Close Combat
Just as Close Combat weapons are not designed to be thrown, so most Ranged weapons are not 
generally designed to be used in Close Combat. Sometimes, however, Adventurers will be left 
with no option but to club someone with a crossbow butt or stab an enemy with an arrow…

If used in Close Combat, a projectile weapon or its ammunition is usually treated as an improvised 
weapon. Use the most applicable combat skill the Adventurer has but apply a –2 modifier to any 
damage rolled, reflecting the inappropriate use of the weapon.

Food and Lodging

General Items

The  following  items,  whilst  billed  as  general,  cover  a  range  of  specifics  as  well  as  day-to-day 
adventuring needs. Some are more useful than others but resourceful Adventurers will be able to 
find a use for just about any of the items listed in the following General Items table.

Each item has a description noting any specifics or game effects. The Cultures column notes 
which Cultural Backgrounds are most likely to have access to the item – although this is offered 
as a guideline only. If an item has no ENC value, it is light enough to be negligible when carried.

General Items
Item
Animal call/
whistle

Animal 
snare/trap

Backpack

Description
This is a small wooden, bone or even metallic whistle 
or instrument used to make attractive sounds in 
the particular style of animal. Commonly used by 
hunters to attract prey, or by scouts to communicate 
signals to one another in non-verbal ways, animal 
calls are seldom larger than a hand’s span in size. Any 
Adventurer using an animal call to hunt can add 
+10% to his Survival skill for hunting purposes.
Using a coiled spring or a weight and pulley, the 
animal snare/trap is designed to snatch small game 
animals like hares or pheasant with remarkable 
force – possibly killing the animal with the rapidly 
yanking noose. 
This standard piece of adventuring equipment, 
held to the back with two shoulder straps, can 
hold 20 ENC of equipment. There is a more 
expensive version that has a reinforced frame, 
allowing for an additional 5 ENC of equipment 
to be strapped to the sides of the backpack as well, 
costing an additional 2 SP.

Bedroll

Block and 
tackle

Description
This includes a blanket and cushioned pad, 
usually carried tightly rolled and tied with a metre 
of leather cord. 
This is a mechanism of pulleys and counterweights 
useful for constructing traps, hauling up heavy 
items and so forth. It adds a +10% bonus to 
Mechanisms tests to make or disarm large traps 
and is required for some Engineering tests. 

Bottle, glass Capable of holding one litre of liquid. The glass 

can be transparent or opaque at no extra cost.

Candle, 1 
hour

A small, stubby candle that will burn for one 
hour before exhausting its fuel. Originally used 
by miners to mark the passage of time while 
they were underground, many Adventurers have 
adopted them for the same purpose. A candle 
illuminates a one metre radius. Any wind stronger 
than a slight breeze will extinguish a candle.
As for previous but slower burning.

Candle, 2

Chain, 2m Bronze or iron chain in a traditional chain-link. 
It has 8 AP and 8 HP per link, applying a –30% 
penalty to any Brawn roll to use brute force to 
break. If used as a weapon, it inflicts 1D6 damage.

Climbing kit Consisting of a leather harness, several short 

Codex

lengths of rope, pitons and sundry other tools, 
a climbing kit provides a bonus of 20% to any 
Athletics Skill Tests made to climb.
A bound volume of 100 papyrus or parchment 
sheets. The price is for a blank codex; codices 
containing sage lore are considerably pricier.

Craft tools This is a small satchel containing portable tools 
appropriate to a particular craft. These tools are 
the bare minimum required to practise the craft 
without a skill penalty. A set of craft tools is useful 
for only one craft – an Adventurer must buy more 
sets of tools for any additional crafts.
Adds +10% to Brawn rolls to lever open doors, 
casket lids and the like. If used as a weapon, it is 
considered a club (wielded with a –10% penalty).

Description
This wedge of serrated metal is roughly the 
length of a man’s hand, with very rough rasps 
up and down two of its sides. It is used under a 
wooden door to keep it from opening. It takes two 
Combat Actions to place and hammer a doorjamb 
but when it has bitten into the door and gripped 
the floor, it makes the door immobile without 
a Brawn roll pull the door open (with a –20% 
penalty).
Used for temporarily colouring clothing, hair or 
even skin, dye comes in a thick paste that must 
be spooned into a water-vinegar mix to dilute 
properly. Any dyed object will take on the new 
colour but it will eventually fade or wash out after 
1D6 weeks.

Item

First aid kit A first aid kit is made up primarily of bandages, 
tourniquets and herbal compresses. It allows the 
owner to use the First Aid skill without penalty. A 
first aid kit is good for five uses (whether the Skill 
Test succeeds or fails) before it is used up.
A small metal hook used to catch fish. This item 
allows an Adventurer to use his Survival skill to 
catch a fish without suffering a penalty on the test.
Fishing kit Consisting of several hooks, thin but strong line, 
a segmented rod and corks, the fishing kit grants 
an Adventurer a +20% bonus to his Survival test 
to catch fish.
The fastest and easiest way to start a fire, an 
Adventurer with flint and tinder can build a fire 
in one minute under normal conditions without 
having to roll his Survival skill. Games Masters 
may wish to impose penalties if the Adventurer is 
attempting to start a fire in a high wind or driving 
rain.
Small sheets of layered fur and silk lashed under 
the user’s existing shoes or boots, footpads reduce 
the noise footfalls make by a remarkable margin. 
Although the items are heavier than they look, 
reducing the wearer’s movement by one metre per 
movement, they are exceptionally quiet and add 
+10% to Stealth for silent movement purposes.

Lantern,

Description
Tied to a rope, it can be lofted up to half the 
thrower’s STR in metres with an Athletics test. It 
will support the weight of 50 ENC or 50 SIZ, or 
any combination thereof.
Useful in a variety of capacities, a hammer is a 
tool no Adventurer should be without. If used 
as a weapon, it is treated as a club (wielded with 
a –10% penalty). Hammers may be used on 
inanimate objects without being destroyed.
Stocked with bandages, mortar and pestle, 
poultices, barber’s tools, basic surgical equipment 
and everything else a healer needs to practise his 
trade on the road, a healer’s kit is necessary for an 
Adventurer to use the Healing skill.
This specially blown tube of curved glass set into 
a wooden or brass frame is filled with fine sand 
that takes exactly an hour’s time to pass through. 
Fragile and easily disturbed, the hourglass is an 
important piece of equipment for alchemists and 
mages, who need to keep track of reaction and 
application times for future notation and possible 
adjustments.
Made of rope with rope or wooden rungs (increase 
ENC to 5 for wooden rungs), a rope ladder 
provides a +20% (+30% for wooden rungs) bonus 
to Athletics rolls when used for climbing.
Most lanterns are made of brass or bone and 
use a leather or metal flap to shield the oiled or 
waxen mantle inside. A basic lantern provides 
clear illumination for a three metre radius. It 
will burn for two hours on a flask of oil.
A cowled lantern is a smaller lantern that is always 
made from bronze and brass with a stiff leather 
hood that pulls back from its one main opening. 
Inside the cowled lantern is a ring of polished 
mirrors that reflect the light of the burning oil into 
a focused beam that comes out of the opening 
when the hood is pulled back. The beam of light 
from a cowled lantern extends 10 metres but is only 
a metre wide. It will burn for one hour on a flask 
of oil.

Lantern, 
hanging

Description
An extremely delicate and decorative lantern 
made of coloured paper and thin wood, a hanging 
lantern is used to cast a dim but pleasing glow to 
a large area. The coloured light from a hanging 
lantern provides hazy illumination up to a four 
metre radius. It will burn for three hours on a flask 
of oil.

Magnifying 
Lens

Lock picks An item no self-respecting thief would ever be 
without, lock picks allow an Adventurer to use 
his Mechanisms skill to pick a lock. The Games 
Master may assign penalties or bonuses to this test 
based upon the specific circumstances.
Whether mounted on a handle or in a pair of wire 
frames to be worn as spectacles, this specifically 
shaped piece of ground glass is used to magnify 
writing, symbols or other tiny clues. While 
looking through the lens at anything within a 
distance of one metre, the Adventurer gets a +25% 
bonus to Perception. However, he suffers a –15% 
penalty to Perception tests concerning everywhere 
else. Also, a magnifying lens held still and fed 
sufficient light from the sun or other remarkable 
source can create a heat source that will ignite 
flammable objects.
This is a handheld pair of grinding stones that 
can be loaded with spices, grains and minerals to 
be turned to powder. Milling stones are helpful 
for alchemists, healers, shamans and magicians 
to have a source for their various and sundry 
ingredients while on the road. The grinding 
process takes less than a few minutes for most 
substances but could take hours for gemstones or 
other extremely dense materials.

Milling 
Stone

Mining pick A mining pick allows its user to chip his way 

through rock (albeit slowly). If used as a weapon, 
it is considered a club (wielded with a –20% 
penalty). Mining picks may be used on inanimate 
objects without being destroyed.

around 70 SP (for a flute, lute or equivalent, for 
example). Larger and better quality instruments 
cost multiples of 70 SP. For example, a good 
quality lute would costs 140 SP and a reasonable 
quality cello or bass horn would cost the same.

Oar, 
collapsible

Net, fishing This is a two metre by two metre weighted net of 
woven fibres designed to be dropped into standing 
or running water to catch fish, crustaceans and 
the like, for food. It takes 3D10 minutes to use 
the net properly but adds a +25% bonus to the 
Adventurer’s Survival skill for the purposes of 
catching food in this way.
A hinged piece of metal with a wide wooden 
end that snaps open to a half-metre length, the 
collapsible oar gives a +5% to Boating due to its 
lightweight and expertly crafted design. When 
used in combat, the collapsible oar acts as a club 
(with a –10% penalty).
A single flask of oil is enough to fuel a basic 
lantern for two hours, or, if broken on the ground 
and ignited, enough to sustain a small fire for 
one minute. Oil is packaged in small pottery or 
glass bottles but can also occasionally be found 
in waxed leather skins. A skin cannot be ‘broken’ 
as mentioned previously – either on purpose or 
accidentally.

Oil, flask

Oil, Jellied Mixing sawdust, chalk or hoof shavings into 

common lamp oil slowly over a period of time can 
eventually create a combustible jelly that is very 
useful for smearing on torches and other objects 
that are to be set alight at a later time. A single 
spark will light jellied oil on fire and it will then 
burn as if it were a common flask of oil. After it 
has been smeared onto something, jellied oil stays 
combustible for up to a week before it begins to 
lose its potency.

Oil, weapon Used to keep rust and tarnish off the precious 

Description

edges of bladed weapons, weapon oil is extremely 
thin and is made primarily from the rendered 
fat and oils from fish or whales. It is relatively 
odourless and carries with it only a very slight 
yellowish tint. It is only slightly more flammable 
than cooking oils and a single bottle of it can 
upkeep dozens of weapons for weeks at a time. 
Any blade treated with weapon oil after it has been 
used in combat will not suffer from mundane rust 
or tarnish for a week or so.
A papyrus sheet is a sheet of thin, brittle paper 
useful for taking notes, drawing maps or even 
making a rubbing of a raised surface. It is 
painstakingly made from papyrus reeds and 
is considered a luxury item by most common 
people. A sheet of papyrus is square, half a metre 
by half a metre. Once written on, a papyrus sheet 
can be ‘waxed’ to make the ink water resistant 
and smear-proof, though this also makes the sheet 
more flammable should it ever be exposed to an 
open flame.
A long pole serves many useful purposes to an 
Adventurer, from testing the stability of the 
ground ahead of him, to functioning as a crude 
yoke.
Quivers can generally hold up to 30 arrows or 
crossbow bolts.
The mainstay of any barber’s tools, the folding 
razor is the best implement to painstakingly 
remove three day old stubble. Useful for a variety 
of reasons, the razor can also be used to inflict 
rather nasty wounds on bare flesh – inflicting 1D3 
damage upon scoring a hit on an unarmoured Hit 
Location. Armour of any kind stops this damage 
completely and dulls the blade considerably. Apart 
from the damage, a folding razor has the same 
statistics as a dagger.

silken rope is superior to braided hemp in nearly

in 10 metre lengths but can support 60 ENC or 
60 SIZ, or any combination thereof. Silken rope 
requires more knots to make it usable for climbing 
purposes, shortening it by four metres.

This long piece of hammered metal has been 
Saw, hand
sharpened to have a jagged and serrated edge 
perfect for ripping through wood, which is 
attached to a leather-wrapped handle. With 
enough strokes back and forth, the hand saw can 
cut through wood at a rate of 1D4 Hit Points per 
round – ignoring AP from the wooden object. 
If used as a makeshift weapon it can be used as a 
crude short sword (with a –15% penalty) but will 
likely never be usable as a saw again.
Primarily a tool for harvesting grain, a scythe can 
be put to work as a weapon when necessary. If 
used as a weapon, it is considered a bill (wielded 
with a –10% penalty).
Often built into jewellery, such as a ring or 
necklace, seals are carved with an identifying crest 
or mark representing its owner. These are used to 
press wax to close letters, scrolls or other similar 
objects. Recognising a specific family, guild or cult 
seal requires a Lore (Regional) Skill Test (modified 
as the Games Master sees fit).
This is a small shovel, sometimes with a 
detachable wooden handle. It can be used to dig 
large amounts of soil or sand in relatively short 
order but is all but useless on stone or very dense 
earth. If used as a weapon, it is considered a club 
(wielded with a –20% penalty).
This folding animal hide or fabric tent can be set 
up in just a few minutes and will keep up to four

comfortable, which is why so many Adventurers 
invest in good bedrolls and warm clothing for long 
journeys.

properly, up to eight human-sized individuals can 
sleep inside without fear for most normal weather 
conditions. 
A torch has one end wrapped in cloth and dipped 
in pitch or a similar flammable substance. It can 
be lit with flint and tinder in one round and will 
burn for one hour. A torch illuminates a three 
metre radius. If used as a weapon, it is considered 
a club (wielded with a –10% penalty), except that 
it does not inflict normal damage – instead, it 
inflicts 1D4 fire damage and a fumble or critical 
hit will also extinguish the brand.
As for previous but treated with longer-lasting 
materials.
As for previous but the materials are treated with 
inflammable and water dispelling chemicals so 
that, even when wet, the torch still lights. It will 
not burn underwater, however.
A lined bladder or sewn leather pouch designed to 
contain liquids, with a wooden or bone spout at 
one end for pouring. A typical waterskin can hold 
enough water to sustain an Adventurer for two 
days but can also be used to hold wine, poison or 
other liquids equally well.

Wax, block Used for a variety of reasons in several professions, 

beeswax is much like rope in that many 
Adventurers find ways to put it to inventive use. 
Thieves will press keys into it in order to make 
effective forgeries, mages might need it to seal up 
potions or component bottles and so on.

Writing kit The basic writing kit contains several vials of black 

ink, as well as brushes, quills and pens used for 
calligraphy and scribing. The largest part of the

a piece of papyrus. For an additional cost writing 
kits can also contain other coloured inks.

Riding and Animal Supplies
The Riding and Animal Supplies table shows a number of items and supplies that Adventurer 
could find very useful when dealing with animals (like those found in the Beasts and Cohorts 
chapter of this book), how much they weigh in ENC and their general market cost.

Riding and Animal Supplies
Item
Bit and 
Bridle

Description
This is a short piece of leather or metal that is placed in the 
mouth of a mount and attached to a set of leather or chain 
reins to allow the rider or driver to steer the beast. Although 
it does not offer any sort of bonus to Riding or Driving tests, 
not having a bit and bridle on a mount when an Adventurer 
Critically Fumbles one of these tests can be catastrophic (at 
the Games Master’s discretion).
The crop is a piece of wood, bone or metal with a folded 
leather strap at the end. It is used to force a mount to push 
harder. Spurring movement with the stinging and noisy 
‘crack’ of a crop on the hindquarters of a ridden mount can 
sometimes bring higher speeds. In game terms this allows 
a rider to make an additional Riding Skill Test to increase 
speed, though he can only do so three turns in a row before 
the mount becomes numb or angry.
A length of thin and flexible wood tipped with a long, thin 
piece of resin-coated cord or braided leather, a driver’s whip 
is used to sting the flanks of drawing mounts from the 
driver’s bench of a wagon, coach or cart. It is used to bring 
higher speeds out of the entire team. In game terms this 
allows a driver to make an additional Driving Skill Test to 
increase speed but he can only do so a number of turns in a 
row equal to the number of drawing mounts attached to the 
vehicle before the team becomes inured.
This kit includes a thick leather glove or gauntlet with cord 
sewn to it in order to tether a falcon or hunting hawk when 
at rest. It also includes a leather or wooden hood that fits 
over the eyes and ears of the bird in an effort to keep the 
animal calm before releasing it to perform its duties. Anyone 
attempting to perform Craft (Falconry) Skill Tests without a 
full falconer’s kit suffers a –10% penalty to his Skill Test.
Whether it is a supply of corn mash and oats for a stallion, 
sardines for a sea lion or osprey, or chunks of raw horsemeat 
for a griffon, this category covers the road rations needed 
to keep a mount healthy and strong. If they do not pack 
additional feed, Adventurers will need to make additional 
Survival or Tracking rolls every week in order to keep their 
mounts from becoming sickly or unruly.

A thick-hafted piece of ivory, bone or wood tipped with a 
rounded hook and jabbing pinion, a goad is like a riding 
crop for thicker-skinned beasts, such as reptiles, pachyderms,

A specialised saddle designed for beasts with wings like 
griffons and sky bulls, this is a must for aerial cavalry. The 
flight saddle has additional thigh stirrups that keep a rider 
tethered to the animal as it flies. The straps are difficult to 
unlatch when in motion – requiring a Mechanisms roll at 
+10% to do so in combat.

Saddle, pack This is basically a riding saddle with two sets of attached 

Saddle, 
riding

saddlebags and an additional wooden cage for goods where 
a rider would normally sit. The pack saddle can carry an 
impressive 40 ENC of weight but leaves no room for a rider.

This is the most common form of leather saddle and is the 
style that most riders prefer for long trips. Even though it 
does not offer any sort of bonus to Riding Skill Tests, riding 
a horse at anything faster than a brisk walk without one 
imposes a –10% penalty to Riding.

Saddle, war The heaviest of saddles, a war saddle has a raised front horn 
and padded back in order to support an armoured rider and 
several additional buckles to attach to barding. Using a war 
saddle inflicts one level of Fatigue per full eight hours of use 
but it does add +10% to any Riding Skill Tests made during 
combat, or when resisting knockback.

Saddlebag

A pair of canvas, leather or cloth bags designed to be draped 
over the shoulders or flanks of a mount in order for it to 
carry more equipment or goods for the owner. A saddlebag 
can carry 15 ENC worth of weight.

Shoes, horse Common metal shoes nailed to the bottom of hoofed 

animals, ‘horse’ shoes are designed to keep sharp stones and 
gravel from chipping or splitting a hoof. Hoofed mounts 
that do not have shoes will need to be rested more frequently 
in order to remove detritus, imposing a –10% penalty to 
travel times through any type of rocky or stony terrain.

combat

Combat  is  an  inevitable  part  of  Legend.  Violence,  whether  it  is  a  squabble  descending  into 
fisticuffs between childhood rivals, a drunken bar-room brawl, or a duel to the death between 
mortal enemies, is handled using these rules.

Legend combat has certain hallmarks that are worth bearing in mind; these are as follows:

•	 Combat is a deadly business, irrespective of an Adventurer’s level of skill. A well-placed blow 

can take down the hardest or best armoured Adventurer.

•	 Combat is tactical. Good tactical decisions or choices can greatly influence the outcome of 

a battle. The combat rules are designed to support tactical options.

•	 Combat should be fun. Although it deals with violence – and does so seriously – there is little like 

•	

a good, well orchestrated melee to get the pulse racing and the adrenalin flowing. 
Legend combat aims to be cinematic. What is meant here is that melees and ranged combat 
can emulate the feats seen in television and movies – be they dashing, swashbuckling duels; 
gritty,  bloody  one-on-one  combats,  or  large-scale,  epic  stand-offs  between  heroes.  The 
combat rules are designed to handle all such confrontations.

Alaric’s Tale
Alaric, Thrace and Lilina have penetrated the underground layer of the troll Illsa Skessa, the troll 
Alaric believes was responsible for his father’s murder. Creeping through the narrow tunnels of the 
underground complex the three companions emerge into a large cavern which, the frail light of their 
torches shows, is filled with debris, discarded bones from eagerly devoured troll-meals and, over in a 
corner, slowly roasting something they have captured, a group of goblin guards. The goblins look up 
and squint as torch-light falls over them; hands fall to nearby weapons. Alaric, Thrace and Lilina are 
in no mood to run but are eager for a fight.

Combat is about to commence…

Components of Combat

Most  combats  consist  of  very  similar  components  using  very  similar  timeframes.  These 
components are as follows:

Combat Skills and Styles 
Combat skills are purchased as styles. Learning the style ‘Broadsword and Shield’ costs the same 
skill points as learning ‘Greataxe’, thus avoiding the necessity of having to train each weapon 
in a combination separately. Alaric, for example, has the Combat Style ‘Spear and Shield’; this 

186.204.39.123

123

Combat  Style  combines  the  techniques  of  spear  attack  and  shield  defence  but  does  not  cost 
Alaric two separate skills to gain – they are trained together.

There  is  a  myriad  range  of  different  Combat  Styles  and  Adventurers  can  create  their  own 
combinations to mirror personal preferences, cultural fighting styles or professional requirements. 
Some typical examples are:

Sword and Shield (any one-handed sword and any shield type); Mace and Shield; Sword and Dagger 
(any one-handed sword coupled with a dagger which is used for parrying but may also be used for attack); 
Two-Handed Sword (a large sword requiring two hands to stabilise but inflicting greater damage).

In situations where the user of a ‘two weapon’ or a ‘weapon and shield’ Combat Style is unable, 
for whatever reason, to utilise part of the combination, then the wielder’s skill is unchanged but 
he does lose the advantage of having two weapons or the defensive capabilities of his shield.

Adventurers trying to decide what sort of Combat Style to select should consider the following:
 
•	 Two handed weapons normally grant an advantage in both inflicting and parrying damage 

•	

and give the user a greater reach (see Weapon Reach).
Shields  allow  the  user  an  extra  Combat  Action  per  round,  as  well  as  protecting  against 
missile attacks – which most other weapons cannot parry.

•	 Using two weapons simultaneously also permits the wielder an extra Combat Action per 
round and maintains their effectiveness if one weapon is pinned, entangled or dropped. 
Secondary  off  hand  weapons  must  be  one  size  category  smaller  than  the  main  weapon, 
unless both are small.

•	 One handed weapon styles do not give an extra Combat Action, but allows one hand free 

for casting Sorcery spells and touch-range spells.  

•	 Unarmed Combat Styles have few direct benefits save that the user is always able to fight 
and protect themselves when lacking a weapon and can freely combine unarmed attacks 
with any other combat style at no penalty (as long as the opponent is within reach). An 
unarmed attack can be made with any part of the body, except for the torso. Thus limbs, 
wings, tails and even the head can be used.

Missing Weapons: An Adventurer who is missing some of the weapons for his Combat Style 
does not suffer any further penalties. For example, if Alaric is forced to use his Spear and Shield 
Combat Style when he lacks a shield, he loses the protection of the shield and the bonus Combat 
Action from having an off-hand weapon but there is no penalty to his skill.

Substituting Weapons: AnAdventurer can use weapons other than the ones he specialises in but 
at a penalty. Firstly, any weapons used must be of the same type as those he normally uses in his 
Combat Style. For example, an Adventurer can substitute a short sword for a long sword but 
not a mace for a longsword as the mace is used as a bludgeon, not a cutting edge. Secondly, the 
Combat Style skill is penalised as follows:
•	
–10% for using a different weapon.
•	
–10% for each Size category difference between the two weapons.
•	
–10% for each Reach category difference between the two weapons.
•	
–5% for each point of ENC difference between the two weapons.

These penalties cannot take an Adventurer below his base STR+DEX attack skill.

For  example,  if  Alaric  were  forced  to  use  a  Longspear  instead  of  his  preferred  shortspear,  he 
would suffer a penalty as follows:

124
186.204.39.123

–10% for using a different weapon.
–10% for the Size difference (shortspears are Medium, Longspears are Large).
–10% for the Reach difference (Long vs Very Long).

•	
•	
•	
•	 No penalty for ENC, as they both weigh the same.
For a total penalty of –30%.

Combat Rounds
Since fights in Legend often involve a large number of Skill Tests for attacks, parries and such 
like, combat is divided into rounds to ease book keeping. Each round represents a period of 
five seconds during which time Adventurers can perform their full number of Combat Actions.

Each Combat Round begins with the participant (Adventurer, adversary or monster) with the 
highest initiative acting first, spending one of his Combat Actions. This is followed by whoever 
has the next highest initiative and so forth until the participant with the lowest initiative has 
acted.  Then,  if  anyone  still  has  any  Combat  Actions  remaining,  the  cycle  repeats  until  all 
available Combat Actions for all available participants have been spent. At this point the round 
ends. If the participants are prepared to continue fighting, a new round begins; if they withdraw 
from combat or cannot continue to fight, actions revert to Local Time and the combat is over.

Alaric’s Tale
The goblin guards are some metres distant from Alaric, Thrace and Lilana but it is clear that a fight 
is likely. ‘What are you going to do?’ The Games Master asks each player. ‘We ready our weapons and 
prepare to fight,’ Alaric’s player says and the others agree. ‘Okay,’ the Games Master replies and reaches 
for a sheet of paper to start recording initiative, hits, damage and other combat information, ‘we’re 
moving to Combat Rounds; five second bursts measured by Combat Actions. Everybody ready? Good… 
Initiative rolls please…’

Initiative
Who acts first and the order of action is crucial in combat. Initiative is the method of determining 
in which order the participants act. Initiative is measured in Strike Ranks and rolled at the start 
of a fight, remaining in play unless something occurs to force Initiative to be re-rolled. This is 
up to the Games Master to decide but at the very minimum an Initiative roll lasts for an entire 
Combat Round.

Calculating Initiative
To calculate Initiative, each participant rolls 1D10 and adds his Strike Rank. The highest result 
acts first, followed by the next highest and so on. If two participants tie scores, then they act 
simultaneously. If both are attacking simultaneously, a weapon being used to strike cannot also 
be used to parry a simultaneous blow.

Armour Penalty
Strike Rank Penalty = (Totalled Armour Points worn on all locations) divided by five.

As discussed on page 92 Armour has a negative impact on Initiative; the heavier the protection 
worn, the bigger the hindrance to moving and reacting quickly. An Adventurer’s Strike Rank is 
reduced by one fifth of the totalled value of AP worn on all locations (rounded up).

186.204.39.123

125

Alaric’s Tale
The Games Master has called for Initiative. This means Alaric, Thrace and Lilina must roll 1D10, 
add their Strike Rank score and then apply any modifications for armour. Here are the core results of 
the Initiative Rolls:

Alaric rolls 6. Strike Rank of 15 means he has a total Strike Rank of 21. 
Thrace rolls 1. Strike Rank of 12 means he has a total Strike Rank of 13.
Lilana rolls 10. Strike Rank of 14 means she has a total Strike Rank of 24.

The Games Master treats all the goblins as having the same Strike Rank of 12; he rolls 3, so the goblins 
have Strike Rank 15. However, armour needs to be factored into all of this.

Alaric wears soft leather (2 AP) across four Hit Locations for a total of 8 AP. Dividing this by five and 
rounding up gives Alaric a –2 Armour Penalty, so his Strike Rank is reduced to 19.

Thrace wears similar armour to Alaric and so he, too, has a –2 Armour Penalty, bringing his Strike 
Rank down to 11.

Lilana wears her grandmother’s leather breastplate, greaves and vambraces, plus her bronze, plumed 
helmet. Her armour totals 16 AP which, divided by five and rounded up gives a –4 Armour Penalty; 
her Strike Rank is reduced to 20.

The goblins wear a few scraps of armour that create just a –1 Armour Penalty. Their Strike Rank 
becomes 14.

With Strike Ranks calculated and adjusted for armour, the order of combat is thus:

Strike Rank 20 
Strike Rank 19 
Strike Rank 14 
Strike Rank 11 

Lilana
Alaric
Goblins (three of them)
Thrace

Each round of combat proceeds in this order unless something happens that causes Initiative to be 
calculated again.

For example a full suit of chainmail armour with a closed helm (36 points in total) creates a –8 Strike 
Rank penalty.

Movement in Combat 
In a Combat Round, an Adventurer may move up to his standard Movement allowance. This 
movement is divided across all of the Adventurer’s Combat Actions. Each Combat Action may 
include all, some or none of the Adventurer’s remaining Movement in addition to an attack or 
other action. For example, an Adventurer with a Movement of 8m and 3CA could:
1st Combat Action: Move 3m, make an Attack
2nd Combat Action: Move 1m, make an Attack 
3rd Combat Action: Move 4m, make an Attack  or

126
186.204.39.123

1st Combat Action: Move 0m, make an Attack
2nd Combat Action: Move 0m, make an Attack 
3rd Combat Action: Move 8m, make an Attack.

The total amount moved may not exceed the Adventurer’s Movement (except when Sprinting).

Combat Actions
Combat Actions (CA), calculated during Adventurer Creation, are used when attempting any 
kind of activity during a combat; for example, to attack, defend, change engagement distance, 
cast spells and so forth.

When a Combat Action is spent, it is gone; Adventurers therefore need to assess how they use CA 
according to the nature of the opponent and the odds being faced.

How an Adventurer’s Combat Actions are used is completely up to the player, who may be as 
aggressive  or  defensive  as  he  wishes When  combined  with  Initiative,  CA  take  on  a  dynamic 
nature; since how they are used can depend on the order of when one acts in the round.

For example, Alaric is forced into a fight. He has 3 CA and has rolled a better Initiative than his 
opponent. Going first he decides to attack and the foe succeeds in parrying. Both have used one CA 
for that round. Then it is the opponent’s turn and he counter-attacks, forcing Alaric to parry. Now 
both have used two CAs. Since the lowest Initiative has been reached but both combatants still have 
a Combat Action remaining; the GM cycles back to the highest Initiative again – allowing Alaric to 
attack a second time that round. His opponent again parries the blow and the round ends, since both 
foes have no more Combat Actions remaining. Thus going first allowed Alaric to use his CA to attack 
twice and parry once.
 
The following are activities an Adventurer can attempt by spending one Combat Action during 
their turn. Cast Spell, Evade and Parry are special in that they can be used at any time during the 
Combat Round as a reaction to an incoming threat.
 
•	 Attack: The Adventurer can attempt to strike with a hand-to-hand weapon or fire a missile 

at an opponent.

•	 Cast Spell: The Adventurer can attempt to cast a spell.
•	 Change Distance: The Adventurer can attempt to change the range at which he is fighting, 
either  closing  with  his  opponent  or  putting  distance  between  them  (see  Closing  and 
Disengaging on page 139).

•	 Change Stance: The Adventurer can shift from standing to prone or vice versa and anything 

in between.

•	 Delay: The Adventurer may pause to assess the tactical situation. This changes his Strike 
Rank  to  the  number  when  he  finally  does  act.  If  no  action  is  taken  before  Strike  Rank 
reaches zero, then the Combat Action is lost.

•	 Do Nothing: An Adventurer can decide to simply spend his Combat Action doing nothing 

useful.

•	 Evade: Adventurers can attempt to dive or roll clear of missiles or a charging attack. This 
action can also be declared in advance of an anticipated attack (see Parry). The CA available 
on the character’s next Strike Rank following an Evade attempt cannot be used to make an 
Attack. This penalty carries over to a new round if the Adventurer uses his last available CA 
in a round to Evade.

186.204.39.123

127

•	 Mount/Dismount: The Adventurer can mount or dismount a riding beast.
•	 Move: If unengaged, tthe Adventurer may move his full movement rate. 
•	 Outmanoeuvre: The Adventurer can engage multiple opponents in a group Opposed Test 
of Evade skills. Those who fail to beat his roll cannot attack him that Combat Round. See 
the section on Outmanoeuvre on page 137.

•	 Parry: The Adventurer can attempt to deflect an incoming attack. As well as being a reactive 
response, this action can also be declared in advance of an expected attack by adopting a 
defensive stance. However, once committed, the CA cannot be converted back to any other 
type of action and is lost if not used before his next Strike Rank occurs.

•	 Ready Weapon: The Adventurer may draw, sheath or reload a weapon. Dropping a weapon 
costs  no  CA.  However  retrieving a  dropped  weapon within  reach  costs  two  CA: one  to 
retrieve the weapon and a second to return to a readied stance.

Alaric’s Tale
Alaric has three Combat Actions whilst Thrace and Lilina have 2 CA each – as do the three goblins. 
Thus, Alaric has a slight edge over his opponents.

Weapon Size and Reach
Every  weapon  possesses  two  ratings,  Size  and  Reach. These  are  used  to  determine  both  the 
weapon’s ability to parry damage and its reach in combat. The size categories are Small, Medium, 
Large, Huge, and Enormous. Further sizes are beyond the scope of mere mortal encounters. The 
reach categories are Touch, Short, Medium, Long and Very Long.

The Equipment chapter provides more information on sizes, along with the reach categories for 
each weapon in Legend. However, as a simple guide, use the following to calculate which size 
category a weapon belongs to.
 
•	

Small  –  Human  unarmed  combat  and  light  single  handed  weapons  less  than  a  kilo  in 
weight; a dagger, for example.

•	 Medium – Single handed weapons over a kilo in weight; a scimitar, for instance.
•	 Large – Long hafted thrusting weapons such as polearms or spears.
•	 Huge –Two handed slashing, chopping or bashing weapons, like great axes.
•	 Enormous – Weapons used by very large creatures: tree trunks used by giants, for example.

Reach categories use the following guidelines.

Short – Weapons less than half a metre long; such as a short sword.

•	 Touch – Human reach in unarmed combat, knuckledusters and so on.
•	
•	 Medium – Single handed swung weapons longer than half a metre, like a ball and chain.
•	
•	 Very Long – Two handed thrusting weapons, spears or polearms for example.

Long – Single handed thrusting weapons, or two handed swung weapons, e.g. a great sword.

The unarmed attacks of animals and monsters are assigned categories to determine their reach 
and how difficult they are to parry.

Combat Mechanics

Fighting in Legend is a brutal recreation of close combat. Most battles are resolved in a blow by 
blow progression, each attack representing a single swing of a weapon. Even if an Adventurer 
manages to roll a successful strike at an opponent, the foe is allowed their own roll to see if they 
can parry the blow. The same mechanism is used whether the attacks are missile weapons against 
opponents diving for cover, a ferocious wrestling match, or trying to evade a charge of angry 
dinosaurs.

Attacks and Parries
To make either an Attack or Parry both the attacker and the defender must spend a Combat 
Action and roll against their appropriate Combat Style. The attacker’s and defender’s results are 
noted because the difference between them, if a difference in level of success exists, is crucial to 
the outcome of the exchange. 

The intention to parry must be declared before any attack roll is made. However, if the attack 
misses then the parrying participant can opt not to complete the parry, thereby saving his CA 
from being spent. This does mean, though, that he will not gain a defensive Combat Manoeuvre 
(see Combat Manoeuvres, page 134), for the exchange.

Successful Roll
If the attacker succeeds with the attack, he rolls weapon damage and adds his Damage Modifier 
(if any). 

If  the  defender  succeeds  in  his  Skill  Test,  then  he  can  reduce  the  attacker’s  damage,  if  any, 
according to the comparative size of their weapons.

•	
•	
•	

Parrying an attack with a weapon or shield of equal or greater size deflects all damage. 
Parrying with a weapon or shield of one size less only deflects half damage.
Parrying with a weapon or shield two or more sizes less fails to deflect any damage. 

For example, parrying a great axe with a greatsword would block all damage; parrying it with a 
target shield would halve the damage and parrying it with a dagger would stop no damage at all.

If the attacker has missed then obviously no damage will be inflicted. However, the defender 
should still roll to see if his parry succeeds, in case he manages to beat the attacker’s level of 
success – granting them the choice of one or more opportunistic Combat Manoeuvres.

Unsuccessful Roll and Fumbles
If  both  combatants  fail,  then  the  attack/parry  sequence  ends  and  combat  continues  on  to  the 
participant with the next highest initiative. No opportunistic Combat Manoeuvres may be selected.

If either combatant rolls a fumble, then they must also make a roll on the fumble table appropriate 
to  their  weapon  or  combat  type.  Fumbling  during  a  combat  can  have  disastrous  results  and 
always results in a roll on the appropriate Fumble table.

There are three Fumble tables; one for Close Combat fumbles (including parries and evading), 
one for Natural Weapons and one for Ranged Weapons. When a Fumble occurs, roll on the 
appropriate Fumble table for the action involved.

No Combat Actions Remaining/Taking No Action
In a situation where a defender has no Combat Actions remaining or taking no action, or elects 
not to parry, he is treated as having automatically rolled a Failure.

Success Levels and Combat Manoeuvres
After both sides have rolled for attack and defence, compare the success levels of the attack and 
parry Skill Tests. Differences in levels of success are calculated by how many steps lie between the 
two. In other words, if both combatants roll a critical, then the difference between them is 0. 

The Levels of Success table summarises the differences in success levels depending on the attacker 
and defender’s rolls. 

Gaining a level of success over an opponent allows the combatant to perform an opportunistic 
Combat  Manoeuvre.  Combat  Manoeuvres  can  be  used  to  put  down  an  opponent  quickly,  or 
render them helpless in some other way. These are fun to use, encourage tactical thinking and 
encourage the adoption of less lethal combat resolution.

For example, an attacker rolling a critical success against the defender’s success gives the attacker a level 
of success and therefore 1 Combat Manoeuvre.

A defender rolls a success against an attacker’s fumble giving the defender two levels of success and 
therefore 2 Combat Manoeuvres.

186.204.39.123

131

For each level of success over their opponent, the winner selects a Combat Manoeuvre from 
either  the  Offensive  or  Defensive  list,  depending  on  whether  the  winner  was  attacking  or 
defending. So, for example, if the defender beats the attacker by two levels of success, then he 
chooses two manoeuvres. 

Some of the choices are common to both attack and defence – Damage Weapon, for example 
– whilst others are specific to either attack or defence. Some manoeuvres are also specific to a 
particular type or weapon; and, some manoeuvres are only available if the winner of the outcome 
has rolled a critical success.

The  Combat  Manoeuvre  chosen must be selected before any damage and/or Hit Location is 
rolled.

Some manoeuvres can be stacked. For instance, a successful attacker with two levels of success 
could choose Maximise Damage twice rather than choosing two separate offensive manoeuvres.

3 This manoeuvre is stackable.

Offensive Combat Manoeuvres
Bash  opponent  –  Attacks  can  be  used  to  deliberately  bash  the  opponent  off  balance.  The 
recipient is forced backwards by one metre for every five points (or fraction thereof) of damage 
rolled. Bashing works only on creatures up to twice the attacker’s SIZ. The calculation uses the 
damage value originally rolled by the attacker, before any subtractions due to armour, parries and 
so forth. If the bash forces the opponent into an obstacle then the recipient must make a Difficult 
(–20%) Athletics Skill Test to avoid falling prone.

Bleed  (Cutting  Weapons)  –  Causes  a  wound  that  begins  to  bleed  critically,  if  the  attack 
overcomes Armour Points and injures the target. The defender must make an opposed roll of 
Resilience vs. the attacker’s original attack roll. If the defender fails, then a major artery or vein 

132
186.204.39.123

is cut and the wound inflicts a level of Fatigue at the start of each new Combat Round. Bleeding 
wounds can be stopped by the successful use of the First Aid skill but the recipient can no longer 
participate  in  any  strenuous  or  violent  action  without  opening  the  wound  up  again.  Fatigue 
levels gained by blood loss remain until sufficient time has passed for the body to recover.

Bypass armour (Critical Success Only) – The blow finds a gap in the defender’s protection. 
This counts against worn armour or the natural skin/fur/shell of creatures. If striking a target 
that has both natural protection and wearing armour, then the attacker must decide which one is 
bypassed. Physical protection gained from magic is considered as being worn armour.

Bypass parry – The defender’s parrying weapon is treated as being one size level less. For example, 
Alaric uses Bypass Parry against a troll champion he is fighting. The troll is parrying with a glaive 
(size Large). This means that, for the purposes of parrying, the troll’s glaive is treated as size Medium 
for countering Alaric’s attack.

Change range – Allows the Adventurer to freely change the engagement range between himself 
and the opponent. This can be used to select a more favourable distance for a particular weapon, 
or even to disengage from the fight completely if desired (see Weapon Reach).

Choose location – The attacker may freely select the location where the blow lands, as long as 
that location is normally within reach.

Damage weapon (Attack and Defence) – The opponent’s weapon is damaged. The winner 
rolls the damage for his weapon and applies it to his opponent’s. The opponent’s weapon uses its 
own Armour Points for resisting the damage. If reduced to zero Hit Points the weapon breaks.

Disarm  opponent  (Attack  and  Defence)  – The  opponent  must  roll  an  opposed  test  of  his 
Combat Skill vs. the original attack roll (if the attacker won) or the original parry roll (if the 
defender won). If the recipient of the disarm fails, he loses his weapon. Two handed or entangling 
weapon wielders may add a bonus of +20% to their skill for this check. Disarming works only 
on creatures of up to twice the attacker’s STR. If the attacker has a hand free, he can grab the 
opponent’s weapon on a successful Disarm.

Entangle  (Entangling  Weapons  Only)  –  Weapons  such  as  whips  or  nets  immobilise  the 
location struck. If an arm, the target cannot use whatever he is holding; if a leg the target cannot 
manoeuvre; if the head, chest or abdomen the target suffers a –20% penalty to all activity. On 
his next action the wielder may spend a Combat Action to make an automatic Trip Opponent 
attempt.  An  entangled  opponent  can  attempt  to  break  free  by  either  pulling  the  entangling 
weapon away from the wielder with Disarm Opponent, escaping with Slip Free, or cut himself 
free using Damage weapon. 

Grip (Unarmed) – As for Pin Weapon but requires that the limb used is not holding anything. 
Being gripped prevents an opponent from disengaging by use of the Evade skill. Breaking free 
requires the spending of a CA and winning an Opposed Test of the Unarmed skill.

Impale (Thrusting Weapons Only) – Weapons such as spears or daggers may impale. Impaling 
weapons may roll damage twice with the attacker choosing which damage result to use for the 
attack. If armour is penetrated and damage results, then the attacker has the option of leaving 
the weapon in the wound, or to yank it free. Leaving the weapon in the wound inflicts a skill 
penalty; –10% per size category of the weapon (for example, –10% for small weapons such as 
arrows or daggers, –20% for medium weapons and so on). Successfully withdrawing an impaled 
weapon during melee costs a Combat Action and requires a successful Brawn roll. This causes 

186.204.39.123

133

further injury to the same location equal to the normal damage roll for that weapon but without 
any Damage Modifier. Armour does not reduce withdrawal damage. Whilst it remains impaled, 
the attacker cannot use his impaling weapon for parrying.

Maximise  damage  (Critical  Success  Only)  –  One  of  the  weapon’s  dice  automatically  does 
maximum damage. For example a warsword, which normally does 1D8 damage, would instead 
be treated as an 8 whereas a greatsword with 2D8 damage would inflict 1D8+8 damage. This 
does not affect the Damage Modifier of the attacker, which must be rolled separately.

Stun Location (Bludgeon Weapons, Attacker Only) – Weapons such as maces, hammers and 
so on, can temporarily numb the location struck. The defender must roll an opposed test of 
his Resilience vs. the original attack roll. If the defender fails, then a limb is rendered useless, a 
torso blow causes the foe to stagger winded (may only defend), or a head shot renders the foe 
unconscious. The duration of incapacitation is equal, in Combat Actions, to the damage that 
penetrated the armour. If no damage penetrated, then the impact was insufficient to stun. 

Sunder (Two-handed Weapons, Attacker Only) – Damages armour worn by the opponent. 
Apply the weapon damage (after reductions for parrying or magic) against the AP value of the 
armour. Any surplus damage in excess of the AP is then used to reduce the AP value of that 
armour location. If any damage remains after the armour has been reduced to zero AP, it carries 
over  onto  the  Hit  Points  of  the  location  struck. This  effect  may  also  be  used  on  the  natural 
armour of creatures, as the blow opens up a horrific gash in their hide, smashes chitin and so 
forth.

Trip opponent (Attack and Defence) – The opponent must roll an Opposed Test of Evade vs. 
the original attack roll (if the attacker won) or the original parry roll (if the defender won). If 
the opponent fails, he falls prone. Quadruped opponents may substitute their Athletics skill for 
Evade and gain a +20% bonus to their skill for this test.

Defensive Combat Manoeuvres
Blind Opponent (Critical Success Only) – The defender somehow blinds his opponent. It 
could be kicked sand or dust, thrown clothes, sunlight glancing off the shield, or some other 
manoeuvre that manages to blur the attacker’s vision. The Attacker makes an Opposed Test of 
his Evade skill (or Weapon style if using a shield) against the Defender’s original Parry roll. If the 
attacker fails he cannot attack for 1D3 CA.

Enhance parry – The size of the parrying weapon is treated as one step larger for the sake of 
blocking damage.

Overextend opponent – Opponent cannot attack on his next Strike Rank.

Pin Weapon (Critical Success Only) – Prevents the opponent from using the pinned weapon or 
shield, until he spends a CA to wrestle or manoeuvre the weapon free. This requires an Opposed 
Test of combat skills, the winner of which can free their weapon, or continue the pin as desired. 
If the Adventurer with the pinned weapon desires, he may substitute Brawn for his Combat 
Skill. Whilst pinned, the item may not be used for attack or defence and the foe can only avoid 
an attack by using a weapon in his other hand, disengaging completely (using the Evade skill) or 
by switching Combat Style.

Redirect blow – The Defender redirects the attack so that it strikes him in a different location, 
as long as that location is within reach of the Attacker. The Defender cannot avoid the damage; 
he merely chooses where it will land.

134
186.204.39.123

Regain  Footing  –  A  prone  or  similarly  disadvantaged  Defender  uses  the  momentum  of  the 
attack to roll back up to their feet, or grasps the Attacker’s extended limb or weapon to pull 
himself upright.

Riposte  –  The  Defender  uses  a  CA  to  make  an  immediate  counter  attack  with  one  of  his 
defending weapons or shield.

Take Weapon (Unarmed Only) – As for ‘Disarm Opponent’ but only when using Unarmed 
skill. If successful, the Defender ends up with the Attacker’s weapon in his own hands.

Slip Free – An Entangled, Gripped or Pinned character may break the hold on himself or his 
weapon.

Stand Fast – Skilful or braced footwork allows the defender to avoid the Knockback effects of 
any damage received.

Combat Manoeuvres – Optional Rule
Each time that a specific tactic is repeated during a fight, the opponent gains an additional 10% 
bonus to his next roll in the combat against the repetitive combatant – be that an opposed roll to 
resist the manoeuvre, or their next attack or parry roll. This reflects the advantage gained by the 
opponent recognising and taking advantage of the increasingly predictable strategy. The bonus 
is cumulative and does not reset until the fight (against that particular opponent) ends, even if 
other tactics are interspersed during the combat. 

Close Combat Situations

Various modifiers may be applied when using a weapon, or as the result of a Combat Manoeuvre, 
as shown on the Situational Modifiers table. These modifiers are applied to attacking, parrying 
and  evading  equally. The  skill  modifier  applies  directly  to  the  skill  in  question  and  multiple 
modifiers stack.

The following tactics and circumstances also affect Close Combat. Each has its own guidelines 
to reflect the action being undertaken.

186.204.39.123

135

Cover
If a target is in cover or partially covered by an object (such as a wall, door or fence), any attack 
that hits a covered location will instead hit the object. See Inanimate Objects on page 91. Cover 
affects both Ranged and Close Combat attacks.

The normal way of negating cover is to use the Choose Location Combat Manoeuvre to aim 
at the visible parts of the target – or to strike through the cover if the weapon is capable of 
penetrating it. 

If the cover is total but the attacker knows his attack will penetrate the cover, he cannot use 
Choose Location to target a specific location and must rely on randomly determining a location 
(using 1D20) as per normal. In addition, the attacker suffers a –40% penalty to his attack. Note 
that this only applies where the Attacker:

Is 100% certain that the target is behind the cover.

•	
•	 The cover is not so extensive as to permit the target to move freely behind it.

Thus, a target lurking behind a bush can still be attacked, even though the attacker might not be 
able to see his quarry. However a target behind a lengthy hedgerow is completely obscured and 
the attack will automatically fail.

Evading 
Some attacks such as missile fire, destructive spells, charging creatures or even dragon’s breath, 
can be very difficult to avoid. In these circumstances all an Adventurer can do is hurl himself to 
the ground, or dive behind cover to escape the effects. 

Evasion attempts are always treated as Opposed Tests, pitting the relevant attack skill against the 
Evade skill of the Defender. If the Attacker wins then inflict damage as normal. If the Defender 
wins damage is completely avoided. Whatever the result, the evasive gambit momentarily places 
the Defender at a disadvantage as he regains his balance, preventing him from performing an 
attack with the CA available on their next Strike Rank. 

If the winner of the Opposed Test achieves one or more levels of success over his opponent, the 
result of the roll may be modified by applicable Combat Manoeuvres as per normal combat.

Some circumstances prevent a character from evading:

•	 The Adventurer is helpless or prone.
•	 There is nowhere to evade to (balancing on a rope above a lake of lava, for example).
•	 A  mounted  Adventurer  may  evade  only  by  rolling  out  of  the  saddle,  automatically 

dismounting.

If an Adventurer is facing a close combat attack against which he has no applicable defence – 
either because his weapon has been broken, dropped or because the attacking weapon is simply 
too big to successfully parry – then he may choose to defend himself by using Evade. However, 
using Evade as a melee defence involves giving ground or leaping aside, placing the Defender at 
a disadvantage. 

136
186.204.39.123

Knockback
Any attack which causes more damage than the SIZ of the recipient automatically results in 
a  knockback. The  recipient  must  immediately  make  an  Athletics  test  to  avoid  falling  prone 
from  the  force  of  the  blow.  He  is  also  shoved  one  metre  for  each  five  points  of  damage  (or 
fraction thereof) exceeding the target’s SIZ. This calculation uses the original damage roll before 
subtractions due to parrying and armour.
 
Note that Knockback is different than the Bash Combat Manoeuvre. A Bash is a deliberate tactic 
based on timing and technique, whereas a Knockback is the accidental side effect of awesomely 
powerful blows. The former is not directly affected by SIZ, whereas the latter is.

Leaping Attacks
Some creatures leap upon their targets in order to knock them prone. A leaping attack requires 
a Combat Action to initiate, using an Opposed Test of the creature’s Athletics skill against the 
Defender’s Evade skill. The Defender may also Parry with a shield if he has one ready. If the 
leaper wins the test then the Defender is knocked prone and cannot recover his feet for the next 
1D3 Combat Actions. Otherwise he suffers no other damage. If the Defender is a quadruped, 
then it may substitute Athletics for Evade and gain a +20% bonus to roll to avoid falling over. 

A leaping attack only affects targets less than twice the SIZ of the Attacker.

Mounted Combat
Whilst  mounted,  the  combat  skills  of  a  warrior  cannot  exceed  the  value  of  the  Ride  skill. 
However, the warrior gains the following benefits:
 
•	 A mounted warrior rolls a 1D10+10 for Hit Location if using a small or medium weapon. 
•	 Using a CA the rider may substitute either his own Combat Style or Ride skill instead 

of his mount’s, to defend the mount against attacks. 

•	 The warrior may add the SIZ of his mount to his own for the purposes of avoiding 

Knockback, as long as he can make a successful unopposed Ride Skill Test. 

•	 He can use the Damage Modifier of his mount instead of his own when charging with a 
braced weapon. A weapon braced for a charging attack cannot be used for defence until 
the charge has been completed. Weapons which impale during a charge remain in the 
body of their target and will be lost if the mount continues past (See Charging).

Multiple Opponents
No penalties are suffered if facing multiple opponents. The inherent disadvantage occurs simply 
in the fact that the combatant will become swamped by his enemies and run out of Combat 
Actions for parrying before his attackers run out of attacks. An attack against an opponent who 
cannot parry treats the Defender, by default, as having automatically failed their roll.

If outnumbered in an environment where movement is still possible (not pinned against a wall or 
forced into a corner, for example), a Defender may expend a Combat Acton to outmanoeuvre his foes 
for the remainder of that round. The attackers participate in a single (group) Opposed roll matching 
their Evade skill against the Evade skill of the Defender. Those who fail to beat the Defender cannot 
attack  that  round,  as  they  become  blocked  by  the  position  of  their  allies. Those  opponents  who 
win against the Defender may freely attack as per normal. Unless the Defender wishes to disengage 
entirely and run away, the number of opponents cannot be reduced to less than one.
 

186.204.39.123

137

An example of how this works in practice would be a swashbuckler using the tables, chairs, stairs and 
chandeliers in a tavern to block his multiple foes, whilst he whittles them away one-by-one.
 
Multiple Opponents – Optional Rule
Constant manoeuvring in combat is extremely exhausting. At the end of each round it occurs, 
the  Defender  must  make  an  Opposed  roll  of  Athletics  versus  the  best  Athletics  skill  of  the 
attackers. If failed, the Defender gains a new level of fatigue. Eventually even the greatest fighters 
can be worn down.

Pulled Blows
Sometimes an Adventurer wants to hurt or incapacitate, but not maim or kill, his opponent. 
By  using  Pulled  Blows,  which  also  includes  using  the  flat  of  a  blade,  as  well  as  limiting  the 
force applied, the Adventurer can deliberately halve the damage inflicted for a successful hit. 
The Adventurer must declare that he is pulling a blow before making the attack; otherwise the 
damage is applied as per a normal attack.

Surprise 
Surprise is gained when one side in a combat manages to launch an attack without the other side 
being aware of the intention and is thus unprepared for it. A carefully staged ambush is the most 
common situation for surprise to occur but there will be other circumstances.

A surprised Adventurer is one who:

•	 Has completely failed to notice an impending attack through a Perception roll.
•	

Is attacked when completely unprepared (asleep, perhaps, or absorbed with another activity). 
In these circumstances modifiers to combat rolls reflecting the surprised Adventurer’s status 
(a –20% penalty for a freshly awoken and groggy character, for example) may apply. 

The effects of surprise are as follows:

•	 The surprised party suffers an immediate –10 to his Initiative for this round of combat. For 

the following round Initiative is determined as normal. 

•	 The  surprised  party  is  only  able  to  use  CA  to  defend  against  attacks  (not  make  them), 
including Evading, for this round, and can only use CA in response to attacks made after 
his own Strike Rank. 

Unarmed Combat
Adventurers or creatures who can reach an opponent with their natural weapons may use their 
Unarmed skill interchangeably with any other weapon style they may be using. Punches, kicks, 
head-butts and all other Unarmed attacks do 1D3 points of damage.

Users who succeed in an opposed unarmed attack may either: inflict damage, establish a grapple, 
or break free. Grappling can only occur if the appendage being used is empty and capable of 
gripping. The effects of a grapple depend on the location held. Grappling a limb prevents that 
limb being used to attack, defend or move. Grappling the head or torso inflicts a –20% penalty 
to  all  activity  attempted  by  the  victim.  Combatants  with  a  poor  unarmed  combat  skill  may 
instead substitute their Brawn skill to maintain or break free of grapples.

138
186.204.39.123

Once  the  grapple  is  established  it  continues  automatically  until  the  grappler  lets  go  or  the 
opponent  breaks  free.  Whilst  the  hold  is  maintained,  on  his  Strike  Rank  the  grappler  may 
make unarmed attacks to inflict damage on the location held, by gauging, twisting, crushing or 
strangulating the location. The Defender may oppose with his Unarmed or Brawn skill in order 
to reduce or block the damage.

Unusual Combat Conditions
Whilst climbing  an  Adventurer’s Combat Skill cannot exceed the value of his Athletics  skill. 
Bipedal Adventurers may only use a single limb to attack or defend, requiring the others to cling 
to the surface they are scaling.
 
Whilst swimming an Adventurer’s Combat Skill cannot exceed the value of his Swimming skill. 
Only thrusting weapons capable of impaling can be used successfully when immersed in water 
and those will only inflict half damage. All other weapons are impotent. Natural attacks which 
involve ramming, biting or strangulation are unaffected.

Weapon Reach – Closing and Disengaging
Weapon  Reach,  Closing  and  Disengaging  are  optional  rules  for  those  desiring  more  realistic 
combat. Roughly speaking, a weapon has a reach equivalent to its size. In circumstances where 
the size of combatants’ weapons are different in length by two or more steps, then the wielder 
with the shorter reach cannot directly attack the opponent with the longer reach. They are, quite 
simply, out of range.

The threat of longer reach is one of the advantages granted by two handed weapons, offsetting 
some of the benefits lost by not using a shield. The only method of overcoming this situation is 
if the wielder with the shorter reach closes on their opponent.

Although a combatant may be out of range, unable to hit their opponent, they can reverse the 
situation by the use of Combat Manoeuvres… such as endeavouring to disarm or damage the 
opponent’s weapon; or by changing the engagement distance. 

In the case of huge monsters using unarmed combat, the appendage being used to strike with can 
be targeted directly and in this case there are no hindrances to counter attack it.

Closing
An Adventurer whose reach is two sizes less than their opponent, needs to actively close into 
Close  Combat  range,  otherwise  remain  unable  to  strike  at  them.  Closing  on  an  opponent 
requires a Combat Action (if not taking advantage of a Combat Manoeuvre) and requires the 
opponent to decide whether he wishes to counter the closing action, or whether to strike at the 
closer instead. Either option uses a Combat Action.

If the opponent decides to counter the closing action, then the closer and the opponent make an 
Opposed Test using their Evade skills. The winner either closes or maintains distance as desired. 

However, if the opponent decides to use the closing action to take an attack instead, then the 
opponent resists the Evade Opposed Test with his Combat Skill. Whether or not he is hit, the 
closer succeeds in reaching Close Combat distance.

186.204.39.123

139

Once within the reach of the opponent’s weapon, the advantage switches to the wielder of the 
shorter weapon. The opponent now cannot parry with his weapon until he reopens the distance.

Disengaging
Adventurers that have been closed upon by opponents with a shorter reach are at a serious 
tactical disadvantage. Their only escape is to disengage from combat and in so doing, restore 
the  original  range  between  them.  This  works  in  exactly  the  same  manner  as  Closing.  To 
disengage requires a Combat Action (again, if not taking advantage of a Combat Manoeuvre) 
and  the  opponent  must  decide  whether  he  wants  to  remain  in  Close  Combat  distance,  or 
whether to take an attack at the disengaging combatant instead. Either option also requires a 
Combat Action to use.
 
If the opponent decides to remain in close combat, then the disengaging combatant and the 
opponent  make  an  Opposed Test  using  their  Evade  skills. The  winner  of  the  contest  either 
retreats or maintains distance as desired. However, if the opponent decides to use the disengaging 
action to take a free attack instead, he resists the Evade Opposed Test with his combat skill. 
Whether or not the blow lands, the disengagement succeeds and the advantage returns to the 
combatant with the longer reach.

Ranged Attacks

Ranged weapons include bows, slings and thrown melee weapons such as spears and daggers. 
Just as with close combat, ranged combat participants use the skill or style associated with 
their ranged weapon to attempt a successful attack – as long as they are within range of the 
target.

Ranged attacks can usually only be parried by shields: Defenders lacking a shield have the option 
to dive for cover using Evade (see page 136). What this means is that, unless an opponent can 
take evasive action or parry, an aAttacker using a ranged weapon has an immediate advantage 
because attacks that are undefended automatically gain the aAttacker an appropriate Combat 
Manoeuvre. This is a deliberate design mechanic highlighting the potential lethality of ranged 
weapons in the hands of a competent warrior.

Certain specific notes concerning ranged attacks are as follows:

Aiming
By increasing the amount of time spent in aiming a missile weapon, an Adventurer can increase 
his chance to hit. For every Combat Action that an Adventurer spends aiming, he gains a bonus 
to his Ranged Weapon skill equal to his critical range (10%) in that skill. For example, Alaric 
has 3 CA and has Sling 46%. By aiming for two CA he would gain two additional +5% bonuses, 
taking his chance to hit to 56%.

Loading Ranged Weapons
When a ranged weapon is readied, it is either in hand (for throwing weapons) or loaded (for 
bows and other projectile weapons). While readying most ranged weapons takes only a single 
Combat Action, others may take more. The number of Combat Actions it takes to load a ranged 
weapon is listed in its statistical entry in the Ranged Weapons table, page 109.

are cumulative. Therefore, shooting at a target within a mist that has moved more than 10m

2 Attacker condition modifiers are cumulative.

Damage Modifier
If an Adventurer’s Damage Modifier can be applied to the damage of a ranged weapon, this is 
stipulated in that weapon’s entry on the Ranged Weapons table in the Equipment chapter.

Firing into a Crowd
When firing a ranged weapon into a crowd, Close Combat or any group where the target is 
adjacent to one or more other potential targets, there is always a chance the Attacker will hit 
someone other than the target he was aiming at.

When firing into a crowd, the Games Master should determine which locations of the target 
have cover from the ranged attack. The ranged attack is then resolved as normal for a target 
behind cover (see page 136).

If a covered location is hit by the attack, the firer has hit one of the individuals adjacent to the 
target (the Games Master will decide who). The accidental target may try to evade or parry this 
attack as normal. If the attack damages the accidental target, roll the Hit Location randomly.

186.204.39.123

141

86.204.39.123

If the accidental target successfully evades a ranged attack, the projectile continues on its original 
path and may strike the intended target. The intended target may also attempt to evade or parry 
the attack as normal.

Firing on the Move
Ranged weapons can be used from horseback or chariots but the chance of success cannot exceed 
the  Attacker’s  skill  with  either  Ride  or  Drive,  as  appropriate.  If  an  Attacker  is  running  then 
his attack percentage cannot exceed his Athletics skill. Ranged attacks may not be used if the 
attacker himself (rather than a mount) is charging. 

Impaling Ranged Attacks
An Adventurer that impales an enemy with a Ranged attack (a thrown spear or fired arrow) 
obviously does not have the option of immediately attempting to yank out the projectile.

Range
A target within the weapon’s Range may be attacked without penalty. A target within double the 
weapon’s Range may be attacked but the Attacker’s effective Weapon skill is halved (before other 
modifiers are applied). Attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s Range automatically fail.

Full-Round Manoeuvres

Some  manoeuvres  take  up  almost  all  of  an  Adventurer’s  effort  and  attention  in  combat.  An 
Adventurer  who  makes  a  Full-Round  Manoeuvre  must  dedicate  all  but  one  of  his  Combat 
Actions  for  the  round  to  the  manoeuvres  (usually  moving).  Full-round  manoeuvres  must  be 
declared when the Adventurer first acts in the round.

Full-round manoeuvres include:
•	 Charging (below): The Adventurer moves a total of 3x his normal Movement and attacks 
along the way. During the round, all the Adventurer’s Combat Actions but one must be 
spent on Move, but in each action he moves up to 2x his normal Movement.
Sprinting (see page 93): The Adventurer moves up to 5x his normal Movement. During 
the round, all the Adventurer’s Combat Actions but one must be spent on Move but in each 
action he moves up to 3x his normal Movement.

•	

For example, Alaric is in the middle of a pitched battle between his clan and another band of barbarians. 
He is currently unengaged with any particular foe as the battle swirls around him. In the distance, he 
sees Thrace being menaced by a trio of foes. Alaric decides to sprint to his friend’s side. At the start of the 
next round, when it is Alaric’s turn to act, he declares that he will spend this round Sprinting. Alaric’s 
movement allowance for this round increases to 40m (5x his normal Movement of 8m). For his first 
Combat Action, Alaric moves 16m. For his second, he moves 16m. He still has one Combat Action left, 
and as he has spent all but one of his Combat Actions on moving and thus fulfilled the requirements for 
Sprinting, he can spend this last Combat Action to move 8m and make a sling attack on his foes. 
 
Charging
Charging gains a number of benefits but is subject to a number of additional rules:
 
•	 During the round in which he charges, all of the Adventurer’s Combat Actions but one 

must be spent on Move, but in each action he moves up to 2x his normal Movement.

•	 During a charge a bipedal creature improves its Damage Modifier by one step. Quadruped 
creatures improve their Damage Modifier by two steps. For example, a charging horse with 
a Damage Modifier of +1D6 would improve its Damage Modifier to +1D10.

186.204.39.123

143

•	 The recipient of a charge has the choice of either standing firm to receive the charge, or 

•	

attempting to evade the charge. 
Standing firm allows the recipient the opportunity to strike at the charging opponent but 
he will potentially suffer the brunt of the charge attack, usually resulting in serious damage 
and/or  knockback.  If  the  opponent  is  mounted  they  might  also  face  a  potential  further 
attack from the mount or be trampled by it. Unlike normal initiative, whichever combatant 
has the longest reach attacks first (see Weapon Reach). 

•	

•	 Evading the charge permits the recipient to make an Opposed Test of his Evade skill verses 
the charging opponent’s attack skill or Combat Style (as required). If the recipient wins he 
throws himself completely clear of the charging opponent (and the mount if they are riding 
one). If he loses he is instead caught at an inopportune moment and is treated as being 
defenceless. Using Evade prevents the recipient from making a counter attack. 
If the recipient possesses a long shafted impaling weapon (such as a two handed spear or 
polearm) he may set it against the charge and use the Damage Modifier of the charging 
opponent (or its mount if the opponent is riding) instead of his own. 

•	 Any charge made against a static formation of defenders, which does not inflict Knockback 
on  the  target,  staggers  the  charging  creature  into  immobility.  The  charger  can  also  be 
stopped if one of its legs is incapacitated (assuming it does not have six or more legs!). 

•	

•	 A mounted Adventurer has the choice of continuing (if he has enough movement left to get 
clear of the enemy’s Weapon Reach) after the Combat Action or stopping. If the charging 
Adventurer is on foot, then the defender may choose to let the charger continue; if he does 
not, then the charger is now engaged with the Defender and must stop moving. 
If the charging creature continues, the charge only allows a single Combat Action for the 
Attacker, their mount (if combat capable) and the Defender during that round, because the 
speed of the charging creature carries it clear of the engagement zone. The recipient of a 
charge may not make a further ‘Free’ Attack if the charger continues past and away, since 
charging is different from disengaging.
If the charging creature stops, he is now engaged in Close Combat with his opponent.

•	
 
Treat Flyby Attacks the same as Charging.

Damage and Wound Levels

If an attack strikes successfully, it causes damage according to the damage rating for the weapon 
(see the statistical entries for Close Combat and Ranged weapons in the Equipment chapter, 
pages 101 and 107). A shortsword, for instance, inflicts 1D6 damage.

The rolled damage for the weapon or attack is modified in the following ways:

•	 Add or subtract the Damage Modifier for the Adventurer making the attack.
•	 Modify the damage from any weapon enhancing (or reducing) magic.
•	

If parried, reduce the damage appropriately.

If a Hit Location is armoured (physically and/or magically), subtract the Armour Points value.

Hit Locations
A successful attack damages a specific Hit Location. To determine which location has been hit, 
roll 1D20 and compare the number rolled with the Humanoid Hit Location table.

144
186.204.39.123

Some unusual creatures have slightly different Hit Location tables to reflect their own unique 
physiology. Such creatures have their modified Hit Location tables listed with their description.

If  the  damage  inflicted  by  the  attack  is  above  zero,  then  the  Hit  Location  sustains  that 
amount of damage, with the damage total being immediately removed from the location’s 
Hit Points. Note how many Hit Points the location has remaining and the wound category 
that results.

Use  the  following  rules  if  a  location  receives  a  Serious  or  Major  wound.  Note  that  wounds 
requiring Resilience checks must test them in an Opposed Test against the value of the original 
attack  roll.  This  reflects  the  ability  of  highly  skilled  warriors  to  make  more  deadly  strikes. 
Resilience rolls are not repeated unless the location is wounded again.

Minor Wound (Hit Location has positive Hit Points)
Minor wounds are cuts, scratches, bruises and contusions. They hurt, they may bleed but are not 
significant enough to slow down or hamper the victim.

Serious Wound (Hit Location is Zero Hit Points or 
Below)
If a location is reduced to zero Hit Points or below, the victim receives a Serious Wound. The 
location is permanently scarred and the victim cannot attack (but can still parry or evade) for the 
next 1D3 Combat Actions due to being stunned or distracted by the pain of the wound. 

An Adventurer suffering a Serious Wound to a limb must immediately make an Opposed Test 
of his Resilience versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in the limb being 
rendered useless, until the location is restored to positive Hit Points. If a leg, the victim drops 
prone. If an arm, he drops whatever he is holding unless the object is strapped on (use common 
sense here). 

An Adventurer suffering a Serious Wound to the Abdomen, Chest or Head must immediately 
make an Opposed Test of his Resilience versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure 
results in unconsciousness for a number of minutes equal to the amount of damage sustained 
in  the  attack  causing  the  Serious Wound.  First  Aid  or  Healing  skills  can  be  used  to  help  an 
unconscious victim regain consciousness but he will not be able to rejoin any combat until he 
has received further healing to the Seriously Wounded location. 

186.204.39.123

145

Major Wound (Hit Location has lost twice its starting 
Hit Points)
If  a  location  is  reduced  to  a  negative  score  equal  or  greater  than  it’s  starting  Hit  Points,  the 
Adventurer receives a Major Wound. The location is permanently maimed and the Adventurer 
is immediately incapacitated, unable to continue fighting.

A limb is considered to be severed, transfixed, shattered or ripped off by a Major Wound. The 
Adventurer drops prone, physically incapacitated and must immediately make an Opposed Test 
of Resilience versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in unconsciousness 
from the agony. If a severed, punctured or ripped-off location is not treated within a number of 
minutes equal to the Adventurer’s CON+POW, the Adventurer dies from blood loss and shock.

The  victim  of  a  Major  Wound  to  the  Abdomen,  Chest  or  Head  drops  unconscious,  totally 
incapacitated and must immediately make an Opposed Test of Resilience versus the successful 
attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in an instant and gratuitous death (decapitated, chopped 
in half, impaled through the heart, torn apart and so forth). If he survives and the location is not 
treated within a number of rounds equal to half the Adventurer’s CON+POW, he still dies from 
blood loss and shock.

Since most Major Wounds require some form of surgery or major magic to heal, the sufferer will 
be very unlikely to recover from a major wound in time to rejoin combat. 

Heroic Last Actions
In special cases where key Adventurers receive a Major Wound, the Games Master might allow 
a heroic last action – such as spitting out one last spell, attempting to cut down their slayer, 
crawling away to hide, or trying to tourniquet their own wound. They must have working limbs 
applicable to the action and burn a Hero Point. They get a single opportunity to attempt their 
desire and then immediately collapse into unconsciousness and probable death.

Optional Combat Rules For Non-Player 
Characters

One of the most time consuming elements of handling Non-Player Characters (NPCs), such as 
monsters, enemies and so on is keeping track of locational Hit Points during a fight, especially 
where  several  NPCs  are  involved. This  can  become  confusing  and  often  slows-down  a  game 
considerably. Legend offers are several optional ways of dealing with this issue.

General Hit Points
First, reserve locational Hit Points for major villains and enemies. For all other foes, use General 
Hit  Points  instead.  General  Hit  Points  are  calculated  on  the  average  of  the  CON  and  SIZ 
Characteristics, rather than on their sum. So, a foe with CON 12 and SIZ 16 would have 14 Hit 
Points (12+16, divided by 2).

•	 Every NPC has a ‘Critical Wound’ rating equal to half the General Hit Points (rounded up). 

Thus, in our example, a foe with 14 HP has a Critical Wound rating of 7.

•	 Weapon  damage  is  removed  directly  from  the  Hit  Point  total.  When  Hit  Points  reach 
zero, the NPC must make a Resilience test to remain conscious. If the test is successful a 
Resilience test must be made every combat round until Hit Points are brought up to 1 or 
more. If the NPC loses consciousness, death results within a number of Combat Actions 
equal to the Critical Wound value, unless Hit Points are brought up to 1 HP or more.

146
186.204.39.123

•	

•	

•	
•	

If General Hit Points are reduced to a negative amount equal to the Critical Wound rating 
or more death is instantaneous. In our example, if the foe sustains 14 or more points of 
damage, he dies automatically.
If the NPC suffers a single wound that exceeds his Critical Wound rating in one blow, the 
Games Master may make a roll on the Critical Wound table to determine what additional 
effects are suffered. The armour value being worn is subtracted from the D20 roll.
If the blow inflicted by the Adventurer is a Critical Hit, add the damage to the 1D20 roll.
In addition to the effects detailed in the Critical Wound table, the target always receives an 
impressive-looking scar as a permanent reminder of the experience.

eye and so forth.
A vital location is struck (heart, throat, brain and so 
on) and target dies instantly!

Example:  Alaric  is  battling  a  broo. The  broo  has  12  General  Hits  Points  and  wears  3  points  of 
armour. On the first blow Alaric hits and inflicts 7 points of damage (after armour has been taken 
into account), which exceeds the broo’s Critical Wound level of 6. The Games Master rolls 1D20 and 
scores 13. This is reduced to 10, taking into account the broo’s armour. The broo is dazed (losing its 
next Combat Action) and needs to make a Resilience test (which it does) to avoid unconsciousness.

On the next blow Alaric again scores a hit, delivering a further 5 points of damage. The broo is now 
reduced to zero Hit Points. Since it has been reduced to zero Hit Points it must make another Resilience 
roll or fall unconscious. This time it fails and Alaric spends his next action to give it a coup-de-grace.

186.204.39.123

147

Underlings
Underlings are competent but inconsequential foes usually sent en-masse to harass Adventurers. 
A simple way to handle fights involving lots of underlings is to radically adjust Hit Points to lend 
the advantage to the Adventurer. Whilst they still have combat abilities and can dispense damage 
as easily as anyone else (and indeed, they should certainly try), they are there to be sword-fodder 
for the heroes of the story. If you choose the Underlings option:

•	 Underlings  have  a  number  of  Hit  Points  equal  to  their  CON  divided  by  2.  Damage  is 
sustained as normal, with armour protecting but when Hit Points reach zero, the Underling 
is dead.

•	 A Critical hit inflicted by an Adventurer always incapacitates an Underling, rendering it 

unconscious. No Resilience roll is necessary.
If half the Underlings’ number is incapacitated, the rest flee.

•	

Use this option only when the Adventurers are facing a ravening horde of relatively inconsequential 
adversaries which are, to all intents and purposes, completely expendable. Competent NPCs and 
major villains should be treated differently.

Alaric’s Tale – The Goblin Fight

This part of Alaric’s Tale continues the description of the battle with the three goblins, picking-
up after Initiative and Combat Actions have been determined. The example uses the full combat 
rules and does not use the Optional Combat Rules from page 146.

Our heroes are facing three angry goblins.

Alaric is armed with a short spear (1D8+1damage, Size Medium, Reach Long, 4 AP and 5 HP) 
and a heater shield (1D4 damage, Size Large). His combat style is Spear and Shield at 80%. As 
Alaric uses a shield he gains an additional CA, bringing his CA total to 4.

Lilina is armed with a long sword (1D8 damage, used one-handed, Size Medium, Reach Long, 
6 AP and 12 HP) and a heater (1D4 damage, Size Large). Her combat style is Sword and Shield 
at 64%. As she uses a shield she gains a CA, bringing her total to 3.

Thrace is armed with a long spear (1D10+1 damage, , Size Large, Reach Very Long, 4 AP and 
10 HP). His Combat Style is Spear 58%. As he uses only one weapon, he gains no additional 
CA so his CA total remains at 2.

The goblins are armed with short swords (1D6 damage, Size Medium, Reach Short, 6 AP and 8 
HP) and bucklers (1D3 damage, Size Medium). They all have the same combat style of Sword 
and Shield at 50% and gain a CA for this style, bringing their CA total to 3.

Having determined the order of Initiative, by Strike Rank, and knowing how many Combat 
Actions each participant in the fight has, the first round of combat begins.

The Games Master asks each Adventurer, in Strike Rank order, what they intend to do in this 
first round of combat. Lilina says she will attack the closest of the three goblins with her sword, 
defending with her shield. Alaric says he will attack the larger of the goblins, attacking with his 

148
186.204.39.123

spear and defending with his shield. The Games Master states that the three goblins are prepared 
for a fight and are closing for the attack. Two goblins have singled-out Alaric, as the largest of the 
humans and one is advancing on Lilina. Thrace says he is intending to try to circle around the 
group of goblins to try and take the pair attacking Alaric by surprise.

First Combat Round
Lilina acts first on Strike Rank 20 and rolls for her Sword and Shield, scoring 55 – a successful 
hit. This costs her one of her 3 CA. The goblin attempts a parry, rolling 12 – a successful parry. 
There is no difference in the success levels, so neither gains a Combat Manoeuvre; however, 
Lilina can roll damage, scoring 7 with her 1D8 longsword damage. Her sword is Medium Size 
and the goblin’s buckler is the same: he counters all Lilina’s damage with his shield and has spent 
one of his CA doing so. The action now passes to Alaric on Strike Rank 19.

Alaric faces two of the goblins and singles out the meaner-looking of the two for a lunge with 
his spear, rolling 94 – a miss. This costs him one CA. The goblin was attempting to parry with 
its buckler and scores 19 – a successful parry. The goblin has one level of success better than 
Alaric (a successful defence against a failed attack) and so gains a Combat Manoeuvre chosen 
from the Defensive options. The goblin chooses ‘Trip Opponent’. Alaric is caught by surprise 
by the goblin’s sudden sidestep and must roll against his Evade skill against the goblin’s original 
parry of 19 to avoid losing balance. With a 46 Alaric succeeds and easily wins the Opposed Test, 
thankfully remaining upright. The action now passes to the three goblins on Strike Rank 14.

The goblin facing Lilina has two CA remaining to use this round and makes an attack with its 
short sword, rolling 39 – a success. Lilina has already said that she is parrying and uses a CA to 
do so, rolling 69 – a failure. The goblin has thus achieved one level of success over Lilina and 
can both inflict damage and select a Combat Manoeuvre. The manoeuvre must be chosen before 
damage is rolled and it opts for Impale. This manoeuvre lets the goblin roll damage twice, taking 
the best result: it rolls 5 and a 4, so the goblin retains the first roll. He thrusts his sword into 
Lilina’s right arm (a roll of 13 on 1D20). Lilina’s armour on this location is leather, offering only 
1 AP of protection. She therefore takes 4 points of damage to her right arm and, as she only has 3 
HP in this location, sustains a Serious Wound (her right arm HP are now –1) and cannot attack 
for the next 1D3 Combat Actions. However, the Impale result for the goblin allows it to either 
leave its sword embedded in her arm or withdraw it, causing further damage, if the goblin can 
succeed in a Brawn roll. This costs it another CA, meaning that it has used all three of its CA for 
this round but the Brawn roll is a success. The goblin inflicts a further 1D6 damage, with the 
lucky result of 1, taking Lilina’s right arm down to –2 HP. Her wound level remains at Serious for 
that location and she must make an Opposed Test of her Resilience against the goblin’s successful 
attack roll. Her Resilience is 45% and she rolls 53, failing. Her arm is badly injured and drops 
her long sword from pain, her arm rendered useless until healed. 

The action now passes to the two goblins tackling Alaric. The meanest looking goblin has two 
CA remaining, having parried Alaric’s spear lunge and the other has three CA. Alaric has three 
CA left this round and will defend against both his foes.

The mean looking goblin slashes with its short sword scoring 53, a miss. Alaric is parrying and 
so still rolls. His roll is 59, a success, and gains a defensive manoeuvre. He chooses Pin Weapon, 

186.204.39.123

149

slamming his shield onto the goblin’s sword blade and wedging it against the ground. The mean 
goblin needs to spend a CA to free its weapon but must wait until his Strike Rank comes round 
again. Until freed, the mean goblin cannot attack with its pinned sword.

The second of the two facing Alaric also lashes out with its short sword. Alaric spends his third 
CA to parry and fails but fortunately the goblin rolls 00 – a fumble! As neither succeeded in their 
rolls, Alaric does not get a defensive manoeuvre – but since the goblin has fumbled, it must roll 
on the Close Combat Fumble table. The 1D20 result is 4 – the goblin’s sword slips from its grasp 
and lands a metre distant. Although it cannot attack with the sword until it is recovered, it can 
still use its buckler to hit him instead, if it wishes.

The Initiative moves now to Strike Rank 11 and Thrace, who is yet to act. Thrace asks the Games 
Master if he has seen what is happening with Lilina and can he do anything about it? The Games 
Master rules that, as Thrace has not done anything yet and because Lilina is quite close, Thrace 
can act against the goblin that has injured her. He thus makes an attack against it.

The goblin has spent all its CA for this round and so cannot parry Thrace’s attack. The Games 
Master also rules that Thrace is coming at the goblin from the side and awards Thrace a +20% 
bonus for flanking. Thrace now rolls against an adjusted skill of 78% and scores 06 – a critical 
success! With the goblin’s automatic failure to defend, Thrace has two levels of success, resulting 
in two Combat Manoeuvres. And, with a critical roll, Thrace can select from those manoeuvres 
that  can  only  be  made  on  a  critical  success.  Thrace  chooses  Bypass  Armour  and  Maximise 
Damage. The first manoeuvre means that the goblin’s scraps of armour, wherever they might be, 
will not protect it. Maximise Damage ensures Thrace’s long spear will inflict its full 11 points of 
damage, in addition Thrace also adds his +1D2 Damage Modifier, which he must roll, for a total 
of 13 damage. The Hit Location he rolls is 11 – Chest. Thrace drives his spear straight between 
the goblin’s ribs: the amount of damage results in a Major Wound which, for the chest, means 
the goblin must match its Resilience of 38% against Thrace’s attack score of 06. To survive, the 
goblin must roll a critical success on its Resilience and gain a higher roll than 06. As this is plainly 
impossible to do with a 38% Resilience, the goblin screams as Thrace plunges the spear into its 
heart and dies instantly.

The action has now cycled through each participant in Strike Rank order. The Games Master 
quickly notes CA remaining for each combatant:

Lilina – 3 CA but has spent two and cannot attack on her next Strike Rank due to her wounded 
arm. She has one CA remaining in this Combat Round.

Alaric – 4 CA and has used three: one attack and two parries.

Goblins – the one who attacked Lilina is dead. The mean-looking one has its sword pinned to 
the ground by Alaric’s shield but has one CA remaining. The other goblin who dropped its sword 
has two CA remaining.

Thrace – has one CA remaining and has saved Lilina in spectacular fashion.

150
186.204.39.123

Alaric can now act with his fourth CA. With one goblin pinned and the second weaponless, 
Alaric thrusts his spear at the mean goblin. The goblin can only parry with its buckler and uses 
its last CA to defend itself. Alaric rolls 24, a success, and the goblin fails to parry. Alaric receives 
one Combat Manoeuvre and chooses Impale. He thrusts his spear into the goblin’s abdomen (9 
on 1D20). Of the two rolls for damage – 3 on the first and 8 on the second, he naturally chooses 
the 8 result. His Damage Modifier of +1D2 takes the overall damage to 10 points. With only 2 
AP protecting its stomach and 5HP in that location, the goblin is reduced to –3 HP: a Serious 
Wound. This forces the goblin to immediately make an Opposed Test of its Resilience versus 
Alaric’s successful attack roll of 24. The goblin’s Resilience is 38% but it fails with a 69, falling 
unconscious from the shock and pain. The mean goblin is out of the fight.

However the goblin that lost its sword bears down on Alaric and prepares to make an Unarmed 
Attack. Alaric’s spear is still rammed into the mean goblin’s chest up to its crossbar but since he 
has no CA remaining he cannot parry anyway. The goblin’s Unarmed is 33% and its scores 09 
– a success. Alaric is treated as automatically failing. The goblin selects Disarm Opponent as his 
offensive manoeuvre and Alaric makes an Opposed Test of his weapon skill against the goblin’s 
original attack of 09. He rolls 98% and is shocked when his shield is ripped out of his grasp, 
incidentally taking 2 HP damage to his shield arm from the goblin’s claws!

Action moves back to Thrace and his final CA for the round. He sees that Alaric has his spear 
jammed into a possibly dead goblin whilst being battered by another. He also has enough room 
to Charge – but he can’t Charge this round, as Charging is a Full-Round Manoeuvre that has 
to be declared at the start of a round. He could just move up and attack the goblin, but Thrace 
wants the damage bonus from charging. Instead, he casts a quick Magnitude 2 Bladesharp spell 
on his spear.  As the spell’s casting time is equal to half its Magnitude, it takes only one Combat 
Action to cast, and gives a +10% bonus to hit and a +2 bonus to damage.

Second Combat Round
Usually Initiative is maintained for a fresh round but given that two goblins are down, and Lilina 
hurt, the Games Master calls for new Initiative rolls. The outcome is:

Alaric 20
Goblin 18
Thrace 17
Lilina 16

Thus, Alaric acts first.

With a goblin bearing down on him and his spear still stuck, Alaric decides to cast a Dragon 
Breath spell that he recently learned instead of attacking with a weapon. This Common Magic 
spell only takes 1 CA to cast and so takes effect, if successful, on this CA. Alaric rolls against his 
Common Magic of 64% and scores 28 – a success. Alaric’s chest swells and he exudes a burst of 
flame at the goblin bearing over him. The goblin unwittingly tries to parry this magical fire with 
its buckler, immediately failing and thus grants Alaric a combat manoeuvre: he chooses Choose 
Location and directs the burst of fire straight into the goblin’s face. Dragon Breath inflicts 1D10 
damage and the result is 3. The goblin is wearing a leather helm which protects for 1 AP, so it 
sustains only 2 points of damage. It has 4 HP in the head and is thus reduced to 2 – there is the 

186.204.39.123

151

sickly stench of burning skin but the damage is not enough to put the goblin down. Alaric has 
also just used two Magic Points for the spell.

Now the goblin can act. Angered by the burst of fire it lashes out with its buckler and lands Alaric 
a critical blow on a roll of 02. Lacking any shield Alaric attempts to parry with his Unarmed 
Combat Skill but rolls 85 – a failure. The goblin has two levels of success now and chooses 
Maximise Damage and Bash Opponent. It inflicts 3 points of damage and hits Alaric in the 
abdomen; the force of the blow, with Bash Opponent, means that Alaric is knocked backwards by 
a metre; Alaric staggers backwards and as his spear is still lodged in the mean goblin, the Games 
Master rules that he has been forced to release his grip on it, unless he wants to spend a CA now 
in making a successful Athletics roll to keep hold. Alaric decides to take the consequences and is 
sent reeling under the force of the blow. The damage is not enough to seriously hurt him since 
he has 6 HP in his abdomen; but he will have a nasty bruise.

It is now Thrace’s turn and he is charging. With a blood curdling scream Thrace runs at the 
goblin,  spear  levelled.  The  goblin  knowing  its  buckler  cannot  stop  all  the  damage  from  a 
longspear, uses his last CA in an attempt to dive clear using its Evade of 35%. Thrace rolls 13 – a 
successful Long Spear check and the goblin rolls 49, failing to avoid the attack. Thrace slams 
into the goblin and gains a Combat Manoeuvre too. He chooses Choose Location, opting for 
the head. Because he is charging, Thrace’s Damage Modifier increases by one step from +1D2 to 
+1D4: his total damage is 6 points for the spear,  3 points for the Damage Modifier and 2 points 
for his Bladesharp spell. The goblin takes 11 points of total damage to its head, its 1AP helmet 
reducing it to 10. Already damaged in the head from Alaric’s spell, this is a Major Wound for the 
goblin and it must make a Resilience roll, opposed by Thrace’s 13 attack, to remain conscious: it 
rolls 55 and expires with the spear rammed into one eye.

All  three  goblin  are  either  dead  or  incapacitated.  Lilina’s  arm  is  bleeding  badly  and  Alaric  is 
standing shieldless and weaponless, sore from the punch to the guts but Thrace’s fast thinking 
and skill with his spear have saved the day. Thrace grins as he cleans his spear tip on the goblin’s 
rags and names his spear ‘Goblin Smiter’ – The Games Master likes the touch and awards Thrace 
a  Hero  Point  for  his  actions.  Alaric  goes  over  to  the  injured  Lilina  and  prepares  to  heal  her 
wounded arm…

magic

Magic is inherent to Legend. Access to it is not restricted by culture or profession and, in many cases, 
magic is a commonplace element used by most people to aid their daily lives. In a high-fantasy setting, 
for example, most Adventurers begin with some common magic, taught to them along with all the 
other mundane skills of their society. In other settings magic may be less common but still apparent: 
it remains, however, as fundamental as the physical laws of the planet or plane of existence.

The Pursuit of Magic

Even though the magical types work very differently and are, to a large extent, mutually exclusive, 
there  is  nothing  to  prevent  Adventurers  from  learning  and  developing  more  than  one  magical 
style. An Adventurer may therefore freely learn Common Magic, dedicate himself to a god to gain 
Divine Magic and even learn a smattering of Sorcery. Sorcerers will more than likely have a good 
understanding of Common Magic but may also pray to their gods to gain a few Divine Spells. 

In reality Adventurers who desire great magical power will choose one form to pursue above 
the others and many societies or cults consider some magical styles to be taboo – but these are 
cultural limitations rather than a limitation of the rules. In reality any Adventurer can pursue any 
magical style and develop several style simultaneously, if they so wish.

Types of Magic

The three magical types are:

Common Magic
Spells  and  cantrips  that  are  ubiquitous  to  many  cultures  and  societies.  Common  Magic 
manipulates  the  natural  order  with  varying  degrees  of  subtlety  and  offers  a  host  of  effects 
that ease daily life or augment specific endeavours, such as combat and skill use. The range of 
Common Magic spells an Adventurer might know may be based on how his culture has shaped 
and prepared its own use of magic, with some spells being more common, or accepted, than 
others. However the nature and effects of Common Magic are visible to all, understood by most 
and recognisable from one culture to another.

Although  the  name  –  Common  Magic  –  denotes  it  as  being  rather  banal,  Common  Magic 
spells can still be very powerful, if used carefully and thoughtfully. Sorcerers, Shaman or Priests 
might sneer at Common Magic’s limitations but only the most foolish of them would ignore or 
denigrate Common Magic’s utility and capabilities.

Divine Magic
Divine Magic stems from the gods. It reflects their natures, ways, spheres of influence, desires, 
needs,  successes,  failures  and  mythic  standing.  Gaining  access  to  Divine  Magic  requires 
a  dedication  of  faith  and  the  willingness  to  enter  into  a  personal  relationship  with  the  deity 

186.204.39.123

153

worshipped. In return for this devotion the worshipper channels aspects of the god’s power and 
abilities. With greater devotion comes greater levels of power: the more the relationship deepens 
the more like the god the worshipper becomes.

Divine Magic is not limited in the same way as Common Magic but it does have certain inherent restrictions 
based on the depth of faith and the strength of the relationship between worshippers and worshipped. 
 
Sorcery
Sorcerers find their power by unlocking the fabric of reality and shaping it through their ability 
to manipulate the rules of creation – moulding it, bending it or breaking it. Sorcery is not based 
on a cultural relationship with magic, or a relationship with a god: it is based on formulae and 
intellect and an overt desire to manipulate reality to suit the caster.

At  its  most  fundamental  level  Sorcery  appears  to  lack  power.  However  through  a  mastery  of 
manipulation, massive levels of power are possible – effects that go far beyond what is here and 
now and visible. The best sorcerers are rightly feared; but to pursue Sorcery to these levels requires 
dedication to its cause and a willingness – or need – to engage in lengthy study and research.

The learning of Sorcery may be taboo amongst some cultures and societies because it breaks the 
tradition of establishing a relationship with a god. This does not make Sorcery evil necessarily but it 
does reinforce the belief that Sorcery is essentially a self-centred activity – an acquirement of personal 
power that obviates the need for, and reliance upon, gods. Sorcery is the key to the universe and 
sorcerers are often driven to seek and attain power that places them on a par with the gods.

Magic Points

All living creatures possess a basic affinity with magic, whether or not they ever become trained in 
it. It is this raw magical power that is nursed and improved by spellcasters over time. This nascent 
magical power fuels spells and other magical or mystical abilities and can also provide protection 
against magical attacks. In Legend, an Adventurer’s magical power is measured by Magic Points. All 
Adventurers start play with Magic Points equal to their POW Characteristic score. An Adventurer’s 
POW score also acts as a maximum limit for the amount of Magic Points an Adventurer can store 
at any one time. However there are certain things that affect available Magic Points:

•	 Certain Magic Items or Spells can raise or lower these limits.
•	

POW dedicated to a god or cult cannot be used for Magic Points, reducing the available 
number for fuelling Common Magic, Sorcery spells or other mystical abilities.

Using Magic Points
Whenever Magic Points are used to power a spell, the total is temporarily reduced by the amount 
used. The Magic Point total cannot fall below zero. Using all one’s Magic Points takes its toll 
on  the  body’s  physical  reserves;  if  an  Adventurer  reaches  zero  Magic  Points  he  must  make  a 
successful Resilience roll to remain conscious. 

If the Resilience roll is successful, he gains a level of Fatigue (see page 88 for more on how Fatigue 
works); if he fails it and falls unconscious, he remains that way for a number of minutes equal to 
his CON subtracted from 21.

Regaining Magic Points
Adventurers automatically regain Magic Points equal to their POW, less any POW dedicated to 
a Pact, every 12 hours. They will regain this amount in six hours if they are fully resting, such as 
sleeping, or through the use of the Meditation Advanced skill (see page 62).

186.204.39.123

common magic

Common Magic is the name given to a variety of spells that are routinely encountered throughout 
many  societies  where  magic  is  used  on  a  daily  basis.  Separate  cultures  may  place  a  different 
emphasis  on  Common  Magic’s  importance  and  have  very  different  spells  in  regular  use;  but 
Common Magic is just what it says: magic that is common to all and encountering it is not 
considered to be out of the ordinary.

Common Magic is taught as part of a culture’s approach to and understanding of magic. Thus, 
in settings where magic is prevalent, a certain set of Common Magic spells will be taught to the 
community as a part of their cultural learning and development. Religious cults and schools of 
sorcery generally offer a certain set of Common Magic spells reflecting their nature. 

Casting Common Magic

The casting of any Common Magic spell requires a successful Common Magic roll. This one 
skill covers casting of any Common Magic spells known. An Adventurer who knows Bladesharp 
and Thunder’s Voice casts both at the same Common Magic value; the two spells do not have 
discrete casting skills.

Whenever a Common Magic spell is cast there is always a sight and sound that nearby creatures 
can detect, be it a flash of light, a crack of thunder or a shimmering in the air. The exact effects 
are up to the Games Master and player to decide for any given spell but will automatically be 
detected by any creatures within 10 metres times the Magnitude of the spell. Example effects are 
included with each spell description.

Alaric’s Tale
Being  part  of  an  barbarian  clan  living  in  the  enchanted  Gloamwood,  Alaric  experiences  magic 
every day. As part of his clan education, and interest in the heavenly wars of the Thunderer, Alaric 
has learned Bladesharp 2, Thunder’s Voice 1, Heal 2 and Vigor 1. He casts all four spells with his 
Common Magic skill of 34% and the number following the spell’s name is the maximum magnitude 
at which Alaric can cast the spell. 

It is likely that, given time, Alaric will learn more Common Magic – either new spells, or by developing 
the Magnitude for existing ones.

Situational Modifiers for Common Magic
Like any skill, Common Magic is subject to circumstances which may inhibit a spell’s chance of 
success. The Common Magic skill modifiers are as follows:

156
186.204.39.123

Casting Modifiers Situational Modifiers
Situation
Spellcaster is gagged or silenced
Spellcaster is restrained 
Spellcaster is prone
Spellcaster is on unstable ground
Partially obscured target
Heavily obscured target
Totally obscured target

Skill Modifier1
Automatic Failure
–30%
–20%
–20%
–20%2
–40%2
Automatic Failure

1 These  modifiers  are  cumulative  –  a  prone  spellcaster  casting  at  a  partially  obscured  target 
decreases his Common Magic skill by –40%.
2 These modifiers only apply if the spell has a target other than the spellcaster, his immediate 
location, his carried possessions or a touched object/individual.

Casting Time
All Common Magic spells take a number of Combat Actions to cast equal to half their Magnitude 
(rounded up). Thus a Bladesharp 3 spell would take 2 CA to cast. More powerful spells take 
longer to cast as the Adventurer seeks to harness the spell’s inherent power.

No offensive Combat Action may be taken while casting a spell, though the Adventurer may 
slowly walk up to half his Movement rate or can act defensively, Parrying or Evading, for instance. 

The Adventurer need not have a hand free to cast a Common Magic spell, with the exception of 
Touch spells, which must be delivered by touching their target.

A spell’s result takes effect at the end of its last casting Combat Action.

Distractions or significant injuries inflicted on a spellcaster as he casts (such as a Serious Wound) 
require unopposed Persistence tests to maintain concentration on the spell. If the spellcaster is 
incapacitated from a Major Wound or by some other effect, blinded for instance, then the spell 
automatically fails.

Magic Point Cost
A Common Magic spell costs a number of Magic Points equal to its Magnitude. So, casting a 
Magnitude 2 spell costs 2 Magic Points. 

Dismissing Spells
As a single Combat Action, a caster can dismiss any spell he has cast. Ceasing to focus on a 
Concentration spell is immediate and not a Combat Action.

Learning Common Magic Spells

In order to learn a spell, an Adventurer must locate a teacher who already knows it and is willing to 
teach it in exchange for money, services or even undertaking a quest to prove themselves worthy. An 
Adventurer with connections to a religious cult or sorcerous order will have an easier time finding 
teachers for more powerful spells. Beginning Adventurers may already have a selection of Common 
Magic spells at the start of their adventuring career, depending on their Cultural Background. 

186.204.39.123

157

Every Common Magic spell is graded by its Magnitude, a score that indicates its relative power. 
Magnitude 1 spells are the weakest and easiest to learn. Learning a new spell takes one day per 
point of Magnitude and costs the equivalent number of Improvement Rolls.

A spell’s Magnitude also defines the intellect required by the individual to absorb, memorise and 
articulate its fabric. The maximum Magnitude of a Common Magic spell any Adventurer can 
learn is equal to his INT divided by three (rounding up). Thus Alaric, with INT 16 can learn any 
Common Magic spell up to a maximum Magnitude of 6. If Alaric wanted to learn the Dragon 
Breath spell, it would cost him two Improvement Rolls and two days of study.

Increasing the Magnitude of a known spell is similar to learning the spell at that Magnitude from 
scratch. Thus, if Alaric wanted to increase from Bladesharp 2 to Bladesharp 3 he would need 
to find a teacher who knows Bladesharp 3 and spend three days in study of the spell. However, 
the number of Improvement Rolls required to learn a higher Magnitude version of a spell, is 
equal to the difference in their Magnitudes, i.e. learning Bladesharp 4, when you already know 
Bladesharp 2, only costs a further two Improvement Rolls. 

Learning a spell at a higher Magnitude means that the Adventurer can still cast the spell at a 
lower Magnitude if he so chooses or needs. Thus Alaric could learn Bladesharp 3 but still cast 
Bladesharp 1 and Bladesharp 2.

Spell Traits and Descriptions

Every Common Magic spell is defined by a series of traits that tells you what kind of spell it is 
and how it is used in the game. A description then follows describing the spell’s precise effects. 
The traits used by spells are detailed here.

Area (X): The spell affects all targets within a radius specified in metres.
 
Concentration: The spell’s effects remain in place as long as the Adventurer concentrates on it. 
Concentrating on a spell is functionally identical to casting the spell, requiring the spellcaster to 
continue to chant and ignore distractions.
 
Duration (X): The spell’s effects will stay in place for the number of minutes indicated.
 
Instant: The spell’s effects take place instantly. The spell itself then disappears.
 

158
186.204.39.123

Magnitude  (X): The  strength  and  power  of  the  spell.  Also  the  minimum  number  of  Magic 
Points required to cast it. If two identical spells are cast on the same target, only the spell with 
the greater Magnitude takes effect – their Magnitudes do not stack.

Progressive: This indicates that the spell can be learnt and cast at greater levels of Magnitude. 
The spell can also be cast at a lower Magnitude if the caster desires.
 
Ranged: Ranged spells may be cast upon targets up to a maximum distance of the Adventurer’s 
POW x 5 in metres.
 
Resist (Evade/Persistence/Resilience): The spell’s effects do not occur automatically. The target 
may make an Opposed Test of their Evade, Persistence or Resilience (as specified by the spell) 
against the casting roll, in order to avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Evade) 
spells require the target to be able to use a Combat Action in order to Evade. 

Touch: Touch spells require the Adventurer to actually touch his target for the spell to take effect. 
The spellcaster must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire casting.
 
Trigger: The spell temporarily lies dormant until an event stated in the description takes place. 
The spell then takes effect and is expended. If the triggering event does not occur within five 
minutes, the spell fades.

Common Magic Spells
Abacus
Instant, Magnitude 1

This spell allows the caster to instantly count the quantity of individual pieces, parts or units 
that one collection of something has. The caster must specify what is being counted: sacks of 
grain on a barn floor, trollish infantry in an army, arrows in a stockpile and so on. This number 
will be exact and unerring but will not account for miscalculations due to poorly defined terms 
for counting.

Armoursmith’s Boon
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to his next Craft Skill Test 
involving any sort of forged metal and cannot stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.

Babel
Duration 5, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

If  this  spell  is  successful,  it  garbles  the  language  of  the  affected  creature. The  target  can  still 
think and, for the most part, act normally but anything it says comes out as gibberish. Thus, a 
commanding officer would be unable to give orders to his men and a spellcaster would be unable 
to cast spells.

186.204.39.123

159

Bandit’s Cloak
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to his next Stealth Skill Test 
involving any sort of hiding or lurking and cannot stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.

Bearing Witness
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to his next Skill Test made 
to discover lies, secrets or hidden objects and cannot stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.

Beast Call
Instant, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

The Beast Call serves to attract an animal within range. When the spell is cast, it affects a targeted 
creature with a fixed INT of 7 or less. If it fails to resist, the creature will be naturally drawn to the 
place where the spell is cast, whereupon the spell effect terminates. Any barrier, immediate threat or 
counter control also ends the effects of the spell, leaving the creature to react naturally. For example, 
the Beast Call spell might cause a horse to turn and walk towards the spell but a single yank of 
its reins by the rider would end the spell’s effect. This spell is a potent aid to hunters and herders. 

Bestial Enhancement
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

This  spell  causes  the  creature  to  become  more  bestial,  augmenting  its  natural  weapons  and 
reflexes. For every point of Magnitude, it increases the target’s chance to hit with natural weapons 
by +5% and they deal one point of extra damage. This extra damage is magical and will affect 
creatures that can only be hurt by magic. The base natural weapon damage remains non-magical.

Becalm
Instant, Magnitude 1, Touch

This spell gives the target the ability to sleep for exactly 10 hours uninterrupted by bad dreams, 
pains, aches or even gentle movement. Unless stirred by a loud noise or abrupt physical contact, 
the target will have a full night’s rest. It should be noted that the spell does not put the target to 
sleep, merely calms their mind in order to better enjoy their next slumber. This spell is useful to 
spellcasters who wish to fully regain their Magic Points.

Befuddle
Duration 5, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

If successful, this spell confuses an opponent to the extent that it may forget who it is or who its 
friends are. The affected target may not cast spells and may only take non-offensive actions. The 
target may run if it so chooses or Evade and Parry normally in combat, though it may not make 
any attacks unless it is attacked first.

Spirits and non-corporeal creatures are not affected by this spell.

This spell can be cast on any weapon capable of cutting and/or thrusting. For every point of 
Magnitude, it increases the attack chance with the weapon by +5% and deals one point of extra 
damage. This extra damage is magical and affects creatures that can only be hurt by magic. The 
weapon’s base damage remains non-magical. A weapon under the effects of Bladesharp cannot 
benefit from other damage enhancing spells such as Pierce or Fireblade.

Bludgeon
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

This spell can be cast on any crushing or smashing weapon, such as a warhammer, club or mace. 
For every point of Magnitude, it increases the attack chance with the weapon by +5% and deals 
one point of extra damage. This extra damage is magical and will affect creatures that can only 
be hurt by magic. The weapon’s base damage remains non-magical.

Boon of Lasting Night
Area Special, Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

If successful, the spell turns the area of effect into a sphere of darkness equal to a moonless night. 
All non-magical light (including sunlight) passing or present within the boundary is reduced to 
the equivalent of a candle. This radius of the area is equal to the Magnitude of the spell.

Cauterise
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to his next First Aid or Healing 
Skill Test made to mend open wounds and cannot stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.

Chill
Instant, Magnitude 1, Touch

This spell allows the caster to drastically lower the temperature of any mundane object. With this ability he can 
speed up the cooling of metal in a forge, make pub drinks cold for his companions, along with several other 
interesting tricks. It is up to the Games Master to decide the exact effects this would have in a given situation.

Clear Path
Duration 5, Magnitude 1

This spell allows the caster to move through even the most tangled, thorny brush as if he were 
on an open road.

Co-ordination
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the caster’s DEX score increases by two. This may 
have an additional effect on his skills and Attributes, such as Combat Actions and Strike Rank. 
The caster cannot increase his DEX in this way to more than twice its original value.

186.204.39.123

161

Countermagic
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

Countermagic is used to dismiss another spell within range. The targeted spell is nullified if the 
Magnitude of the Countermagic equals or exceeds its own. Countermagic can be cast reactively 
to neutralise offensive spells, by using the Cast Spell Combat Action.

Exploring  an  ancient  tomb,  Lilina  encounters  her  dreaded  enemy,  Rhazil  the  Vivisectionist. 
On his first Combat Action Rhazil casts a Befuddle spell. Lilina immediately declares that she 
is  using  the  Cast  Spell  Combat  Action  to  defend  herself.  She  casts  Countermagic  2,  which 
fortunately dismisses Rhazil’s spell before it can hit her.

Countermagic Shield
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This spell actively disrupts offensive spells aimed at the caster or his equipment. Countermagic 
Shield will attempt to block the effects of any spells cast toward it. It will not have any effect on 
spells that are already affecting an Adventurer. The effects of Countermagic Shield depend on the 
relative Magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell.

Darkwall
Area Special, Duration 5, Magnitude 2, Ranged

By casting this spell, the Adventurer creates a patch of pitch blackness that fills the target area. 
Light sources within this area shed no illumination and normal sight ceases to function. Other 
senses such as a bat’s sonar function normally. The radius of the area is equal to the Magnitude 
of the spell.

Demoralise
Duration 5, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

The target of this spell will become demoralised, losing all hope of victory and losing faith 
in its own abilities. When attacking, the target’s weapon skills are halved (before modifiers) 
and  it  may  not  cast  offensive  spells.  However,  the  target  continues  to  defend  at  its  full 
skill.  If  this  spell  takes  effect  before  combat  begins,  the  target  will  try  to  avoid  fighting 
and will either run or surrender. The effects of this spell are automatically cancelled by the 
Fanaticism spell and vice versa.

186.204.39.123

Detect X
Concentration, Magnitude 1, Ranged, Resist (Special)

Detect is several spells, which allow the caster to locate the targets of the spell within its range. 
This  effect  is  stopped  by  dense  or  thick  materials  such  as  metal,  or  earth  and  stone  at  least 
one metre thick. It is also blocked by Countermagic Shield (or equivalent spells) of a greater 
Magnitude. The separate Detect spells are listed here.

Detect Enemy: Gives the location of creatures who intend to harm the caster. Targets attempting 
to keep their motivations hidden may resist with Persistence.

Detect Magic: Gives the location of enchanted items, magical creatures or active spells.

Detect Species: Each unique Detect Species spell will give the location of members of the specified 
species. Examples of this spell include Detect Duck, Detect Rhino or Detect Trollkin.

Detect Substance: Each unique Detect Substance spell will give the location of substances of the 
specified type. Examples of this spell include Detect Coal, Detect Gold or Detect Wood.

The Games Master should provide the rough power of the detected subject (‘weak magic’ or ‘rich 
gold lode’) and require further Common Magic tests for more detailed information.

Disruption
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

A particularly grisly offensive spell, Disruption literally pulls a target’s body apart. For each point 
of Magnitude the target suffers 1D3 points of damage to a random Hit Location, ignoring any 
Armour Points.

Dragon’s Breath
Instant, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Evade)

With this spell, the caster spits a stream of fire at his target. If the fire is not evaded, it inflicts 
1D10  points  of  heat  damage  to  a  random  location.  Armour  Points  are  effective  against  this 
damage and it counts as both magical and fire damage.

Dullblade
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

This spell can be cast on any weapon but will not affect unarmed attacks or natural weaponry. 
For every point of Magnitude, it reduces the damage dealt by the targeted weapon by two.

Endurance
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

For every point of Magnitude, this spell restores one level of Fatigue that the target is currently 
suffering from.

164
186.204.39.123

Entertainer’s Smile
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to the target’s next Dance, 
Sing or Play Instrument Skill Test involving the observations and appreciation of others and 
cannot stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.

Extinguish
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

This spell instantly puts out fires. At Magnitude 1, it can extinguish a Flame, Magnitude 2 a 
Small Fire, Magnitude 3 a Large Fire and Magnitude 4 will put out an Inferno (see page 83 for 
sizes of fire).

Fanaticism
Duration 5, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

The target of this spell becomes fanatical, believing he can defeat any foe and overcome any 
obstacle. His attacks with Close Combat Weapon skills are increased by half but he may not 
attempt to evade, parry or cast spells. The effects of this spell are automatically cancelled by the 
Demoralise spell and vice versa. Willing targets of Fanaticism may surrender to the spell without 
resisting it.

Fate
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch, Resist (Persistence)

This spell allows the caster to influence fate, either for the good or ill of the target. The caster can 
increase or decrease the target’s next Skill Test by 10% for each point of the spell’s Magnitude. 
The caster must choose at the time of the casting whether to increase or decrease the target’s 
chances – allowing him to give his friends an advantage or hobble his enemies. Only the next 
Skill Test made after (resisting) the spell’s casting is affected.

Firearrow
Instant 1, Magnitude 1, Touch, Trigger

Casting this spell on a missile weapon (such as an arrow, bolt, rock or dart) will cause it to burst 
into flame when it is fired or thrown. When it hits a target, the missile will deal an extra 1D6 
points of magical fire atop its normal damage. A missile under the effects of Firearrow cannot 
benefit from Multimissile or Speedart.

Fireblade
Duration 5, Magnitude 3, Touch

By touching a cutting or impaling weapon, the caster causes its blade to burst into flame. For the 
duration of the spell, this weapon will deal an extra 1D6 points of magical fire damage atop of 
its normal damage. A weapon under the effects of Fireblade cannot benefit from other damage 
enhancing spells such as Bladesharp or Pierce.

186.204.39.123

165

Frostbite
Instant, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

This attack spell allows the caster to freeze his opponent, dealing 1d3 points of damage (rolled 
once) to all Hit Locations, ignoring any Armour Points. Magical effects that protect against cold 
damage can block this effect but mundane items (such as cold weather gear) are ineffective.

Glamour
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the caster’s CHA score increases by +2. This may have 
an additional effect on his skills. The caster cannot increase his CHA in this way to more than 
twice its original value.

Golden Tongue
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

The  caster  gains  a  bonus  to  any  Commerce,  Evaluate  or  Influence  test  equal  to  +5%  x  the 
Magnitude of the spell. This bonus only applies when an Adventurer is evaluating, buying or 
selling goods or equipment.

Hand of Death
Instant, Magnitude 4, Resist (Resilience), Touch, Trigger

This fearsome spell allows the caster to deal an awful wound with the merest touch. Casting the 
Hand of Death, charges his body with the spell. Touching an unsuspecting target, or succeeding 
at an Unarmed attack against a wary target, releases the spell’s effect. If the Resilience test to 
resist the effect is failed, the Hit Location touched immediately suffers enough damage to cause 
a Major Wound. If the Resilience test is a success, the target only loses 1d3 Hit Points. Armour 
does not protect against this damage.

Heal
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the caster can repair one Hit Point of damage to an 
injured Hit Location. Casting this spell on creatures of a different species will have half the Hit 
Points restored.

This spell cannot re-attach a severed limb, or heal a maimed one. Such wounds require stronger 
magic.

Ignite
Instant, Magnitude 1, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

Ignite  sets  fire  to  anything  flammable  within  range,  creating  a  Flame  (see  page  88).  Living 
creatures cannot be ignited and if the target is worn or held by a living being (such as clothing) 
then the wearer/wielder may resist.

166
186.204.39.123

Light
Area Special, Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Ranged

When cast on an inanimate object, this spell produces a steady radiance which extends one metre 
per point of Magnitude. The area is considered to be illuminated. Note that only the specified 
area is illuminated – everything outside the area of effect is not.

Lucky
Instant, Magnitude 2, Trigger

This spell allows the caster to re-roll his next failed Skill Test but cannot be used to re-roll a 
fumble. Whatever the result of the second roll may be, the caster must accept it. A caster can only 
benefit from one casting of Lucky at a time.

Mason’s Boon
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Trigger

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of Magnitude to his next Craft Skill Test 
involving any form of natural earth, stone or sand and cannot stack with any other spell-effect 
bonuses.

Mindspeech
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

This spell affects one target for every point of Magnitude. It allows telepathy between the caster 
and any target, though targets will not have telepathy with one another. The words transmitted 
by telepathy must be whispered and will be heard directly in the head of the recipient, in the 
same language in which it was spoken.

Mobility
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the target’s Movement score is increased by one metre.

Multimissile
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch, Trigger

Cast on a missile weapon (such as a knife, arrow, javelin or rock), this spell is triggered when 
it  is  fired  or  thrown.  Multimissile  creates  one  additional  magical  missile  for  every  point  of 
Magnitude. Each magical missile’s attack is rolled for separately and compared against the target’s 
single Evade or (shield) Parry roll. They use the same dice of damage as the original but will not 
benefit from the firer’s Damage Modifier. The additional missiles created through Multimissile 
will affect creatures that can only be hurt by magic. A missile under the effects of Multimissile 
cannot benefit from Firearrow, Pierce or Speedart.

186.204.39.123

167

Parry
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

Parry improves the caster’s defences whilst parrying with the targeted weapon or shield. Each 
point of Magnitude increases his parry chance by +5% and the Armour Points of the weapon 
by 1.

Pierce
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

This spell can be cast on any weapon with a blade or point. For every point of Magnitude, it 
ignores two Armour Points when it strikes an armoured location, including magical Armour 
Points. A weapon under the effects of Pierce cannot benefit from other damage enhancing spells 
such as Bladesharp or Fireblade.

Protection
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, one Armour Point is added to every Hit Location of 
the caster. This stacks with any existing armour and is treated in the same manner.

Push/Pull
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

This spell allows the caster to move an item of up to 1 SIZ or ENC per point of Magnitude either 
towards or away from the caster in a straight line, as if pushed suddenly from one direction or the 
other. The item is not moved with significant enough force to inflict damage unless it is naturally 
damaging (a bottle of acid, for instance) and the caster has no control over the distance pushed 
or pulled; as this depends on the location of the item or the surface it rests on. Living creatures 
targeted by this spell are allowed a Resilience roll to resist.

Repair
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

Every point of Magnitude of this spell repairs one Hit Point of damage to a non-living target. The 
marks of repair remain visible, probably reducing the target’s market value, unless an appropriate 
Craft test is made at the time of casting.

Second Sight
Duration 5, Magnitude 3, Ranged

Second Sight allows the caster to gauge the POW aura of every creature and magic item within 
range, which is not blocked from his vision. The caster will know if each aura is less than his own 
POW, within three points of his own POW or greater than his own POW.

Second Sight also reveals invisible entities, such as spirits or ethereal undead, though only a hazy 
image will show (treat such targets as partially obscured).

168
186.204.39.123

Skybolt
Instant, Magnitude 3, Ranged, Resist (Evade)

The caster summons a lightning bolt from the heavens regardless of the weather. The target must 
be outdoors in plain view. Skybolt inflicts 2D6 points of damage to a single chosen location. 
Only magical Armour Points offer protection against this damage.

Slow
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the target’s Movement score will be decreased by one 
metre. A target’s Movement may not be reduced to below one through use of this spell.

Speedart
Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch, Trigger

Cast on a missile weapon (such as a knife, arrow, javelin or rock), this spell is triggered when it 
is fired or thrown. Attempts to parry or evade the missile suffer a –5% penalty per Magnitude 
of the spell and damage is increased by one point per Magnitude. A missile under the effects of 
Speedart cannot benefit from Firearrow, Multimissile or Pierce.

Spirit Bane
Area Special, Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Resist (Persistence)

This spell creates a zone with a radius of one metre per point of Magnitude, which spirits find 
exceptionally hard to enter. Any spirit with a POW less than the caster’s attempting to enter the 
protected area must resist the spell in order to do so. Spirits within the zone at the time of its 
creation must resist it or be compelled to leave as quickly as possible.

Strength
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the caster’s STR score increases by +2. This may have 
an additional effect on his skills and Attributes, such as Damage Modifier. The caster cannot 
increase his STR in this way to more than twice its original value.

Thunder’s Voice
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This spell grants the caster a thunderous voice of command. For every point of Magnitude of this 
spell, the caster has +10% added to his Influence skill and can also be heard at up to the spell’s 
Magnitude x 100 in metres.

186.204.39.123

169

Understanding
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This  spell  grants  the  caster  a  +5%  per  point  of  Magnitude  bonus  to  any  Language  skill  he 
currently knows.

Vigour
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

For every point of Magnitude of this spell, the caster’s CON score increases by +2. This may have 
an additional effect on his skills and Attributes. The caster cannot increase his CON in this way 
to more than twice its original value.

Warmth
Duration 5, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This spell keeps the caster warm and comfortable in a bitter cold environment. He suffers no 
penalties to Fatigue tests from a cold environment while this spell is functioning. Warmth also 
protects  the  caster  from  one  point  of  cold  damage  (magical  or  mundane)  for  every  point  of 
Magnitude.

Water Breath
Duration 5, Magnitude 2, 

This spell allows the caster to breathe water for the duration of the effect. Water Breath has no 
effect on the target’s ability to breathe air.

divine magic

Whereas Common Magic is available directly to Adventurers, Divine Magic is not. Divine Magic 
is gifted by the gods and is usually available only through membership of a cult – and even then, 
only to cult members who have attained an appropriate level of standing within the cult. Lay 
members of a cult – those who follow the cult’s precepts and generally adhere to the faith but 
make no formal commitment to it – have no access to Divine Magic. Initiates and above – those 
who have opted to serve the cult and their god directly – do have access to Divine Magic and 
Divine spells are often a significant enough lure to secure this depth of commitment.

How Divine Magic Works

Divine Magic has a number of essential Characteristics separating it from other types of magic:

Spells offered reflect the god. –Unlike other forms of magic, where the Adventurer may seek out 
any spells he wishes, Divine Magic is inextricably linked to the god it springs from. No matter 
how great her faith, a priestess of the Moon Queen will never be able to hurl a blast of fire, as her 
divine patron has no authority over fire.

Divine spells are significantly more powerful than Common Magic spells in that no Magic Points 
are needed to cast them; instead they are channelled directly from the god. However, the amount 
and strength of Divine Magic any Adventurer can use is dependent on how deep a relationship 
that Adventurer has cultivated with his god, through the dedication of POW and increasing the 
pact with the deity.

Divine Magic relies on two skills: the Pact skill, which reflects the strength and depth of the 
divine relationship and is used to both gain and regain spells; and Lore (Specific Theology) to 
cast the spell.

Pact (CHA+Dedicated POW)
Essentially a Pact is a commitment to serve a god through devoting one’s soul through worship. 
The making of a Pact is represented by dedicating one or more points of POW to the god. The 
Adventurer still possesses the POW for calculating skills but it is the god that harvests the Magic 
Points from the dedicated POW.

Making a Pact is simple: the Adventurer, at the point of cult initiation, declares how many points of 
POW he intends to dedicate to the Pact. He must dedicate a minimum of one point and a maximum 
of one quarter of his available POW. The dedicated POW then forms the basis of his Pact Skill.

An Adventurer may be initiated into more than one cult and thus have several concurrent Pact 
skills.

186.204.39.123

171

The Magic Points available to the Adventurer are limited to the amount of his undedicated POW. 
Thus, an Adventurer with a POW of 12 dedicating 7 points to his cult would have only 5 Magic 
Points available for use elsewhere. Once a point of POW has been dedicated to a cult, it cannot 
be used for any other Pacts, until membership of that cult is renounced. Thus, a follower of the 
Thunder God with a POW of 10 might dedicate six points to the Thunderer cult but this would 
leave only a further four points to be dedicated to another cult. Leaving a cult reduces the related 
Pact skill to zero and prevents him from using any Divine Magic from that god – but releases the 
POW previously dedicated to that Pact.

Dedicated POW forms the basis of a ‘pool’ of points used to power Divine Magic spells. For 
example, a priest with 4 POW dedicated to his god has 4 POW to invest in Divine spells.

The starting value of the Pact skill is equal to CHA + Dedicated POW. Like any other skill it can 
be developed through the spending of Improvement rolls, improving the CHA characteristic, 
or dedicating further POW. Pact can also be increased in other ways, as the Pact Improvement 
table, following, demonstrates. The higher the Pact skill, the more dedicated the follower. It is 
not a measure of how much an Adventurer knows about the cult or god; that is still measured by 
the Lore (Specific Theology) skill.

Multiple Pacts
Adventurers may join more than one cult, thereby establishing more than one Pact with a deity 
– as long as the different cults are compatible (being allied in some way or a sub-cult of a larger 
organisation). The only restriction on having multiple cult membership is the amount of POW 
the Adventurer is willing or able to devote to each Pact: a Pact always requires a dedication of at 
least one POW.

cult. .

Pact Improvement

1D6
1D4+1
1D2

1 per point of POW dedicated
1 point per instance

These improvements are in addition to any Improvement rolls an Adventurer wants to use for 
developing the relationship with his god.

As  the  Pact  increases,  so  does  the  propensity  to  act  in  the  way  or  ways  the  god  or  focus  of 
veneration acts. The higher the Pact, the more like the god, or object of veneration, the character 
becomes. Thus his character, judgements, deeds and actions reflect those of his god, because the 
character is essentially becoming more and more like his god. This kind of behaviour requires 
roleplaying  for  its  effectiveness  and  Games  Masters  should  watch  for  situations  where  the 
strength of the Pact will assert itself in an Adventurer’s actions. Adventurers can, as their Pact 
increases, undergo complete personality changes as a result, although the circumstances where 
this happens are judgement calls for the Games Master.

172
186.204.39.123

Quests
Gods demand service from their followers, in the form of quests. The nature and scope of the 
quest varies from deity to deity. A servant of the Thunderer, for example, might be sent to slay a 
terrible frost-worm that dwells atop a distant mountain. Those who worship the Green might be 
charged with bringing water to the desert lands, so they bloom with new life. Most quests involve 
furthering the god’s aims, protecting other worshippers, gathering new followers, or thwarting 
enemies. Not every quest involves travel or adventure; the god of knowledge might demand that 
a petitioner solve an ancient riddle or obtain a copy of a lost book of secret wisdom. 

Many cults have rituals or myth-cycles that must be enacted again and again as lesser quests. For 
example, to advance in the cult of the Thunderer, Alaric must enter the underground pits in the 
Vale of Storms and fight his way past the snake-men who dwell there until he finds the Great 
Green Gong and sounds it. Completing this lesser quest increases his Pact score by 1D4+1%. 
Every aspiring follower of the Thunderer in Alaric’s tribe undertakes this quest.

By contrast, every great quest is unique and extremely perilous. Great quests do not re-enact tired 
old ancient myths – they forge brave new legends!

Limits to Dedicated POW
The amount of POW that can be dedicated to any particular Pact is dependent on the rank 
and the cult itself. Some cults will have a minimum dedication but all cults have a maximum 
dedication, based on the rank. The Cults section of this chapter provides more detail on the 
different ranks.

Lay Member (Level 0) – No Dedicated POW
Initiate (Level 1) – ¼ of POW
Acolyte (Level 2) – ½  of POW
Priest (Level 3) – ¾ of POW
High Priest (Level 4) – All POW

Lore (Specific Theology) (INT x2)
A specific theology skill is associated with every god. Thus Lore (The Thunderer) exists discretely 
from Lore (Moon Goddess). The skill is used in two ways: first as a measure of the knowledge the 
Adventurer has of the god’s myths, aspects, behaviour and so forth and of the rituals, ceremonies 
and practices associated with the god’s cult. Secondly Lore (Specific Theology) is used as the skill 
roll for casting any Divine Spells associated with the god successfully. So, an Adventurer with 
Lore (The Thunderer) 60% has a 60% chance to cast any of the Divine Spells he has gained from 
his worship of the Thunder God.

If a deity is part of a wider pantheon then the Adventurer understands the Lore of gods associated 
with the pantheon at half his Lore (Specific Theology) value but he cannot use this to cast Divine 
Spells. Pantheistic cults do, frequently, teach the spells from one member god to cult members 
of an allied cult and where this is permissible then the Adventurer uses his full Lore (Specific 
Theology) for spell casting.

Casting Divine Magic
Divine  Magic  spells  are  prayed  for  by  the  worshipper  before  they  can  be  called  upon.  Each 
Divine spell takes up a single point of Dedicated POW to store. However, Divine Spells do not 
cost any Magic Points when cast, as the caster is channelling the power of their god and is not 
fuelling the spell through his own, personal, magical reserves. 

186.204.39.123

173

Alaric’s Tale
Alaric has become an Initiate of the Thunderer, a cult strongly represented in his own community. 

In becoming an Initiate Alaric has dedicated 4 POW to the Pact, giving him a Pact (The Thunderer) 
14%. His POW, for the purposes of available Magic Points, is lowered from 14 to 10 but it also means 
that Alaric has four points that can be dedicated towards the Thunder God’s Divine Magic.

Alaric also has Lore (The Thunderer) 52%. The skill means that any Divine Magic spells Alaric gains 
as an initiate of the cult are cast at 52%. It also means that Alaric knows the lore of the associated 
cult, the Runefather, at 26% because the Thunderer and the Runefather are father and son in the 
same pantheon. However Alaric cannot cast any Runefather Divine spells unless they are taught to 
him as part of allied cult rituals. If he gains any allied cult spells then they will operate at 52%, his 
Lore (The Thunderer percentage.

So at this point in his life Alaric’s understanding of the Thunderer is reasonably strong as he has spent 
most of his life exposed to its rituals and practices. However his direct relationship with the Thunderer, 
represented by his Pact, is still very weak. Alaric has only just embarked on the road of devotion to his 
god and will need to strengthen and deepen his Pact over time.

As a measure of the faith of the worshipper, when a Divine spell is cast it possesses an inherent 
Magnitude of one tenth of the caster’s Pact skill. Priests and High Priests are able to channel so 
much of their god’s power that their spells are exceptionally hard to block or dismiss.

The same Divine Spell can be learned multiple times.

To cast the spell the Adventurer must successfully roll against his Lore (Specific Theology). Note 
the result of the roll.

Critical Success: The spell is cast and may be cast again. It is not placed beyond use.

Success: The spell is cast successfully and is then placed beyond use until the Adventurer can 
regain it as per his rank in the cult (see the Regaining Divine Spells).

Failure: The spell does not work but the Adventurer can attempt to cast it again later.

Fumble: The spell does not work and is also placed beyond use until the Adventurer can regain 
it as per his rank in the cult (see the Regaining Divine Spells).

When a spell is placed beyond use it is not forgotten; it is merely the case that the Adventurer 
cannot channel his god’s power via that spell again, until he has successfully regained the god’s 
ongoing trust in their relationship.

Regaining Divine Spells
Depending on their rank within the cult, a spell can be regained upon a successful Pact test, 
showing that the Adventurer has re-established their faith with the god and is able to channel 
that god’s power once more through the Divine spell.

186.204.39.123

Alaric’s Tale
As  a Thunderer  initiate,  Alaric  learns  Lightning  Strike,  Blessing  (Spear  and  Shield),  Shield  and 
Channel Strength. This takes all of his 4 points of Dedicated POW to store. The spells are cast at 
Alaric’s Lore (the Thunderer) of 52%. His Pact (the Thunderer) of 14% governs the Magnitude of all 
the Divine Spells he can cast: at a tenth of his Pact, rounded up, each of his four Divine Spells can be 
cast at Magnitude 2 (14/10 = 1.4, rounded to 2).

During an adventure Alaric successfully casts Shield. As the spell was a standard success he cannot use 
it again until he has returned to a shrine of the Thunderer and succeeded in a Pact roll of 16% or less.

Later in the same adventure Alaric critically succeeds in casting Channel Strength. This means he can 
use Channel Strength again without having to attempt a Pact roll to re-establish his relationship with 
the Thunderer. He is forced to cast Channel Strength once more but this time fumbles in the attempt; 
not only does the spell fail to work but this level of failure places the spell beyond Alaric’s use until he 
can return to a shrine and attempt a Pact roll to recover it.

Lay Members – No access to Divine spells.
Initiates – May test to regain a Divine spell the day after it was used but must return to a shrine 
or temple to pray for the spell. It requires a successful Pact test to recover; failure requires that 
they try again the following day.
Acolytes – May test to regain a Divine spell the day after it was used; however, if the test fails 
they must return to a shrine or temple and recover the spell there.

Priests – Lords –May test to regain a Divine spell an hour after it was used; however, if 
the test fails they must return to a shrine or temple and recover the spell there.

•	

High Priests – May test to regain Divine spells an hour after they have been used; failing the 
roll simply incurs a delay of another hour before they can try again, whereas a fumble means the 
spell must be recovered at a temple. 

Dismissing Divine Magic Spells
Like  Common  Magic,  a  caster  can  dismiss  any  Divine  Magic  spell(s)  he  has  cast  as  a  single 
Combat Action. Ceasing to maintain a Concentration spell is immediate and not a Combat 
Action.

An  Adventurer  may  also  willingly  release  a  Divine  Magic  spell  from  their  Dedicated  POW. 
This immediately frees the spell from their psyche, harmlessly dissipating the divine link and 
liberating the point of Dedicated POW to store a different spell if desired.

Acquiring Divine Magic
Learning Divine Magic requires a sacrifice of time and effort. To acquire a new Divine Magic 
spell, the Adventurer must possess the Lore (Specific Theology) skill appropriate to the religion 
from which the spell is requested and be of sufficient rank within the cult.

The Minimum Cult Rank denotes the rank the Adventurer must be within the cult to be granted 
access to that spell. The most powerful Divine Magic is withheld for those who have proven their 
faith and prowess.

The Minimum Temple Requirement represents the fact that the character must be at a sufficiently 
holy site in order for the god in question to grant the spell to the Adventurer. Such temples 
will  also  have  experienced  Acolytes  or    Priests  that  can  aid  the  Adventurer  in  their  religious 
supplications. Once learned, the Adventurer must return to a temple of similar status in order 
to regain the spell.

The Cost of the spell is how many Improvement Rolls it takes to learn a new Divine spell. Once 
taught, there is no further cost to regain the spell by prayer.

Depending  on  the  setting,  cults  rarely  charge  a  monetary  cost  for  learning  Divine  Magic, 
although they sometimes set tests for worshippers to prove themselves worthy of being granted 
such spells. This is for the simple reason that anyone learning Divine Magic from a cult is already 
an active member and it benefits the cult to make active members more powerful.

Divine Magic Spell Traits and Descriptions

Every Divine Magic spell is defined by a series of traits describing the spell and how it is used 
in  the  game.  A  description  then  follows  describing  the  spell’s  precise  effects.  By  default,  the 
Magnitude of any Divine spell is equal to one tenth of the caster’s Pact. Unless specifically stated 
in its description, Divine Spells take one Combat Action to invoke. The other traits used by 
Divine Magic spells are detailed here.

Area (X): The spell affects all targets within a radius specified in metres.

Concentration: The spell’s effects remain in place as long as the Adventurer concentrates on it. 
Concentrating on a spell is functionally identical to casting the spell, requiring the spellcaster to 
continue to gesture with both arms, chant and ignore distractions. 

Duration (X): The spell’s effects stay in place for the number of minutes indicated.

Instant: The spell’s effects take place instantly. The spell then disappears.

Ranged: Ranged spells may be cast upon targets up to a maximum distance of the Adventurer’s 
POW x 10 in metres.

Rank: The minimum cult rank the spell is available to. 

176
186.204.39.123

Resist (Evade/Persistence/Resilience): The spell’s effects do not occur automatically. The target 
may make an Opposed Evade, Persistence or Resilience test (as specified by the spell) in order to 
avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Evade) spells require the target to be able 
to use a Combat Action in order to dodge.

Touch: Touch spells require the character to actually touch his target for the spell to take effect. 
The spellcaster must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire casting.

Absorption
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This  spell  absorbs  incoming  spells  aimed  at  the  target  or  his  equipment,  converting  their 
magical energy into Magic Points which are then available to the target. Once cast on a subject, 
Absorption will attempt to absorb the effects of any spells cast at the target. It will not have any 
effect on spells that are already affecting an Adventurer. The effects of Absorption depend on the 
relative Magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell – see the Absorption Results table for 
more details. Any spell absorbed by this spell is cancelled and has no effect.

Absorption Results
Incoming Spell’s Magnitude is. . .
Equal to or weaker than Absorption’s 
Magnitude.
1 or more points stronger than 
Absorption’s Magnitude.

Effect
Incoming spell absorbed and Absorption remains.

Absorption eliminated and incoming spell takes 
effect.

An  Adventurer  may  not  accumulate  more  Magic  Points  than  his  undedicated  POW  while 
Absorption  is  in  effect  –  excess  Magic  Points  garnered  through  Absorption  simply  vanish. 
Absorption is incompatible with Reflection, Shield and Spirit Block.

Alter Target
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Ranged

The caster of this spell has the ability to re-direct ranged attacks away from their intended target. 
Each missile attack or spell of lesser Magnitude requires a Combat Action to deflect, turning it 
away from its original target and towards another victim of the caster’s choice. This new recipient 
has to be a viable target for the source of the attack and cannot be the original source of the attack.

Amplify
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

The caster requests that his god boosts the magical abilities of the recipient. While the spell is in 
effect all castings of Common Magic with the Progressive trait have their Magnitude boosted by 
the Magnitude of this spell. No Common Magic spell can have its Magnitude boosted beyond 
10. This increase in Magnitude does not cost the recipient any more Magic Points than normal.

For  example,  Thrace  casts  a  Magnitude  3  Bladesharp,  spending  the  required  3  Magic  Points 
and makes the Common Magic Skill Test. Since he is currently under the effects of a Magnitude 

186.204.39.123

177

5 Amplify cast by Lilina a few minutes before, the Bladesharp counts as having been cast with 
Magnitude 8 for all purposes.

Aphrodisiac
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell increases the target’s sexual attraction. Any failed Influence or Streetwise rolls toward 
members  of  the  opposite  sex  (or  those  of  the  same  sex  that  would  find  the  target  sexually 
attractive), are treated as successes instead. Fumbles, normal successes and criticals are unaffected. 
Aphrodisiac makes all opposite-sex individuals around the target friendlier and more focussed 
upon them – which could be a very good or very bad thing depending on the circumstances.

Beast Form
Duration 15, Rank Acolyte, Touch

This spell transforms the caster and all his personal belongings into an animal that is sacred to 
his cult or faith. The caster retains his INT, CHA and POW scores but exchanges his STR, DEX, 
CON and SIZ scores for average values of the animal shape and gains a bonus to each physical 
Characteristic of +1 per point of Magnitude. He also gains the natural abilities of the creature. 
The animal cannot be mystical or magical in any way and the Games Master should have the 
final say as to what manner of creature would fit a specific cult if it is not obvious.

Behold
Duration 15, Rank Initiate

The  caster  sees  what  another  cult  member  of  equal  or  lesser  rank  is  currently  experiencing. 
The image is from the point of view of the cult member being beheld, so there could be some 
confusion as to what is happening in certain circumstances (member is sleeping, blindfolded and 
so on). This spell does not convey sound, only image and if the member is dead or magically 
protected against scrying by a spell of greater Magnitude the caster will be rendered effectively 
blind for the duration.

Berserk
Duration 15, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Persistence), Touch

The recipient of this spell is overcome with bloodlust, causing him to disregard his own safety 
and loyalties but imbuing him with tremendous stamina and combat ability.

For the spell’s duration the Close Combat skills of the recipient are increased by half again, his 
Damage Modifier increased by one step and he automatically succeeds any opposed or unopposed 
Resilience  or  Fatigue  test...  although a Major wound will still incapacitate him. However, in 
return the subject may not Parry, Evade or cast any magic while under the influence of Berserk. 

Unwilling  targets  receive  a  chance  to  resist.  Normally,  the  recipient  remains  in  the  Berserk 
state for the entire duration of the spell but Games Masters may allow a Berserk Adventurer to 
shake off the effects with an unopposed Persistence test. At the end of the spell, the recipient 
immediately drops two Fatigue levels. Berserk may not be combined with Fanaticism – Berserk 
will always take precedence in such cases.

178
186.204.39.123

Bless Crops
Duration Special, Rank Priest, Touch

Cast  on  cultivated  farmland  Bless  Crops  affects  a  number  of  square  kilometres  equal  to  the 
Magnitude of the spell. It guarantees a harvest if maintained for a year irrespective of weather or 
other conditions. This spell cannot be recovered or released, for as long as the spell is maintained.

Blessing
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell grants a bonus to a cult skill. The target receives a bonus of +5% per Magnitude of 
the spell. The specific skill is determined by the caster but must be one of the cult’s skills. For 
instance, an Earth Cult might grant a bonus to Craft (Masonry) but a War Cult could grant the 
bonus to all Weapon Skills. This bonus cannot be stacked with any other spell-effect bonuses.

Breathe Water
Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Touch

Breath Water allows an air-breathing creature to breathe water (the subject will still be able to 
breathe air as well), for up to one hour per point of Magnitude. This spell cannot be recovered 
or released, until the spell ends.

Call Winds
Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

Allows the caster to summon or bend the winds to his will, in an area whose diameter is equal to 
the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres. The maximum strength of winds the caster can control 
or invoke depends on their Cult Rank. Acolytes can summon up to Moderate Winds, Priests 
up to Gales and High Priests up to Hurricanes (see Wind Strength page 232). If the caster can 
control the wind he may reduce it to Calm or change its direction if desired. This spell cannot 
alter magically-created weather effects of greater Magnitude.

Channel Strength
Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Touch

Through this spell the caster can help to prevent the target from suffering from the ill effects of 
Fatigue. The target of this spell will not receive another level of Fatigue for up to one hour per 
point of Magnitude. This spell cannot be recovered or released, until the spell ends.

Clear Skies
Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

This spell grants a short reprieve from poor weather. The caster creates mild, pleasant weather 
conditions in an area with a diameter equal to the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres. Rain 
stops, sweltering heat becomes cool breezes and dark clouds separate to reveal the bright and 
warming sun. This spell cannot alter magically-created weather effects of greater Magnitude.

186.204.39.123

179

Consecrate
Area Special, Duration Special, Rank Priest

This spell is as much a part of a temple’s foundation as is its cornerstone but may actually be 
cast almost anywhere. It creates a sphere with a radius of 10 metres per point of Magnitude. The 
consecrated sphere is sacred to the spellcaster’s god. Consecrate by itself does nothing to keep 
outsiders at bay but the caster of the spell will know immediately if a spell, spirit or someone who 
is not a member of his cult crosses the boundaries of the Consecrate spell.

While within the area of a Consecrate spell, an Initiate of the same religion gains a bonus to Lore 
(Specific Theology) tests made to cast Divine Magic spells equal to 5% per point of Magnitude. 
Initiates of other gods suffer an equal penalty to such tests.

Consecrate requires one hour per point of Magnitude to cast. This spell cannot be recovered or 
released, for as long as the spell is maintained. It is usually the duty of the Priest in charge of a 
temple or shrine to maintain the spell.

Crash of Thunder
Area Special, Instant, Ranged, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Resilience)

This spell allows the caster to summon a powerful blast of thunder from the open sky, directed 
toward his foes. The spell affects an area around the caster equal to 10 times the Magnitude in 
metres, forcing all non-Cult members to resist the spell. Those who fail are knocked from their 
feet  for  1D2  Combat  Actions  and  struck  deaf  for  1D6  minutes.  Should  anyone  fumble  the 
Resistance roll against the spell, they are struck permanently deaf. Also, any items of glass or 
pottery will shatter automatically within the area of the spell.

Cure Disease/Poison
Instant, Rank Acolyte, Touch

This spell lifts the effects of any mundane disease or poison afflicting the target; or magical ones 
whose potency is less than the Pact % of the caster.

If the disease is the result of a Disease Spirit and therefore magical in nature, the spell exorcises 
the Spirit as long its POW is within three times the spell’s Magnitude. For example, a Magnitude 
5 Cure Disease/Poison will exorcise any Disease Spirit of POW 15 or less.

Disarm
Instant, Ranged, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Persistence)

This spell gives the caster a powerful ability to take weaponry from the hands of a number of 
targets equal to the Magnitude of the spell. When cast, the target makes a Resistance roll for 
every weapon or shield in their hands at the time. Each failed roll means that the item is flung or 
torn from the target and lands 1D6 metres away in the direction toward the caster. It obviously 
has no effect on natural weaponry of any type.

180
186.204.39.123

Dismiss Elemental
Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Resilience)

Dismiss Elemental may be cast against Gnomes, Salamanders, Shades, Sylphs or Undines. The 
spell affects an elemental of up to one cubic metre in size per point of Magnitude. Failure to 
resist the spell causes the elemental to be dismissed and leaves the material substance of its body 
in place.

Dismiss Magic
Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate

Dismiss Magic may be cast against either a general target or a specific spell. Dismiss Magic will 
eliminate a combined Magnitude of spells equal to its own Magnitude, starting with the most 
powerful affecting the target. If it fails to eliminate any spell (because the spell’s Magnitude is too 
high), then its effects immediately end and no more spells will be eliminated. A spell cannot be 
partially eliminated, so a target under the effects of a spell whose Magnitude is higher than that 
of Dismiss Magic will not have any spells currently affecting it eliminated. The caster can also 
target Dismiss Magic against a single specific spell.

As long as Dismiss Magic’s Magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell’s Magnitude, the target 
spell is eliminated. Dismiss Magic may be fired defensively to neutralise incoming offensive spells, 
by using the Cast Spell Combat Action.

Ebb and Flow
Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Ranged

This spell allows a caster to seriously speed up or slow down a water-going vessel of any kind by 
forcing the water it rests in to either push faster or work against it. The caster can increase a craft’s 
speed by half-again, or decrease it to one-half, chosen at the time of the spell’s casting. The spell 
continues until dropped, allowing for higher-powered castings of the spell to make considerable 
changes to travel time by boat, ship or raft. This spell cannot be recovered or released, for as long 
as the spell is maintained.

Eclipse
Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

This spell turns day into night for a short period of time. Animals flee in confusion, people tend 
to question what they are seeing and fear is widespread. Whatever the reason for doing so, the 
caster can choose whether it is twilight or midnight black in an area whose diameter is equal to 
the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres.

Elemental Summoning
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell summons forth an elemental associated with the god’s portfolio. For example cults 
associated with an Earth god would summon Gnomes. The caster summons an elemental of 
one cubic metre per point of Magnitude in 1D3 Combat Rounds and remains in the area for 
the entire spell duration. For obvious reasons, the caster must have access to the same volume of 

186.204.39.123

181

the element’s material to cast this spell successfully. If less volume is available, then the caster can 
animate the material with a smaller elemental if desired. The elemental follows the directions of 
the caster for the duration of the spell but disperses once the spell expires.

Evergreen
Duration Special, Rank Initiate, Touch

This Spell grants the caster the ability to bless a single plant to become immune to the ravages 
of natural weather. A tree will not lose its leaves, flowers will not cease to bud and bloom even 
in winter and vines sprawl through the withering heat of high summer. Although this spell alters 
the natural state of the enchanted plant, it remains healthy – although some plants may not be 
able to seed if enchanted in this manner. This spell cannot be recovered or released, for as long 
as the spell is maintained.

Excommunicate
Permanent, Rank Priest, Resist (Persistence), Touch

This spell takes one hour to cast and severs the mystical link a worshipper enjoys with his god, 
causing the target of the spell to immediately and permanently lose all Divine Magic from the 
caster’s cult. In addition, the target also loses the Pact skill, freeing any POW dedicated to the 
god. The target will never again be able to learn or use Divine Magic spells from the cult, though 
he will still be able to use Lore (Specific Theology) for purely academic purposes.

Exorcism
Instant, Rank Acolyte, Resist (Persistence), Touch

By means of this spell, a divine spellcaster calls upon their god to drive out a spirit currently 
possessing a corporeal being. Whether the possession is dominant or covert is immaterial. The 
spellcaster must be open to the spirit world in order to cast this spell – he may not be shielded 
by a Spirit Block, or similar effect.

The spirit receives a –5% penalty per point of Magnitude to resist the spell. Failure severs the 
possession  but  leaves  the  spirit  free  to  engage  any  other  nearby  target  in  Spirit  Combat  if  it 
desires. Thus this spell can be potentially dangerous for the caster.

Extension
Duration Special, Rank Acolyte

This spell lengthens the duration of any Divine Magic spell with the Duration trait, for as long 
as the caster wishes to maintain it. Extension, and the spell it is extending, is cast simultaneously 
by the caster – this is an exception to the normal rule that only one Divine Magic spell may be 
cast during a single Combat Action.

If the Extension spell fails to cast while the augmented spell succeeds, the augmented spell is not 
extended and operates normally. If the augmented spell fails to cast while the Extension spell 
succeeds, the Extension spell is not cast. 

Extension prevents recovery or release of both the extended spell and the Extension itself, for as 
long as the spell is maintained.

182
186.204.39.123

Fear
Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This  spell  causes  the  target  to  be  gripped  with  overwhelming  fear.  Fear  has  no  effect  on 
unconscious targets, targets without an INT Characteristic or targets that are currently under 
the effect of another emotion controlling spell of higher Magnitude.

Targets that fail to resist flee in terror for a number of minutes equal to the Magnitude of the 
spell. Victims will avoid engaging in combat unless forced to.

Fog
Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

The caster creates a thick fog that obscures all vision and muffles hearing, in an area with a 
diameter equal to the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres. Anyone caught in the fog has their 
Perception skill reduced by half. The fog will remain in the area it was cast but can be pushed 
away or dispersed by a significantly strong wind. This spell is useful for stealthily moving large 
numbers of animals or troops.

Gleam
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This Spell enchants a single weapon with a speck of bright light that dances along its edge, always 
shining through the eyes of the target opposing its attacks. Anyone attempting to Parry or Evade 
a weapon currently under the effects of Gleam has their Skill Tests reduced by –5% per point 
of Magnitude, due to the dazzling light. Gleam is incompatible with any damage boosting or 
weapon skill improving magic, such as Bladesharp, Bludgeon or similar spells.

Heal Body
Instant, Rank Acolyte, Touch

This powerful spell instantly heals a number of Hit Locations equal to its Magnitude. Each Hit 
Location thus healed is restored to its maximum Hit Points. The caster may choose which Hit 
Locations are healed. Heal Body will even heal maimed, or reattach severed, locations if cast within 
an hour of receiving the Major Wound. Beyond this period the Regrow Limb spell is required.

Heal Mind
Instant, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell gives the caster the ability to remove derangements from a single target. In the case 
of magically-induced madness or similar instabilities, the spell works on a permanent basis if its 
Magnitude is equal to or greater than that of the magical disorder. 

Heal Wound
Instant, Rank Initiate, Touch

Heals one location back to its full Hit Points but will not cause a severed limb to reattach or 
regenerate. 

186.204.39.123

183

Illusion
Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist Special

This spell is used to temporarily modify the sensory projections of a single target, for example a 
cow can be made to look like a tiger, sound like a howling wolf when it moos, smell of roses, 
taste of butterscotch, feel like it is icy cold, or a combination of these. The caster can adjust one 
sensory projection per point of Magnitude. Once set, the illusion can no longer be modified for 
the duration of the spell.

Depending on the target, the illusion can extend up to its Magnitude in metres in any dimension. 
To cover a larger target, multiple castings of Illusion can be combined together, thus a small 
fortress could be made to appear as a briar covered hill for example. 

If  the  spell  is  cast  directly  upon  an  unwilling  living  target,  it  may  resist  with  its  Resilience. 
Observers who interact with the illusion are permitted an opposed Persistence roll against the 
spell, in order to resist any debilitating psychosomatic effects it creates, i.e. deafness, pain, nausea 
and so on. The illusion itself is incapable of causing harm but the underlying target remains as 
dangerous as it was before the spell.

Laughter
Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This spell infects the caster’s foes with laughter, making common activity difficult and exhausting. 
The caster picks a number of targets equal to the Magnitude of the spell, who all must resist the 
spell individually. Those who fail are subject to gut-wrenching laughter for the duration of the 
spell, suffering a – 20% penalty to all DEX-related Skill Tests and a level of Fatigue when the 
spell expires.

Lightning Strike
Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Evade)

This spell causes a sizzling bolt of lightning to streak from the hand of the caster toward the 
target. If the bolt is not evaded, the spell will cause 3D6 damage to a specified Hit Location. 
Natural and worn armour offers no protection against this damage but magical protection does. 
However,  any  magical  Armour  Points  the  target  possesses  are  reduced  by  1  AP  per  point  of 
Magnitude.

Madness
Instant, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This spell causes the target to lose contact with reality and become a gibbering loon. Madness 
has no effect on unconscious targets, targets without an INT Characteristic or targets that are 
currently under the effect of another sanity influencing spell of greater Magnitude.

Targets that fail to resist, gibber and rave uncontrollably for a number of minutes equal to the 
Magnitude of the spell. Victims will perform random Combat Actions during this period. Roll 
1D6. 1: Move to Close Combat attack a random target. 2: Run in a random direction. 3: Cast a 
spell at random target. 4: Use ranged attack against random target. 5: Shout at random target. 6: 
Dance wildly. In non-combat situations, the Games Master should allow the target to perform 
passive but perhaps more frightening or entertaining actions.

184
186.204.39.123

186.204.39.123

Meditate
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This  Spell  grants  a  single  target  the  ability  to  regain  their  magical  strength  through  mystic 
meditation. This requires the target to spend a quarter of an hour in solitude without interruption 
but will replenish all of the target’s spent Magic Points after that time. This meditation is not 
deep and can be interrupted by any outside contact but the target can make a Persistence Skill 
Test to ignore any outside stimuli that might wake him (as long as it is not a direct attack).

Mindblast
Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate, Resist (Persistence)

This spell applies a penalty to the victim’s INT equal to the Magnitude of the spell. This may 
cause the target to lose access to some Sorcery spells, or reduce the maximum magnitude of 
cast Common Magic. If the target’s INT is reduced below 8 they lose the power of speech and 
become animalistic in their thought processes.

Mindlink
Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate

This  spell  allows  the  transmission  of  conscious  thoughts,  spell  knowledge  and  Magic 
Points  between  participants.  Each  point  of  Magnitude  in  Mindlink  allows  mind-to-mind 
communication between two people, either creating several separate pairs of Mindlinked people, 
or making the caster the central hub of a small Mindlink network. In the second case, only the 
‘central’ Adventurer is linked directly to other participants. Thus, if Alaric is linked to Lilina and 
Thrace, Lilina and Thrace are not linked to each other.

Mindlink must be cast upon all participants at the same time and it is limited to consenting 
participants. Those participating in a Mindlink may use the spells and Magic Points of others 
they are linked to without consent but only if they have the appropriate skill to cast it, i.e. to 
use one of Alaric’s Divine spells, Lilina must possess the Lore (the Thunderer) skill. Divine spells 
used in this way must be recovered normally by the original owner.

Participants in a Mindlink have a special vulnerability to INT, POW, CHA and morale-effecting 
spells. Such a spell cast against any member of a Mindlink will affect all those connected, though 
all participants are entitled to resist individually.

Although participants in a Mindlink share Magic Points and conscious thought, they remain 
their own entity. Mindlink does not include hidden thoughts, memories, unconscious urges, 
skills or permanent spell knowledge. Any participant may sever their connection to the Mindlink 
as a Combat Action, or by leaving the spell’s range.

Rain
Area Special, Duration 15, Rank Acolyte

This Spell grants the caster the ability to bring rain from a clear sky. For the duration of the spell 
rain falls from the sky in an area whose diameter equals the Magnitude of the spell in kilometres. 
The rain can be as heavy or light as the caster desires, though not heavy enough to cause severe 
flooding but can be the difference between life and death for plants and thirsty men. If Rain is 
cast in sub zero temperatures, snow is created instead.

186
186.204.39.123

Reflection
Duration 15, Ranged, Rank Initiate

This spell reflects incoming spells aimed at the target or his equipment, redirecting the spell back 
at the original caster. It will not have any effect on spells that are already affecting the target. The 
effects of Reflection depend on the relative Magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell – see 
the Reflection Results table for more details.

Reflection is incompatible with Absorption, Shield and Spirit Block.

Reflection Results
Incoming Spell’s Magnitude is. . .
Equal to or weaker than Reflection’s 
Magnitude.
1 or more points stronger than Reflection’s 
Magnitude.

Regenerate Limb
Concentration Special, Rank Acolyte, Touch

Effect
Incoming spell reflected and Reflection 
remains.
Reflection eliminated and incoming spell 
takes effect.

This  spell  causes  a  location  severed  or  maimed  by  a  Major  Wound  to  regenerate,  or  if  the 
detached location is still present, for it to reattach itself to its stump.

Regenerate  Limb  takes  a  number  of  rounds  equal  to  the  location’s  HP  to  reattach  or  repair, 
during which time the caster must maintain concentration on the spell. The Hit Location is 
immediately restored to 1 Hit Point at the end of this period. Regenerating a severed location 
works the same way but takes minutes instead of rounds.

Resurrect
Concentration Special, Rank Priest, Resist (Persistence), Touch

This spell brings the dead back to life. The body of the deceased must be present and cannot be 
lacking any Hit Locations vital for life. If the target died due to disease or poison, the ailment 
must be eliminated first or the spell will fail.

Resurrect summons the deceased spirit to approach its former body. The caster of the spell must 
then persuade the returning spirit to re-enter its body – while those with unfinished aims or 
seeking revenge may be more than willing to return to life, those who died in lingering pain due 
to old age or persistent illness may be less than happy at a return to corporeality and may resist 
the summoning.

Resurrect takes a number of hours equal to the target’s POW Characteristic to take effect, during 
which  time  the  caster  must  maintain  concentration  on  the  spell.  A  resurrected  Adventurer 
returns to life with zero Hit Points on all locations.

After death, Resurrect must be cast within a number of days equal to the Magnitude of the spell, 
otherwise the magic automatically fails.

Sever Spirit
Instant, Rank Priest, Resist (Resilience)

This spell severs the bond between body and soul, to devastating effect. The target may resist 
the spell by opposing his Resilience with the caster’s Lore (Specific Theology) roll made to cast 
the spell. If the resistance attempt fails, then the target dies. If the resistance roll succeeds, then 
the target takes one point of damage for every two points of Magnitude of the spell to each Hit 
Location simultaneously. This may, in some cases, still result in the death of the spell’s target, if 
further Resilience rolls for the damage sustained are failed.

Shield
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This spell protects the caster from physical and magical attacks. Each point of Magnitude either 
gives  the  caster  one  Armour  Point  on  all  Hit  Locations  or  one  point  of  magical  protection, 
as  per  Countermagic  Shield,  or  a  combination  thereof.  These  effects  are  cumulative  with 
other  Common  Magic  spells,  as  well  as  any  physical  armour  the  caster  is  wearing.  Shield  is 
incompatible with Absorption, Reflection and Spirit Block, as well as further castings of Shield 
on the same recipient.

Soul Sight
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

This  spell  allows  the  recipient  to  see  the  POW  aura  of  anyone  he  looks  at,  enabling  him  to 
discern that creature’s current Magic Points, as well as the nature of any active spells, the source 
of their magic and any enchanted items the creature is carrying. It also allows the recipient to 
see into the spirit world.

Spirit Block
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

Spirit Block is one of the most powerful ways in which to block the malign influence of ghosts, 
wraiths and other creatures of the spirit world. The recipient of Spirit Block may only be affected 
by spirits with a POW greater than the spell’s Magnitude, squared.

Sunspear
Instant, Ranged, Rank Priest, Resist (Evade)

This spell will only function in direct sunlight. When cast a shaft of light, two metres wide, 
streaks from the sky to blast a single target. If the target does not evade, the blazing light will 
burn it for 2D6 damage per Hit Location (roll separately for each location). Armour Points are 
not effective against this damage and it counts as both magical and fire damage.

Sureshot
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

Sureshot magically guides the trajectory of missiles thrown or fired by the recipient so that they 
almost always hit, no matter the situational modifiers or cover, as long as the target is within 
range of the weapon.

For the duration of the spell, any failed missile attack roll is treated as a success instead. Fumbles, 
normal successes and criticals remain unaffected. The target of the missile attack can still attempt 
to Parry or Evade as normal.

Sureshot may not be combined with Firearrow, Multimissile or Speedart – Sureshot will always 
take precedence in such cases. Precise Attack attempts do not work whilst this spell is operating.

True (Weapon)
Duration 15, Rank Initiate, Touch

Cast on the specified type of Close Combat Weapon, this spell doubles that weapon’s normal 
damage dice. Other bonuses, such as Damage Modifiers, are not affected. The wielder of the 
weapon should roll the weapon’s damage twice and total the result.

sorcery

Sorcery  uses  formulae,  both  written  and  mentally  envisaged,  to  achieve  magical  effects.  A 
somewhat crude way of looking at Sorcery is to consider it as short-cuts and bypasses that alter 
the fabric of creation to serve the caster’s own ends. Whereas Common Magic is a miscellany of 
charms and cantrips, and Divine Magic channels the powers of the gods, Sorcery is a deliberate 
attempt to bend the way the universe functions.

Sorcery Grimoires

Sorcerers  record  their  spells  in  grimoires.  A  grimoire  can  hold  just  one  spell  or  many.  Some 
grimoires are disparate collections with no single theme whereas others are deliberate collections 
of spells of a particular nature, gathered together to reflect a particular mindset or requirement.

Grimoires can take unusual forms. In some cultures they are often recorded on scrolls or within 
tomes. However these are perishable, so some civilisations engrave grimoires on plates of metal, 
carve them into stone walls or even embed them in crystalline formations. Since the recording of 
a spell takes up a large amount of space, most enduring grimoires are near immovable and even 
the smallest scroll with a single spell is large and unwieldy.

Sorcery and Other Types of Magic
Because  Sorcery  is  based  on  deliberate  endeavours  and  has  little  basis  in  naturally  occurring 
magic, many cultures view it with deep suspicion and may shun it completely. Sorcery may be 
viewed as heretical and manipulative – magic that breaks the very nature of a divine relationship 
or corrupts the stability of the spirit world.

Some sorcerers view Common and Divine Magic with contempt. A good sorcerer does not need 
to rely on the relationships these kinds of magic require; all he needs is his own intellect and his 
grimoire. Sorcery can remove the tiresome, restrictive constraints necessary to the other kinds of 
magic. He can, if he chooses, stand alone and still wield great power. In more open minded societies 
where Sorcery forms part of a cult’s structure, it is often at the expense of Divine Magic – either 
because those who established the cult possessed no celestial or otherworldly relationships to begin 
with, or have lost it through overly dedicating their energies to developing the power Sorcery offers.

How Sorcery Works

A sorcerer works magic through two skills, Sorcery (Grimoire) and Manipulation. 

Sorcery (Grimoire) (INT x2)
The  Sorcery  (Grimoire)  skill  reflects  the  knowledge  of  all  the  spells  learned  from  within  a 
particular grimoire. It is this skill which a sorcerer rolls against to see if they cast a spell correctly. 
The skill also limits the effect of the spell. A sorcerer can study more than one Grimoire and thus 

190
186.204.39.123

possess many Sorcery (Grimoire) skills. Sorcerers are not in the habit of carrying their grimoires 
around with them: a grimoire is a powerful document and the physical thing is often closely 
guarded. Therefore sorcerers are forced to memorise spells from their grimoire(s). The complex 
equations, symbols, incantations and arcane gestures consume a great deal of mental capacity. 
Therefore no sorcerer can ever memorise more spells, from one or multiple grimoires, than he 
has INT, with one spell occupying one point of the INT Characteristic. A sorcerer with INT 
16 could thus keep in his mind up to 16 spells from the same or multiple grimoires. Casting a 
spell does not erase it from his mind; but to change which spells he has memorised a sorcerer 
must spend 1D6 hours expelling an old spell from memory and memorising a new one from its 
grimoire.

For Example, Jedekiah is a sorcerer of one of the illustrious Jade Circle Schools. As a member of the 
Seventh Circle sect he has Sorcery (Seventh Jade Grimoire) 60% and Sorcery (Book of the Whisperer) 
45%.  His  INT  is  14. The  Seventh  Jade  grimoire  has  over  a  dozen  spells  in  its  pages  whilst  the 
Whisperer’s Bookhas only six. Jedekiah can therefore memorise any combination of spells from either 
grimoire as long as the total number of spells does not exceed 14. To successfully cast those spells found 
in the Seventh Jade Grimoire he needs to roll 60% or less; and 45% or less to cast those from the 
Whisperer’sBook.

If the same spell is found in one or more grimoires a sorcerer knows, he always casts it at the 
highest rated Sorcery (Grimoire) percentage.

Manipulation (INT+POW)
On their own, Sorcery spells can be quite weak and limited in their scope. However a sorcerer’s 
true power lies in his ability to extend the fundamental aspects of all spells, enhancing their 
reach. By default, Sorcery spells cast without any Manipulation have a Magnitude of 1, a Range 
of  touch,  a  Duration  equal  to  the  caster’s  POW  in  minutes  and  focus  upon  a  single  target. 
However,  the  Manipulation  skill  allows  a  sorcerer  to  modify  the  spell’s  Magnitude,  Range, 
Duration, Targets and even Combine several spells into a single casting.

Manipulation  is  a  single  skill  which  can  be  applied  to  all  known  Sorcery  spells;  a  separate 
Manipulation per Grimoire is not necessary.

The Manipulation skill is never rolled against when casting a spell. Instead, each 10% or fraction 
thereof of the Manipulation skill allows one point of Manipulation to be assigned to a single 
Sorcery spell component. Sorcerers therefore need to specify at the moment of casting how the 
points of their Manipulation skill will be used. For example, Jedekiah with Manipulation 50% 
could place three points into manipulating Duration and two into manipulating Range; or five into 
a single component. 

Manipulation of the following components is possible:

Magnitude: Used to penetrate magical defences or resist magical attacks.
Range: Used to increase the distance a spell can be cast over.
Duration: Used to extend the period of time the spell’s effects last.
Targets: Used to increase the number of targets affected by the spell.
Combine: Used to fuse together several spells into a single casting.

The  Sorcery  Manipulation Table  shows  what  effect  each  point  of  Manipulation  has  on  the 
different spell components. It takes no Manipulation to cast a Sorcery spell in its basic format 
(as indicated by the ‘None’ row).

Magnitude
Sorcery spells have a default Magnitude of 1 at no additional Magic Point cost. It costs one 
Magic Point to augment the Magnitude of a Sorcery spell, regardless of its final intensity.

Manipulating this component allows the sorcerer to increase the Magnitude of a spell. For Sorcery 
spells Magnitude is only used to see if it will overcome magical defences or resist magical attacks. It 
does not modify the effect of the spell which is controlled by the Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.

Range
Sorcery spells have a default Range of Touch, at no additional Magic Point cost. It costs one 
Magic Point to augment the Range of a Sorcery spell, regardless of its final distance.

Manipulating this component allows the sorcerer to increase the Range of a Sorcery spell. Unlike 
other manipulations the range value does not progress linearly, enabling sorcerers to cast spells 
over great distances. However since most spells require the target to be under direct observation, 
a sorcerer often needs other forms of perception or magical aid to cast sorcery reaching beyond 
their immediate senses. 

Spells cast at a Range of Touch require the sorcerer to make a successful Unarmed attack on 
a resisting target. To avoid touch spells a recipient must use Evade to dodge the attack, since 
defending with a Combat Skill will still transfer the magical effect through the parrying weapon 
or shield.

If Range is augmented beyond Touch then the caster automatically strikes his intended target, 
unless the target is able to dive for cover or flee out of reach before the spell is completed.

Duration
Sorcery spells have a default Duration equal to the POW of the caster in minutes, at no additional 
Magic Point cost. It costs one Magic Point to augment the Duration of a Sorcery spell, regardless 
of its final time span.

Manipulating this component allows the sorcerer to increase the Duration of a Sorcery spell. The 
maximum Duration to which the spell can be increased to is noted in the Sorcery Manipulation table. 

192
186.204.39.123

Targets
Sorcery spells have a default Target of one person or item, at no additional Magic Point cost. It 
costs one Magic Point to augment the Targets of a Sorcery spell, regardless of the final number 
of recipients.

Manipulating this component allows the sorcerer to increase the number of targets of a Sorcery 
spell. The maximum number of targets the spell can affect is noted in the Sorcery Manipulation 
table. If the spell is cast successfully, the effect of the spell is applied multiple times, once for each 
target included; the spell’s potency is never divided between them.

Combine
Manipulating  this  component  allows  the  sorcerer  to  combine  the  effects  of  multiple  Sorcery 
spells in a single casting, so they will affect the target simultaneously. This is the most powerful 
aspect of Sorcery, as it allows a skilful sorcerer to use his Magic Points judiciously and achieve 
multiple effects within a short space of time.

A spell may not be combined with itself – only different spells may be combined.
If the combined spells come from different grimoires, then the lowest Sorcery (Grimoire) skill is 
used as the base casting chance.

The spells must all have the same target or targets. A sorcerer cannot combine a Palsy targeting 
an enemy and a Spell Resistance targeting himself, for instance.

Any other Manipulation effects applied in a combined spellcasting apply to each and every one 
of the spells involved. Only one Magic Point need be spent per Manipulation effect, regardless 
of the number of spells involved.

Each additional spell added to a combined spellcasting costs one extra Magic Point and reduces 
the casting chance by 10%.

Casting Sorcery Spells
A sorcerer must be able to gesture with his hands, be able to visualise the lay-out of the spell as it 
appears in the grimoire and be able to chant in order to complete the casting. Whenever a spell 
is cast, there is always a sight and sound that nearby creatures can detect, be it a flash of light, a 
crack of thunder or a shimmering in the air. The exact effects are up to the Games Master and 
player to decide but attempting to invoke a spell subtly permits nearby observers an opposed roll 
of their Perception versus the casting roll to spot the invocation.

Casting a Sorcery spell requires a successful Skill Test of the Sorcery (Grimoire) skill to which 
that spell belongs. 

Magic Points
Sorcery spells cost one Magic Point plus as many Magic Points as the number of Manipulation 
effects  applied  to  it.  Jedekiah,  for  example,  casting  a  Sorcery  spell  upon  himself  with  no 
Manipulation uses only a single Magic Point. Applying five Manipulations would cost six Magic 
Points (one for the basic spell, plus one point per Manipulation). Casting two spells upon himself 
at the same time with the same Manipulations applied to both spells would cost seven Magic 
Points, as well as reducing his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill by 10%.

186.204.39.123

193

Casting Modifiers
Sorcery spellcasting tests apply the same modifiers as Common Magic spellcasting tests. 

Casting Critical Successes
If  the  Sorcery  (Grimoire)  roll  is  a  critical  success,  the  spell  costs  no  Magic  Points  to  cast, 
irrespective of the amount of Manipulation applied to it.

Casting Failures
If the casting test fails the spell does not take effect and costs the caster a single Magic Point.

Casting Fumbles
If the Sorcery roll is fumbled the spell fails and the sorcerer loses the full Magic Point cost of 
the spell. 

Casting Time
All Sorcery spells take as many Combat Actions to cast as the number of Manipulations used 
to cast them, with a minimum casting time of 1. No other Combat Action may be taken while 
casting a spell, although the Adventurer may still walk up to his Movement rate while spellcasting.

A spell’s effect takes effect at the end of its last casting Combat Action.

Physical and magical attacks on a sorcerer as he casts automatically ruin the spell if he suffers 
a Major Wound, is immobilised, or is prevented from observing the target. Lesser distractions 
require successful Persistence tests to maintain concentration on the spell.

Dismissing Sorcery Spells
Like  Common  Magic,  a  caster  can  dismiss  any  active  Sorcery  spell(s)  he  has  cast  as  a  single 
Combat Action, at any point.

Acquiring Sorcery
Adventurers desiring to learn Sorcery must fulfil certain conditions:

Have access to the grimoire from which the spell originates.
Be able to read the language of the grimoire.
Have time to conduct the study in quiet and solitude.
Possess enough Improvement Rolls to learn the Sorcery (Grimoire) skill for that grimoire.

No matter how many spells are contained within, it requires one week of studying a grimoire 
to  gain  its  specific  Sorcery  (Grimoire)  skill. This  is  treated  as  learning  a  new  Advanced  Skill 
and starts at a base percentage of INT x2. Once the theories and philosophy described by the 
grimoire are understood, the sorcerer may then begin to learn the spell or spells contained within.

Each spell takes a further week and two Improvement Rolls to learn, after which the sorcerer will 
then be able to cast that spell using the Sorcery (Grimoire) skill for the grimoire it belongs to. 
A sorcerer belonging to a sorcery cult is usually forbidden from transcribing the spells from the 
grimoire – as doing so may allow the knowledge to spread beyond their reach.

194
186.204.39.123

Depending on the setting and culture, admittance to such grimoires may be difficult. Whilst 
membership of some sorcery cults or schools may allow study of their grimoire free of charge; 
others might require gifts paid, quests performed or attaining a specific membership rank before 
granting access.

Spell Traits and Descriptions
Every Sorcery spell is defined by several traits defining the spell and how it is used in the game. 
A description then follows describing the spell’s precise effects. The traits used by Sorcery spells 
are detailed here.

By default all Sorcery spells are binary in effect rather than progressive: they either work or they 
do not. The strength of the effect, or scope of the target they can affect, is dependent on the 
caster’s Sorcery skill in the grimoire from which that spell comes.

Autonomous:  The  spell’s  effects  will  remain  until  its  duration  ends,  without  need  for 
concentration.

Concentration: The spell’s active effects continue so long as the Adventurer concentrates on 
it. Once focus is dropped, the spell’s effect ceases or remains static until concentration can be 
resumed. A sorcerer may move or perform non-complex actions without penalty. More stressful 
situations, such as walking a narrow ledge, engaging in combat, suffering serious injury, or casting 
another spell immediately require a Persistence roll to maintain focus. By default a sorcerer may 
only concentrate on a single Concentration spell at any one time.

Resist  (Evade/Persistence/Resilience):  An  offensively  cast  spell  does  not  take  effect 
automatically. The target may make an Opposed Test of their Evade, Persistence or Resilience 
skill (as specified by the spell) against the casting roll of the sorcerer, to avoid the effect of the 
spell entirely. To resist using the Evade skill, the Adventurer must expend a Combat Action.

Abjure (Substance/Process)
Autonomous

There are many Abjure spells; for instance, Abjure Air, Abjure Food, Abjure Water and so on. 
Each  discrete  Abjure  spell  permits  a  sorcerer  to  forgo  a  single  specific  substance  or  process 
necessary for life, such as air, water, food, sleep and so forth. The sorcerer can affect a living target 
of up to three points of SIZ for every 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, utterly removing the 
need for that particular requirement until the spell ends. Thus an Abjure (Air) spell could allow 
a sorcerer to move underwater without needing to breath.
 
Many exotic versions of this spell exist, which affect dreams, pain or even aging.

Animate (Substance)
Concentration, Resist (Special)*

This spell animates a specific type of substance as indicated by the particular spell; thus there are 
many variants of Animate available. The sorcerer animates three points of SIZ or a cubic metre of 
insubstantial material for every 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, causing it to move about and 
interact clumsily with its surroundings. The substance moves at a rate of one metre by default, 

186.204.39.123

195

although points of SIZ or ENC may be substituted for extra movement on a three for one basis; 
and cubic metres on a one for one basis.

Jedekiah knows the Animate (Wind) spell and has increased his Sorcery (Seventh Jade Grimoire) 
to 73%. He is sailing a small skiff across the sea when he sees a warship bearing down on him. 
In desperation he tries to escape and invokes the wind to his aid. The Games Master decides 
that the skiff’s sails hold two cubic metres of air, so the remaining six cubic metres Jedekiah 
can normally control may be used instead to increase the wind’s speed. Converting them over 
and adding to the base one metre speed provided by the spell, allows the skiff to be blown at an 
additional seven metres per round. More than enough to outdistance the warship.

The sorcerer’s chance to have the animated object perform any complex physical skill is equal 
to his own chance to perform that action halved (before any modifiers). If combined with the 
appropriate Form/Set spell (through application of the Combine Manipulation), the caster can 
perform much finer manoeuvring of the target. In this case, the animated object will use the 
caster’s full skill scores for physical activities.

*The myriad versions of this spell normally only affect inanimate matter, such as clay, steel, dead flesh 
and so on; or ethereal substances such as air, fire, darkness. If the substance is already under magical 
control or is a living elemental, then the target gains a Resistance roll of some form, such as an opposed 
magical skill or Persistence. Darker versions of this spell are rumoured which allow sorcerers to animate 
living creatures and control them like puppets.

Attract (Harm)
Autonomous, Resist (Persistence)

This spell steers attacks of a singular type within its range, so they strike the recipient instead. It 
works differently according to the type of harm affected by the spell variant. This can even cause 
a spell or missile attack to turn back upon its own caster!

Magic – Draws offensive spells of up to 1 Magnitude per 10% known in the Sorcery (Grimoire) 
skill.
Missiles  –  Attracts  all  missile  attacks  which  inflict  up  to  a  maximum  (including  magical 
augments) of 1 Hit Point per 10% known in the Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.
Spirits – Baits any hostile spirit with up to 3 POW per 10% known in the Sorcery (Grimoire) 
skill.
Energy – Redirects all sources of harm linked to a particular energy or effect, such as fire, poison, 
cold, undeath and similar forces.

Banish
Autonomous, Resist (Persistence)

Allows a sorcerer to dismiss spiritual or demonic entities of up to 3 POW per 10% of his Sorcery 
(Grimoire) skill. If the spell overcomes the Persistence of the targeted entity it is sent back to 
the Plane from whence it originally came. The spell does not work against otherworldly beings 
which are bound within a material object or fetish. However, if the entity is temporarily freed 
from its binding to perform a service, then the spell breaks whatever magical hold linking it to 
its owner/master. Likewise the spell cannot cast forth a spirit or demon possessing a victim, only 
one that is first tricked into abandoning the host.

196
186.204.39.123

Castback
Autonomous

Castback is a defensive invocation shielding the sorcerer from hostile magic and has a chance 
of sending it back to the attacking spellcaster. It reflects hostile magic of up to 1 Magnitude per 
10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill and only affects spells that target the user specifically 
and possess the Resist trait. Such spells may affect the protected Adventurer normally but if it is 
resisted, the spell is launched back at the person who cast it. 

Damage Enhancement
Autonomous

This  spell  can  be  cast  upon  anything  capable  of  inflicting  physical  damage;  weapons,  traps, 
unarmed attacks or even other offensive spells. Attacks and weapons, where maximum damage 
does not exceed two Hit Points per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, will always do 
the maximum amount of damage without needing to roll.

Thus a sorcerer with Damage Boosting 43% could cast the spell on a War Sword, which normally 
does  1D8  damage.  If  successful,  the  sword  would  then  automatically  inflict  eight  points  of 
damage every hit until the spell ended.

Damage Resistance
Autonomous

This spell protects the body of the recipient (including clothing and small belongings carried 
upon his person) by generating an invisible force field, which deflects incoming damage. Any 
attack where damage does not exceed one Hit Point per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) 
skill,  glances  off  with  no  effect  –  although  the  protected  Adventurer  may  still  suffer  from 
Knockback if applicable. Attacks that inflict more damage than the spell can handle, completely 
bypass it with no reduction.

Damage Resistance may be combined with other spells which provide magical Armour Points. 
In this case the damage is compared to the Damage Resistance spell first and only encounters the 
Protection spell if the Damage Resistance is bypassed.

Diminish (Characteristic)
Autonomous, Resist (Persistence/Resilience)

A Diminish spell exists for each Characteristic (so, Diminish Strength, Diminish Constitution 
and so on). The spell temporarily reduces a target’s Characteristic by two points per 10% of 
the  sorcerer’s  Sorcery  (Grimoire)  skill. To  be  effective,  the  targeted  creature  must  possess  the 
Characteristic in question. If used malevolently Diminish (STR, DEX, CON or SIZ) are resisted 
with Resilience; Diminish (INT, POW or CHA) are resisted with Persistence. The minimum 
value any Characteristic can be reduced to is 1.

Note that creatures affected by Diminish SIZ actually shrink, rather than becoming wasted and 
skeletal as they do with the Tap spell. Diminish is incompatible with any other Characteristic 
reducing spell.

186.204.39.123

197

Dominate (Species)
Concentration, Resist (Persistence)

This  spell  gives  the  caster  control  over  a  creature  belonging  to  a  specific  species:  thus  many 
variations of this spell exist. A sorcerer may attempt to dominate a target of up to 3 INT per 
10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. If the target fails to resist, it must obey the commands of 
the caster for the duration of the spell. Suicidal commands instantly break the spell, although the 
target might be tricked into doing something indirectly fatal. Commands which run contrary 
to the target’s ethics or instincts allow the dominated subject another opposed Persistence roll 
to escape control.

The controlled target shares a limited one-way telepathic link with the sorcerer by which it can 
receive orders. If the sorcerer and the dominated creature do not share a common language, the 
sorcerer can order it by forming a mental image of the actions he wishes it to perform. However, 
control of the subject lapses once it leaves the normal Range parameters. To keep track of what 
a dominated subject is doing once out of sight; the sorcerer must use some other form of magic.

A separate Dominate spell must be learned for different species. However, each variant is quite 
broad in scope, covering an entire family of a type of creature. For example: felines, canines, 
bears, fish, snakes and so forth.

Enhance (Characteristic)
Autonomous, Resist (Persistence/Resilience)

An Enhance spell exists for each Characteristic (so, Enhance Strength, Enhance Constitution 
and  so  on).  Essentially  the  reverse  of  the  Diminish  spell,  Enhance  temporarily  increases  the 
specified Characteristic by two points per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. A creature 
must have the Characteristic in question to be affected and the Characteristic cannot be boosted 
beyond twice its original value. 

If used malevolently, Enhance (STR, DEX, CON or SIZ) are resisted with Resilience; Enhance 
(INT, POW or CHA) are resisted with Persistence.

This spell is incompatible with any other Characteristic boosting spell.

Fly
Concentration, Resist (Evade)

Using  this  spell  allows  the  caster  (or  whomever  or  whatever  he  targets  with  the  spell)  to  fly. 
A sorcerer can affect a target of up to 3 SIZ per 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. Those 
affected by this spell move at the spellcaster’s behest, not their own. By default the spell grants 
a Movement rate of one metre per round, although points of SIZ may be substituted for extra 
movement on a three for one basis.

Offensive use of the spell allows a victim to attempt an opposed Evade roll (or equivalent) to 
initially break free of the spell’s grip.

198
186.204.39.123

186.204.39.123

Form/Set (Substance)
Autonomous, Resist (Resilience)

There are many Form/Set spells in existence, each one controlling a general type of substance. 
The categories are broadly based upon form and material, for example; gases, liquids, earth and 
stone, metal, wood, flames, darkness, ice, flesh and bone and so on.

The spell affects up to three points of SIZ (or one cubic metre of an ethereal/gaseous substance) 
per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. For the duration of the spell, the affected material 
can be formed into whatever shape the sorcerer desires; although complex configurations require 
an appropriate craft skill and several rounds of concentration to mould. Assuming the material is 
solid, the substance retains its shape at the end of the spell. More mutable substances like water 
immediately flow back to their natural form.

This spell can also be used to mend damage done to an object. The sorcerer must be able to affect 
the entire object and must succeed at an appropriate Craft test; but if successful he will restore 
the full Hit Points to an item. 

Normally this spell is only employed on inanimate substances. However, if used against a living 
or animate creature, the spell must be able to affect the entire target and the target receives an 
opposed Resilience roll to resist. No damage is inflicted on those that fail but their appearance 
and outward physique may be warped as desired.

Glow
Autonomous, Resist (Evade)

This spell causes an area to glow with a soft light, bright enough to be able to read by. Sorcerers 
can illuminate a space of up to one metre radius for every 10% of their Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. 

The light is able to counter Darkness spells equal to or less than its Magnitude. However, if the 
Darkness spell is centred upon an animate creature, then the target may resist using its Evade skill. 

Haste
Autonomous

Haste increases the Movement rate of whatever it is cast on. The spell affects targets of up to 3 
SIZ per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. By default, the base Movement of the target 
is doubled. To further improve speed a sorcerer may substitute surplus points of SIZ for extra 
movement, each 3 SIZ giving an extra one metre. Haste is incompatible with other Movement 
boosting spells.

Hinder
Autonomous, Resist (Evade)

Hinder decreases the movement rate of whatever it is cast on. The spell affects targets of up to 3 SIZ 
per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. By default, the base Movement of the target is halved. 
To further reduce speed a sorcerer may substitute surplus points of SIZ for extra effect, each 3 SIZ 
giving an additional reduction of one metre per round. A target’s Movement cannot be lowered to less 
than one with this spell. Hinder is incompatible with other Movement slowing spells.

200
186.204.39.123

Holdfast
Autonomous, Resist (Resilience)

Holdfast causes an object of up to 3 SIZ per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, to 
merge with another, contacting surface. The binding is unbreakable by normal means, save for 
the destruction of the target or the surface it is bonded to. Only magic can dispel the effect, by 
overcoming the Magnitude of the Holdfast.

This spell can affect both organic and inorganic substances. However, if a sorcerer attempts to 
bond a living being, or anything it is holding or wearing, the spell may be resisted using the 
Resilience skill. Failing to resist indicates the victim is bound to an object it touches, or his sword 
is bound inside its scabbard for example.

Intuition
Concentration, Resist (Persistence)

Intuition allows a sorcerer to discern the emotions and motives of the target, as if he had made 
a successful Insight roll. The caster may affect targets of up to 3 POW per 10% of his Sorcery 
(Grimoire) skill. The sorcerer however is unable to read memories or guarded thoughts, so a 
target who is aware that this spell is being used may attempt to veil his feelings, gaining another 
opposed test of their Persistence roll against the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) percentage, each time 
the caster attempts to discern a new fact.

Mystic Vision
Concentration

This spell allows the caster to perceive magic, by augmenting his primary senses. It allows him 
to see, hear or perhaps even smell spells, enchanted items and even a creature’s Magic Points. 
The sorcerer must be able to actually detect the creature or object for this spell to work. Mystic 
Vision also enables observation into the hero, spirit and essence planes – although the spell does 
not grant access. 

Sorcerers will either roughly know how many Magic Points an object or creature currently has 
(1–10, 11–20, 21–30 and so forth), or will automatically be aware of a spell’s magical origin 
(Common, Divine or Sorcery).

Spells or enchantments of up to one Magic Point (or POW) per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery 
(Grimoire) skill, have all their attributes revealed – including what the spell does, whether it has 
been overcharged, enchantment conditions and the unique ‘aura’ of who cast it; which can be 
used to identify other spells cast by the same person.

Neutralise Magic 
Autonomous

Neutralise Magic negates a combined Magnitude of spells on a target. The spell affects up to 
one point of Magnitude for every 10% of the sorcerer’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. It works by 
dismissing the most powerful spell it can act on, reducing its own effect by the Magnitude of the 
eliminated spell, then continues to dismiss the next most powerful spell it can still affect. A spell 
cannot be partially eliminated, so only ‘complete’ spells are negated. 

186.204.39.123

201

Jedekiah is under the effect of a Magnitude 2 Protection spell, a Magnitude 4 Haste spell and 
a Magnitude 6 Damage Resistance spell. When hit by a Neutralise Magic cast at 44% (affects 
5 Magnitude), the Damage Resistance spell is ignored as it is too powerful. The Haste spell is 
neutralised but this reduces the Neutralise Magic’s effect to 1, which is not enough to take out 
the Protection spell.

Enchantments and other permanent magical effects are temporarily neutralised for the duration 
of the spell.

Neutralise Magic can be used defensively, as if parrying or evading to neutralise incoming spells.

Palsy
Autonomous, Resist (Resilience)

This spell paralyses one random Hit Location on the target. The sorcerer can affect locations of 
up to ome Hit Point per 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. The effect of the spell depends on 
the location struck. A limb stops working; the abdomen causes both legs to collapse and the head 
or chest results in unconsciousness.

Phantom (Sense)
Concentration, Resist (Special)

Each specific Phantom spell produces an illusion which affects a different sense or perception. 
There are five basic versions, one for each of sight, sound, smell, taste and touch; but there are 
also variants for unusual sensory mechanisms (such as the darksense of trolls). Illusions produced 
by each Phantom spell are stimulations of the target’s own perceptions and nervous system – not 
temporary manifestations of reality. 

Targets of a phantasm must succeed in an opposed test of their Persistence against the caster’s 
Sorcery (Grimoire), otherwise they truly believe what they are experiencing.

Phantasms cannot cause direct harm, although they may be injurious in an indirect manner, 
such as creating an illusion of a cow over a griffon, or by masking the taste of a virulent poison. 
However,  most  effects  are  psychosomatic  in  nature  and  permit  further  Resistance  rolls  when 
used offensively.

Phantom spells can react to their surroundings as long as the sorcerer maintains concentration 
over them.  If  concentration lapses,  then the  illusion remains static  within the victim’s  mind, 
continuing to produce the last effect imagined by the caster – the smell of roses, a moaning wind, 
bone biting cold and so on. The sorcerer can resume concentration at a later time to change the 
illusion as long as the spell has not expired. Multiple Phantom spells can be concentrated on 
simultaneously as long as they are cast as a single spell using the Combine manipulation. 

Spells providing magical protection block a Phantom (Sense) spell of equal or lesser Magnitude. 

Odour
This spell reproduces any single scent, anything from the delectable odour of lotus perfume to 
the stench of rotting flesh. If used offensively and the caster overcomes the target in an opposed 
roll  of  Sorcery  (Grimoire)  versus  Resilience,  an  odour  can  be  created  which  incapacitates  or 
entrances those who smell it.

202
186.204.39.123

Taste
This illusion creates or hides any single taste for consumables, substances or persons within the 
spell’s effect. If used offensively, such as creating the burning effect of hot chillies to cause the 
victim  to  gag,  the  caster  must  overcome  the  target  in  an  opposed  roll  of  Sorcery  (Grimoire) 
versus Resilience. Several Phantom (Taste) spells could, for example, make a meagre meal of 
boiled worms, sour berries and nettle leaves taste like the recipient’s favourite meal – although 
the texture might need some work.

Sight
Creates  a  visual  illusion  of  anything  the  caster  can  imagine.  The  vision  is  completely  non-
corporeal,  so  physical  interaction  passes  straight  through.  If  used  subtly,  it  can  augment  or 
modify the appearance of an already existing target; granting outlandish clothing or changing 
colour for example. Creating a complete fabrication out of context with the setting, or physically 
interacting  with  it,  allows  the  viewer  an  opposed  roll  of  their  Perception  against  the  caster’s 
Sorcery (Grimoire). Animate creatures produced by this spell, which appear to perform complex 
physical actions, use the relevant skills of the sorcerer. For example, an illusionary giant ant sent 
to attack the recipient would use the caster’s own Unarmed combat skill to fight.

Sound
This spell creates an audible illusion, anything from a whisper to a clap of thunder. The caster 
can manipulate the nature and volume of the sound as long as he continues to concentrate upon 
it.  Although  a  sorcerer  can  create  very  loud  sounds,  he  cannot  cause  permanent  deafness  or 
damage with them. However, the illusionary volume can be such that recipients standing next to 
each other need a Perception roll to hear each other speak; and any task which requires hearing 
one’s own voice or maintaining concentration (such as spell casting), must win an opposed test 
of Persistence against the spell to continue.

Touch
This spell creates an illusion of tactility, which can be Combined with other illusions to give 
them a greater sense of reality. It can simulate any type of tactual sensation from feathery to 
prickly,  soft  to  hard  and  even  hot  and  cold.  Since  the  spell  simply  produces  an  illusionary 
sensation in the nerves of those who touch the phantasm, it cannot inflict and is itself, immune 
to damage. However, victims of the spell may still believe they have been wounded and must 
succeed in opposed rolls of Resilience versus the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) in order to avoid 
the (psychosomatic) effects of receiving a Serious or Major Wound, even though they have not 
suffered any actual harm.

Protective Ward
Autonomous

This  spell  requires  the  use  of  the  Combine  manipulation.  It  must  be  coupled  with  Damage 
Resistance, Spell Resistance, Spirit Resistance or any combination of these three spells. When 
completed, the Protective Ward creates an area of protection of up to one metre radius per 10% 
of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. Casting the spell requires that the ward be inscribed into 
a solid surface, such as hard packed earth, stone flagstones or even a wooden deck of a ship. Once 
cast it cannot be moved, although the surface it is inscribed upon can be.

The Protective Ward’s perimeter contains the benefits of its combined Resistance spell(s). It only 
inhibits spells or attacks entering the circle from the outside – attacks or spells originating within 
the circle are unaffected. Thus a Protective Circle against spirits would block out external spirits 

186.204.39.123

203

but have no effect on those already inside its perimeter. A Protective Circle against damage or 
spells would block out incoming attacks/spells but have no effect on those attacks made within 
the sphere (including attacks targeting those outside the sphere).

Diverse versions of this spell are known which rely upon different geometries (circles, triangles 
and so on) or runes.

Project (Sense)
Concentration

Each ‘Project (Sense)’ is an individual spell, specific to one of the five primary senses but there are 
also variants for unusual sensory mechanisms, such as Darksense. The spell allows the sorcerer 
to project one of the recipient’s senses beyond his body via an invisible and intangible receptor, 
which transmits the specified type of sensory input back. This permits the recipient to use his 
Perception skill (with that sense) anywhere the receptor is.

The sorcerer decides at the time the spell is cast where the receptor initially manifests – either beside 
the spell’s recipient or a location well known to the sorcerer within the spell’s range. The receptor 
has a Movement of one metre per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. Concentration is 
only required to move the receptor – when stationary, the spell is treated as Autonomous instead.

A sorcerer can use Project (Sense) to be able to aim a second spell at a target who is out of direct 
observation – whether because of distance or blocking obstacles. The piggy-backed spell must 
also have sufficient Range to reach the target.

Project  (Sense)  can  be  detected  by  those  using  magical  perception  and,  if  desired,  dispelled. 
Attacking the receptor with a magically augmented weapon or a spell, will transfer the magical 
damage/effect back to the recipient.

Regenerate
Concentration

This spell functions much like the Divine Magic spells of Heal Wound and Regrow Limb, in that 
it will repair Serious or Major Wounds, even allowing a severed or maimed limb to be reattached 
or grow anew. The sorcerer may rejuvenate locations with a maximum of one Hit Point per 10% 
of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. This spell cannot raise an Adventurer from death.

Regenerate heals a damaged location back to one Hit Point (and no more), requiring the sorcerer 
to concentrate for a period of one entire round per HP recovered. Locations which have been 
severed and cannot be reattached take one minute per HP healed to regenerate. 

Restoration
Concentration

One  of  the  few  methods  known  of  healing  Characteristic  damage,  such  as  that  caused  by 
the Tap spell, Restoration works in a similar manner to Regenerate. The sorcerer may restore 
Characteristics  of  up  to  three  points  per  10%  of  the  caster’s  Sorcery  (Grimoire)  skill.  If  the 
original value of the Characteristic was higher than this, then it cannot be healed. Each point 
restored takes one minute to regenerate. 

204
186.204.39.123

Sense (Object or Substance)
Concentration

Eminently useful for finding valuables, lost possessions or hidden objects from afar, this 
spell has a variant for every substance imaginable. Sense (Substance) causes all sources of 
that  substance  within  range  of  the  spell  to  resonate  to  the  caster’s  dominant  sense.  For 
example,  diamonds  may  visibly  gleam  like  ice;  amber  could  taste  like  cinnamon;  water 
tinkle with a crystalline chime and so on. Whilst the spell can be cast over extreme ranges, 
it has difficulty detecting substances concealed or blanketed behind significant layers of 
solid material. The spell can penetrate a combined thickness of up to one metre of wood/
earth/rock/water, or one centimetre of metal per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) 
skill. For example, if a sorcerer is seeking a hidden hoard of gold in a castle, his Sorcery 
skill’s value must be able to penetrate the combined thicknesses of all the walls between 
him and the treasure.

Although each Sense spell is specific to particular objects or substances, the categories can be 
quite broad. For instance: gems, flesh and bones, metals, weapons, cult specific artefacts or even 
chaos.

Shapechange (Species) to (Species)
Autonomous, Resist (Resilience)

Shapechange morphs the shape and form of a target from one species to another. A sorcerer 
can affect, in total, up to three points of SIZ per 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire). The SIZ of 
the original form, added to the difference in SIZ between the original and modified form, must 
be  within  this  range. The  target  acquires  the  average  physical  (STR,  CON,  SIZ  and  DEX) 
Characteristics of the creature assumed, plus whatever natural attacks and modes of locomotion 
it possesses. If the caster has a superior skill than the new form, he may substitute his own in 
preference.

For example, a sorcerer of SIZ 10 who wishes to change into a brown bear (average SIZ 25), 
requires a minimum Sorcery (Grimoire) of 81%. Whereas if the same sorcerer wished to turn 
into a dog (average SIZ 3), he would only need a Sorcery (Grimoire) skill of 51%.

Each Shapechange variant is a separate spell. However, each species is quite broad in scope, 
covering  an  entire  family  of  a  type  of  creature.  For  example:  felines,  canines,  bears,  fish, 
snakes and so on. The spell only works on living things – the dead or inanimate cannot be 
shapechanged.

Smother
Autonomous, Resist (Resilience)

A sorcerer may cast Smother on a target of up to 3 SIZ per 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. 
If  he  fails  to  resist  he  begins  to  asphyxiate,  immediately  suffering  damage  at  the  start  of  the 
following Combat Round and continues to suffocate for the duration of the spell.

This spell can also be used to extinguish fires, as the flames will be starved of oxygen. In this case 
the sorcerer can affect up to three cubic metres of flames per 10% of Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.

186.204.39.123

205

186.204.39.123

Spell Resistance
Autonomous

A magical ward that blocks any incoming spell of up to 1 Magnitude per 10% of the caster’s 
Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.

Spell Resistance remains in place for the entirety of its duration – spells that successfully breach 
the Spell Resistance do not dispel it. However, it does not discriminate between incoming spells 
– a comrade attempting to magically heal the recipient of Spell Resistance must overcome it in 
order to successfully use a healing spell.

Spirit Resistance
Autonomous

This spell blocks spirits or otherworld entities of up to 3 POW per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery 
(Grimoire) skill, from coming into contact with the recipient. A blocked spirit unable to touch a 
recipient will not be able to personally attack or harm him, or engage him in spirit combat. Spells 
cast at the recipient by a spirit or otherworld entity, are likewise blocked unless their Magnitude 
exceeds the Magnitude of the Spirit Resistance.

Tap (Characteristic)
Concentration, Resist (Persistence)

Each  Characteristic  has  a  Tap  spell;  thus  Tap  (Strength),  Tap  (Constitution)  and  so  on. 
These devastating spells allow the caster to permanently strip a target of Characteristic points, 
transforming the tapped Characteristic points into Magic Points for his own use. It works only 
on creatures possessing the Characteristic being tapped. It is possible for a sorcerer to Tap his 
own Characteristics… but that is truly the act of a desperate sorcerer.

The Characteristics of targeted creatures can be reduced to a minimum of 1. However, Tap only 
consumes and transfers one point per round, making it less versatile in combat. Characteristic 
points  lost  to Tap  are  destroyed  permanently,  though  the  victim  can  regain  them  via  certain 
healing magic, or by raising them through the normal means of increasing a Characteristic.

A Characteristic may be tapped for up to one point per 10% of the sorcerer’s Sorcery (Grimoire) 
skill, from which the sorcerer gains an equivalent number of Magic Points. The sorcerer can only 
increase his Magic Points to double his normal maximum, although he may simply Tap a target 
and dissipate any excess – a truly malicious use of the spell. All Magic Points above his normal 
maximum gained through Tap disappear once the spell expires. 

Note that creatures affected by Tap (SIZ) become wasted and skeletal, rather than shrinking as 
they do with the Diminish spell.

There are reputed to be exotic and very rare versions of the Tap spell that consume other aspects 
of a victim, such as Tap (Youth), Tap (Emotion), Tap (Memory) and so forth. Without exception, 
these are regarded with even more loathing and hatred than the more common Tap spell!

186.204.39.123

207

Treat Wounds
Concentration

This spell dramatically accelerates the natural healing rate of the target. It heals up to one 
Hit Point per 10% of the caster’s Sorcery (Grimoire) skill, at the end of each round. The 
amount healed can be divided across multiple locations as the recipient desires. However, 
the healing does not affect Serious or Major Wounds, which require the Regenerate spell 
instead. 

Telepathy
Autonomous, Resist (Persistence)

The telepathy spell allows a sorcerer to not only mentally communicate with the target but also 
receive its sensory perceptions as well. If this is undesired the target may resist the spell. The 
caster can establish a link with creatures of up to 3 INT per 10% of his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. 
The more skilful the sorcerer, the better able he is to penetrate the mental complexities of more 
intelligent creatures. If sub-sentient such as in the case of an animal, the sorcerer gains limited 
comprehension in terms of feelings – but can still communicate. 

Teleport
Concentration, Resist (Evade)

Teleport  allows  a  sorcerer  to  instantaneously  move  himself,  or  a  target  to  anywhere 
within the range of the spell, as long as the destination is in direct observation, there is 
solid footing and no object bars their arrival. If these conditions are not met, the spell 
automatically fails. The caster is able to teleport objects up to 3 points of SIZ per 10% of 
his Sorcery (Grimoire) skill. 

Wrack
Concentration, Resist (Resilience)

This spell injures victims by wracking them with magical force. If the target fails to resist, every 
Combat Action the sorcerer can inflict a random location with an amount of damage according 
to their Sorcery (Grimoire) skill.

1–20% 1D2 damage, 21–40% 1D4, 41–60% 1D6, 61–80% 1D8, 81–100% 1D10, 101–120% 
2D6, 121–140% 1D6+1D8, 141–160% 2D8 and so on. 

Armour  provides  no  protection  but  magical  defences  (such  as  Countermagic  Shield  or  Spell 
Resistance) reduce rolled damage by the Magnitude they normally block (assuming the Wrack 
spell penetrates).

There are many versions of this spell that afflict the victim with different torments.  For 
example  one  form  of  Wrack  (Darkness)    slowly  freezes  the  target  with  frigid  tendrils  of 
shadow, whereas  another might cause their limbs to crack and shatter  or simply inflict an 
agonising poison.

208
186.204.39.123

guilds, factions and cults

In Legend, few Adventurers stand alone. Most are members of some faction, order or cult. Guilds 
are the guardians of secret knowledge and craftsmanship, and often have a commercial focus 
coupled with their spiritual or social aspects. Magical orders pass on the secrets of sorcery to the 
next generation of apprentices and jealously protect their grimoires and hidden lore. Factions 
can be anything from an order of chivalrous knights to a gang of thieves, while cults range from 
established religions to fringe cults to spirit-worshipping lodges. Ultimately, what a faction calls 
itself is unimportant – what matters is belief and loyalty.

Why Join a Faction?

Adventurers join factions for many reasons but the most common are:

•	 Cultural  influence:  all  members  of  a  particular  clan  worship  a  particular  god  and  it  has 

•	

always been thus. Faction membership is not just expected but mandatory.
Social advancement: membership of a particular guild or order is required to master a craft 
or a form of sorcery.

•	 Reinforce beliefs and behaviours: faction members cleave to a particular ideal or way of 

•	

behaving and, in the faction, find a way of both expressing it and being rewarded for it.
Power,  Glory  and  Status:  Rising  through  the  faction’s  ranks  brings  magical  power,  as 
explored earlier in Divine Magic but aside from that, factions offer rewards in the form of 
training and, perhaps, other gifts.

 
Cults 
A cult is any body of people who come together in veneration of a common symbol. This could be a 
god, a spirit or ancestor, an ideal or even a heroic personality. Cults fulfil many purposes: protection, 
progress and tuition, enlightenment and very often they are the focus for a complete community.

Where divine cults are concerned, a god may have several cults dedicated to different aspects of 
the god’s personality. Thus a single god may have many cults or just one, embracing all aspects 
of the god’s nature.

Cults are not limited to gods or spirits: a cult can form around a hero or heroine or even around 
a religious or philosophical ideal.

Guilds
Guilds are associations of those who practice a particular profession or craft. All the jewellers in 
a city might belong to the jeweller’s guild, all the blacksmiths to the blacksmith’s guild and so 
forth. Each guild possesses certain secret techniques and methods that are revealed only to those 
who prove themselves worthy to learn them.

186.204.39.123

209

Guilds wield vast political and economic power. Any craftsman or merchant who tries to operate 
without guild sanction will be shunned and driven out of business by the guild. Guildmasters 
have as much influence as any lord or high priest. Many long-established guilds take a mystical 
approach to their craft or profession, worshipping gods or spirits associated with the craft and 
practicing magical techniques.

Not all guilds are publicly known or tolerated – thieves, mercenaries or assassins may also form 
secret underworld guilds. 

Sorcerous Orders
Sorcerous orders are gatherings of sorcerers and scholars. Learning the art of Sorcery takes many 
years of hard study, so sorcery is usually passed from master to a small handful of dedicated 
apprentices.  Sorcerous  orders  are  largely  defined  by  the  grimoires  they  possess  –  the  most 
powerful orders have an extensive library of occult books. Such a library might contain as many 
as five or six unique grimoires, together with hundreds of commentaries, glosses, histories and 
related books of lore. 

Unlike  guilds,  most  sorcerous  orders  exist  on  the  fringes  of  society.  Sorcerers  bend  the  laws 
of reality and summon up ghastly horrors from beyond the stars, so they are often feared and 
abhorred by right-thinking folk.

Martial Orders 
Brave martial orders may be dedicated to a particular kingdom, or a deity, or an ideal. Membership 
of a chivalrous order is the dream of every noble warrior and squire but not all martial orders are 
made up of knights in shining armour. A martial order can also be a monastery of fighting monks 
on a distant mountain, or a band of hard-bitten mercenaries. Martial orders may control vast 
territories and great castles, and be possessed of considerable wealth and political power. Some 
orders even have divine blessings or secret fighting techniques. 

Factions and Magic

The kinds of magic offered vary depending on the faction’s nature.

Divine Cults offer Divine Magic and Common Magic to their members. Divine cults have, as 
their focus, a god or a pantheon of gods – beings of Divine power who, through a relationship 
with their faithful, extend both their magic and Characteristics to the membership.

Sorcerous Orders may have a god or a particular personality as the object of veneration but the 
order itself does not derive its magic from a Divine source, as would a Divine cult. Rather the 
order derives its magical power from the direct study of Sorcery, formulating grimoires reflecting 
the needs, deeds and myths of its object of veneration. Membership of Sorcerous Order gives 
access to one or more of the order’s Grimoires.

Guilds control access to the highest secrets of a particular craft or profession. An Adventurer 
who seeks a master capable of teaching the higher levels (75%) of a skill may be required to join 
the appropriate guild. Some guilds teach Common Magic related to that guild’s specialty – for 
example, a guild of blacksmiths might teach Bladesharp, Repair and Armoursmith’s Boon, while 
a guild of thieves might teach Bandit’s Cloak and Abacus.

210
186.204.39.123

Martial Orders may teach Common or Divine Magic, depending on their approach to combat. 
They often also possess special Heroic Abilities that are available only to their members. 

Comparative Rank Titles
Although  the  different  factions  have,  for  the  sake  of  simplicity,  the  same  structure  of  ranks, 
the names given to each rank differ between faction types. The Comparative Rank Titles table

Ranks

Part of the cult framework is to determine what ranks are available and how Adventurers progress 
from one to another. The core rank structure is summarised here, along with the advancement 
requirements and appropriate benefits. If the cult has any specific duties that members must 
perform, they will be outlined in the description of the rank.

Level 0: Common Members
The first step in joining a faction and rising through its ranks is to become a Common Member. 
An Adventurer can belong to several factions as a Common Member, as long as they are not 
diametrically opposed. The vast majority of members of a faction are Common Members, casual 
follows who support and aid the faction.

Level 1: Initiated Members
This is the start of the inner membership of the faction and Initiated Members have to donate 
a substantial amount of time and money to the organisation. In return, they receive benefits 
denied to Common Members. It is possible for an Adventurer to be an Initiated Member of 
more than one faction at a time.

Level 2: Fervent Members
Few members of the faction will rise to the position of Fervent Member, a rank that requires 
dedication and service but where the inner secrets of the faction begin to be revealed. Fervent 
Members can be Common Members and even Initiated Members of other factions but cannot 
be Fervent Members of more than one faction.

186.204.39.123

211

Level 3: Masters
Masters are the respected and established leaders of the faction and have full command of the 
faction’s secret skills or spells. There is usually only a single master in a given gathering of the 
faction. 

Level 4: Grand Masters
The leaders of the cult, Grand Masters embody everything the faction stands for and have access 
to  its  deepest  secrets. When  trouble  threatens,  it  is  the  Grand  Masters  who  will  fight  for  its 
survival and prosperity.

service for the faction.
Candidates will be tested to determine their 
knowledge of the faction, their sincerity for 
joining and even their current reputation. 
The Adventurer must know five of the 
faction skills. Initiated members may also be 
required to donate some of their income to 
the faction.
 

Fervent 
Members

Masters

Candidates must have been an Initiated 
Member of the faction for at least two years 
and must have at least five faction skills of at 
least 50%. A valuable gift must be made to 
the faction, in accordance with its tenets and 
its status. For example, in a guild, the Fervent 
Member must complete a masterwork and 
present it to the masters; in a martial order, 
the would-be knight must complete a quest. 
Candidates must have been a Fervent 
Member of the faction for at least two years 
and must have at least five cult skills of at 
least 75%.

Grand 
Masters

Candidates must have been a Master of the 
cult for at least three years and must have at 
least five cult skills of at least 90%.

Benefits
The Adventurer will automatically be 
able to find tutors for any skills the 
cult teaches. They must still pay the 
normal rates for these services. 
As well as all the benefits enjoyed by 
Common Members, the Initiated 
Member will have automatic access 
to Common Magic spells (those only 
taught by their cult). Pious Members 
pay half the normal price for being 
taught faction skills. 

If an Adventurer is an Initiated 
Member of a faction, he will usually 
be considered a Common Member 
of all allied factions without being 
required to make any donation.
Fervent Members may call for Divine 
Intervention.

Faction skills are learnt for free.

Moreover, Masters have the resources 
of their entire following at their 
disposal though they are advised not 
to abuse the trust of the faction’s 
members.
Faction skills are learnt for free.

Common Magic
Factions can offer Common Magic. The range of Common Magic available may be far wider 
than its Divine, Spirit or Sorcery Magic portfolio; or be limited to a handful of spells the faction 
finds especially useful. It is therefore not uncommon to see a faction listed as providing ‘All’ 
Common  Magic  spells  –  meaning  all  the  spells  found  in  Legend’s  Common  Magic  chapter. 
Similarly some factions may only provide a list of named spells – or may have special Common 
Magic spells of their own development.

Divine Magic
The god a faction worships determines what Divine Magic is offered. A war god, for example, 
can be expected to have Divine Spells relating to combat and battle; whereas a fertility goddess 
can be expected to have spells related with healing and growth. Again, there are no hard and fast 
rules here, save the description of the cult and the nature of the deity. 

The number of Divine Spells a cult offers depends on the cult’s size and standing. However most 
cults will offer around four or five Divine Spells to Pious Members or above.

Sorcery
Those orders following a sorcerous tradition may have an ideal or philosophy as the focus of 
veneration,  or  a  particular  god,  demi-god  or  saint. The  Sorcery  spells  offered  are  collectively 
known  as  a  grimoire  and  order  members  have  access  to  the  order’s  grimoire  or  grimoires  as 
described in the Sorcery chapter.

Faction Skills
These  are  skills  mastered  by  the  cult  and  considered  important  to  it. Training  in  these  skills 
is  more  or  less  guaranteed  with  faction  members  being  able  to  find  access  to  a  teacher  via  a 
temple, academy, school, shrine or through faction contacts. Faction skills are usually trained at 
a discount and if so this will be mentioned in the faction’s description.

Additionally  increasing  competence  in  faction  skills  is  usually  mandatory  for  Adventurers  to 
progress from one rank to the next. Thus, when considering training and spending Improvement 
Rolls, Adventurers need to consider and then balance-up, faction advancement requirements.

Sample Cults

Three cults are presented here as examples.

The Cult of the Thunderer (Divine Cult)
The warrior-god of the forest-tribes is the Thunderer, who shakes the branches and drives back 
the darkness. The forest tribes learned to worship the Thunderer and the rest of their pantheon 
from the sea-going barbarians of the north; in the mountains of the north, the Thunderer is 
associated with a magic iron hammer but the forest tribes have few ironsmiths. In their rites, 
therefore, the Thunderer’s holy weapon is the spear, which symbolises his heavenly thunderbolts.

Warriors  of  the Thunderer  are  honour-bound  to  defend  the  tribe  and  hunt  down  monsters. 
Storms are their sacred time and battles or ceremonies conducted amid the thunder and the 
howling rain are especially blessed.

Divine Magic: Blessing (any Cult Skill), Crash of Thunder, Lightning Strike, Shield, Channel Strength.

Order of the Black Serpent (Sorcery Order)
The Order of the Black Serpent follows the teachings of Menakhem Ka, the insane demi-god of 
the Ziggurat of the Eclipse. His desire to become a true god was articulated in his blasphemous 
grimoire before he departed into the depths of the great desert.

Since then, the order has swollen in size from the original eight disciples and now numbers some

Guild of Assassins

Go down a certain street in a certain desert town and knock on the white door. An old man 
will greet you, offer you mint tea, and talk with you for a time. Tell him your woes and your 
troubles, and describe to him certain individuals who have caused you distress. He will listen 
to you, saying nothing, perhaps even seeming to sleep but when you get up to leave, the old 
man will hand you a pebble. If it is black, then nothing more will happen but if it is white, 
those troublesome individuals will die – and the old man will find you, someday, and demand 
payment for these deaths.

186.204.39.123

215

The Assassin’s Guild are not a band of hired thugs or murderers. They are adjusters on the scales 
of life, weighing one man’s virtues against another. Would the city be better off if the young 
prince ruled instead of the old king? Which priestess should lead the temple? They only kill if 
their victim deserves death according to their cryptic methodology.

At the lower ranks of the guild, the Assassins are willing to employ thieves, rogues and Adventurers 
as assassins; however, only those dedicated to the cause of death may ascend to the higher ranks. 

Common  Magic:  Bandit’s  Cloak,  Boon  of  Lasting  Night,  Coordination,  Detect  Enemy,  
Mindspeech, Hand of Death

Heroic Abilities: Dead Eye, Severing Slash, Wall Leaping

Alaric’s Tale – Cult of the Thunderer
Alaric dwells in the Gloamwood amid barbaric tribes.

At the age of 21 all warriors of the tribe are expected to become initiates of the Thunderer cult 
and Alaric is no exception. On his 21st birthday he is taken into the tribe’s most sacred shrine 
where he must undergo certain testing rituals – of his courage, his magic and his understanding 
of the Thunderer.

The  cult  skills  are  Spear  fighting,  Lore  (The  Thunderer),  Evade,  Perception  and  Common 
Magic. Alaric has each of these skills at more than 30% and so passes the tests involving his skills.

Next is his commitment to the cult: this is sealed through Alaric establishing a Pact with the 
Thunderer. In a deeply mystical ceremony Alaric is tested with fire and words and, in the final 
act, ascends the bare hill above the shrine to stand and glory in the full force of an oncoming 
storm. This rite creates the Pact (the Thunderer) and Alaric’s player enters this onto his character 
sheet. Alaric dedicates 4 POW to the Pact, making his Pact (The Thunderer) 14% (CHA + 4 
dedicated POW). He is now an initiate of the cult and bound by its teachings.

The benefits Alaric derives from his cult are as follows:

•	 Alaric can learn the cult’s Divine Magic spells and cast them at Lore (The Thunderer) 52%. 
The inherent Magnitude for any Divine Spell he casts is equal to his Pact divided by 10 and 
rounded up, so Alaric’s Divine Spells will have a Magnitude of 2. As his Pact deepens, so will 
the potency of his Divine Magic. He can also pray for up to four Divine Spells – the amount 
of his POW dedication. Alaric learns, through his initiation and later progress in the cult, 
Lightning Strike, Shield, Bless (Spear & Shield) and Channel Strength. 

•	 He can gain access to training in the cult’s skills at a much reduced cost with dedicated 
teachers. The cult also specialises in several Common Magic spells, which again Alaric can 
learn at reduced cost and with dedicated teachers.

•	 Most importantly, Alaric has the support of the entire cult behind him. As an Initiate he 
will be expected to work long and hard for the cult but in return he will be able to call 
upon colleagues and fellow cultists for help or advice. Furthermore, initiation into the cult 
marks Alaric as a warrior within the tribe and this is a moment of great pride for the young 
Adventurer.

heroic abilities

What separates a hero from an Adventurer?

Actions,  deeds,  reputation  and  history,  obviously,  but  in  some  cases  a  hero  is  defined  by  his 
capabilities. A lucky few demonstrate innate talents that distinguish them from the rank and file. 
These talents and capabilities are known as Heroic Abilities.

Heroic  Abilities  are  powers  and  enhancements  available  through  seeking  reclusive  masters, 
HeroQuesting supernatural gifts, divine blessings or progression within a cult. Adventurers gain 
these abilities, which augment their existing skills and magic, as rewards for heroic aspirations 
and actions.

Gaining a Heroic Ability is not as simple as training in a skill or buying a spell. Heroic Abilities 
need to be earned and usually in one of the following ways:

•	 Attaining a certain rank, usually Level 3 or Level 4, in a faction.
•	 Undertaking epic or heroic quests, either as part of cult business or some other endeavour 

•	

decided by the Games Master.
Studying  with  another  hero  –  learning  from  them,  emulating  them  and,  eventually, 
developing a similar technique.

At  their  simplest,  Heroic  Abilities  are  gained  once  an  Adventurer  has  accrued  enough  Hero 
Points to buy one. However, this should never be the sole criteria for gaining a Heroic Ability. 
Games Masters should bear in mind that a Heroic Ability is not a piece of merchandise that an 
Adventurer can pick up at the market after accumulating enough ‘money’ in the form of Hero 
Points. These are rare and wonderful abilities, not merely an ‘Adventurer sheet upgrade’. In order 
to learn these abilities, an Adventurer must have proved himself heroically and not simply on 
a one-off endeavour. True heroes continue to live up to their reputations and are prepared to 
undergo countless hazards with a more or less selfless outlook. 

Thus,  although  an  Adventurer  might  reach  the  rank  of,  say,  Priest  in  a  church  and  thereby 
become eligible for a Heroic Ability (if his cult offers them) he is not necessarily entitled to add 
it to his Adventurer sheet. The Games Master may very well require the Adventurer to earn the 
Heroic Ability through a specific scenario or further adventure.

On some occasions Adventurers will encounter heroes who already have Heroic Abilities and 
seek to learn from this master. This is permissible of course but no self respecting hero will ever 
gladly, easily or freely impart knowledge and expertise that he has spent years earning unless 
the prospective pupil demonstrates his own worth. Even though a student wanting to learn 
a Heroic Ability might have the right amount of Hero Points to spend, the Games Master is 
fully within his rights to insist on the Adventurer proving himself in some fashion before the 
Heroic Ability is taught.

218
186.204.39.123

Using Heroic Abilities

The description of the ability indicates how it is used in game play. However, invoking a Heroic 
Ability  always  costs  the  Adventurer  one  Magic  Point  whenever  it  is  used.  Although  Heroic 
Abilities  are  not  magical  powers,  they  are,  to  some  extent,  fuelled  by  the  same  reserves  that 
power Common Magic. Invoking a Heroic Ability involves delving into one’s own character, 
channelling the intangible forces that fire deeds of heroism. 

To invoke a Heroic Ability no Skill Test is needed; simply the spending of one Magic Point and 
the clear statement of the ability to be used in advance of any Skill Test it applies to.

The duration of the ability is given in its description and at the end of the ability’s duration, its 
effects end. The Adventurer can invoke the ability again immediately afterwards, as long as he 
has the Magic Points to do so and as long as the ability’s effects do not leave him incapacitated 
(through fatigue, for instance).

Heroic Abilities Described
Arrow Cutting
Requirements: DEX 15 or higher, any Close Combat Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: A number of melee rounds equal to CON

Your  reactions  are  preternatural,  allowing  you  to  parry  missile  attacks  with  melee  weapons 
instead of being limited to a shield.

Awesome Smash
Requirements: STR 15 or higher, any unarmed or bludgeon Weapon Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 12
Duration: One melee attack

Invoked  whilst  wielding  a  bludgeoning  weapon  or  using  Unarmed  combat,  you  cause  an 
automatic  knockback  of    one  metre  per  two  points  of  rolled  damage  before  it  is  reduced  by 
parrying, armour or magic. If the victim strikes any obstacle they smash into it, fall prone and 
automatically receive the attacker’s Damage Bonus to a random location, ignoring any protection.

Battle Fury
Requirements: CON 15 or higher, any Close Combat Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 12
Duration: A number of melee rounds equal to CON

You are a terrible foe on the battlefield, as fearsome and unstoppable as a raging wild boar. You 
can enter a Battle Fury as a Combat Action. While in a Battle Fury, you automatically succeed 
in any Resilience roll required for sustaining a Serious or Major Wound. You also automatically 
succeed in any Persistence roll when resisting mental or emotional attacks. Upon leaving Battle 
Fury, you automatically gain three levels of Fatigue.

186.204.39.123

219

Born to the Saddle
Requirements: POW 15 or higher, Riding 90% or higher
Hero Points: 8
Duration: Until the terrain or situation has been cleared, or if in combat, a number of melee 
rounds equal to CON

Sitting in the saddle is more natural to you than walking. Each time this ability is invoked you 
may ignore any and all riding based situational modifiers for terrain or the mount’s behaviour. 
In addition you may use your Riding skill instead of your Evade skill when evading missiles.

Dead Eye
Requirements: DEX 15 or higher, any ranged Weapon skill at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One missile attack

Your accuracy with either thrown or projected missile weapons (whichever type you have mastery 
in) is the stuff of legends. Invoking this ability allows you to increase the range of your chosen 
type of missile weapons by 50% and if you successfully hit you may automatically select the 
location struck – permitting you to bypass the effects of anything less than total cover.

Defiant Leap
Requirements: STR 15 or higher, Athletics 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One extraordinary jump

You are able to defy gravity when performing a single vertical or horizontal jump. You may roll 
your Damage Bonus and add this value in metres to the distance achieved.

Deflecting Parry
Requirements: DEX 15 or higher, any Close Combat Weapon Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One parry

You may increase the size of your parrying weapon or shield by two steps for a single parry. This 
might allow an unarmed defender to ward off a halberd, or the user of a buckler to deflect a 
mounted lance attack.

Disease Immunity
Requirements: CON 15 or higher, Resilience 70% or higher
Hero Points: 8
Duration: Continuous – body automatically burns 1 Magic Point when it is infected

You  are  immune  to  all  normal  diseases.  Each  time  you  are  exposed  to  a  disease,  your  body 
unconsciously invokes this ability and purges the infection. Magical diseases will still affect you, 
though you gain a +20% bonus to tests to resist them.

220
186.204.39.123

Duellist
Requirements: DEX 15 or higher, any 1H Combat Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One melee round

Mastery of your chosen duelling weapon allows you, for brief moments, to react with blinding 
speed. As a free act you can invoke this ability to grant yourself a single extra Combat Action for 
that round. This extra CA may only be used for attacks or parries.

Empathic Wound
Requirements: POW 15 or higher, Influence skill at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One injury
 
One of the more unusual of the Heroic Abilities, Empathic Wound is a dangerous and taxing 
ability and is normally only used by those who shun or forswear violence. When invoked, any 
damage  you  suffer  from  being  harmed  is  mirrored  upon  your  attacker,  whether  it  be  from 
torture, stuck by a weapon, or targeted by a spell. Your inviolate sanctity causes the assailant to 
psychosomatically or mystically suffer the exact same effects of any damage caused to you.

Heroic Aura
Requirements: CHA 15 or higher, Influence skill at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 12
Duration: One melee round

Your presence is not only heartening to your comrades, you are also a shining example to others. 
You  may  take  a  Combat  Action  to  bolster  all  allies  within  your  CHA  in  metres  with  your 
presence, either gaining your CHA as a bonus to any Persistence or Resilience tests they are 
called upon to make, or as a bonus to all Combat Styles for the remainder of the Combat Round. 

Linguist
Requirements: INT 15 or higher, two Language skills (aside from your native tongue) at 50% 
or higher
Hero Points: 8
Duration: Several hours

Your study of languages has taught you the common roots of all tongues, allowing you to pick 
up new foreign languages with startling ease. Invoking this ability, you must either converse with 
a speaker of a strange language for one hour, or simply hear the language being spoken for two 
or more hours. You then automatically gain the Language skill in that language at its basic score. 
A successful Improvement roll when improving a Language skill doubles the skill points gained 
(roll 2D4+2 rather than 1D4+1). 

186.204.39.123

221

Loremaster
Requirements: INT 15 or higher, four Lore skills at 50% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One recall attempt

You are a font of knowledge, possessed of more learning than even you can readily remember. 
Any time you fail a Lore Skill Test, you are entitled to make an immediate Persistence test (with 
the same modifiers as the original Lore test) to see if you can recall some shred of knowledge 
relating to the subject at hand. Typically, this will reveal less information than a successful Lore 
test would have but it should still be enough to be of benefit to you.

Mighty Blow
Requirements: STR 15 or higher, any Close Combat Weapon Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One melee attack

You can increase the size of your weapon by two steps for a single attack. This helps the blow 
overwhelm any parry which intercepts it, allowing damage to penetrate.

Poison Immunity
Requirements: CON 15 or higher, Resilience 70% or higher
Hero Points: 8
Duration: Continuous – body automatically burns 1 Magic Point when it is poisoned

You are immune to all normal poisons. Each time you are poisoned, your body unconsciously 
invokes this ability and purges the toxin. Magical poisons will still affect you, though you gain a 
+20% bonus to tests to resist them.

Reincarnation
Requirements: POW 15 or higher, Pact, Sorcery (Grimoire) 90% or higher
Hero Points: 12
Duration: One Use

Upon death you are reincarnated as an animal or creature reflecting the runic affiliation or nature 
of your cult. Your physical Characteristics (STR, CON, SIZ and DEX) become those of the 
creature you are reborn into but your INT, POW and CHA remain those of the Adventurer. This 
Heroic Ability does not require a Magic Point to use. It can only be used once and it is gone.

222
186.204.39.123

Severing Slash
Requirements: DEX 15 or higher, any cutting Weapon Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One melee attack

If wielding a cutting weapon, you can maximise its damage for a single blow.

Sundering Strike
Requirements: STR 15 or higher, any Close Combat Weapon Style at 90% or higher
Hero Points: 12
Duration: One melee attack

You can smash or cleave an inanimate object with no harm to your weapon. Any damage you roll 
completely ignores the Armour Points of the object. Thus you could cut a chain, or smash a door 
with a single blow. If attacking an opponent’s weapon, you must succeed in the attack and equal 
or beat the opponent’s level of success to successfully strike the parrying object. 

Tireless
Requirements: CON 15 or higher, Athletics 90% or higher
Hero Points: 8
Duration: Special

Your stamina is Heroic, allowing you to continue fighting or working long after others drop from 
exhaustion. Each time you invoke this ability you reduce your Fatigue by one level.

Wall Leaping
Requirements: DEX 15 or higher, Acrobatics 90% or higher
Hero Points: 10
Duration: One round of running

Displaying incredible agility, you can run along or up walls for short distances to escape or gain 
a better position against an enemy. You may only use Wall Leaping if not Overloaded, Exhausted 
or  Debilitated. The  entirety  of  your  Movement  in  a  Combat  Round  may  be  made  along  a 
vertical surface, allowing you to bypass an obstruction that might otherwise block your path 
or even climb a wall at lightning speed. However, you cannot continue moving along a vertical 
surface from Combat Round to Combat Round – you must reach level ground (or a suitable 
perch) by the end of your last Combat Action in a round or fall.

gamesmastering legend

This  chapter  offers  specific  advice  to  Games  Masters,  both  novice  and  veteran,  on  running 
Legend and getting the most out of it. It includes specific advice regarding key themes in Legend, 
rules and guidance on a variety of situations likely to arise that may not necessarily be addressed 
by specific rules in the earlier chapters, plus some guidance on creating scenarios for Legend.

As  with  any  amount  of  guidance,  the  material  found  in  this  chapter  is  here  to  suggest  and 
prompt ideas and creativity: it is not intended to be prescriptive. A tenet to always bear in mind 
is ‘Forge Your Own Legend’, meaning that, as Games Master, how you choose to use these rules 
and how you want to develop your game should always take precedence. There are few rules in 
this book that cannot be modified in some way and  Games Masters are encouraged to tinker 
with, alter and ignore rules that do not fit their style of play or campaign objectives. 

Themes

One of the hallmarks of Legend is the way in which certain themes are handled, both as part of 
the rules and during game play. The mechanics of the system engender a certain style of play 
that emphasises Adventurer development, skill-use and an approach to the wider community 
above simply killing monsters, avoiding traps and accumulating treasure. Not that these things 
are unimportant or wrong; more that Legend places a different emphasis on adventuring. This 
section examines themes Games Masters may wish to keep in mind when developing scenarios 
for play and then running them with players.
Community
Community and relationships are integral to Legend. Adventurers do not exist in isolation; they 
have pasts, families, social and cultural groups they belong to or have belonged to and the rules 
encourage ongoing community interaction through the joining of cults.

The  rules  for  establishing  Cultural  Background  and  community  in  the  Adventurer  Creation 
chapter provide a template for Adventurers to establish certain things before play begins: where 
they come from, who their family is/was, who they know (friends and foes) and key things that 
have  influenced  their  lives. These  details  are  deliberately  vague  to  act  as  a  catalyst  for  players 
and  Games  Masters,  working  together,  to  build  interesting  portraits  of  Adventurers’  past  lives 
through  discussion,  conjecture  (‘what  if  my  long-lost  twin  brother  is  now  an  evil  sorcerer…?’) 
and, hopefully, exploration during play. Using the ideas provided by the Cultural Background and 
Community sections Adventurers become far more than a set of figures on an Adventurer sheet: 
they have a history, a context and, in many cases, a reason for being. Using the guidance on contacts 
and enemies provides a set of plot hooks for further development that keep Adventurers involved 
with their history. It is therefore worth investing some time in this part of the Adventurer Creation 
process to gain a deeper understanding of the Adventurer and how he might develop during play.

Another aspect of community that is worth exploring is continued attachment to it. In many 
roleplaying games the Adventurers are created and embark on their adventures with little or no 
thought for the communities that nurtured them. This is different in Legend. In many Legend 
settings Adventurers remain within their communities and continue to serve them. Such local 
heroics are a key principle of Legend play. Grand quests are certainly important and concern the 
Adventurers but often a scenario or set of scenarios focus on serving the daily requirements of the 

186.204.39.123

225

clan, tribe, village or town, with little financial reward as the incentive but the thanks and kudos 
afforded by the community when the Adventurers are successful. Many very successful Legend 
campaigns have concerned the daily lives of the Adventurers, with dangerous quests, epic battles 
and dour foes being introduced sporadically, reflecting the more likely nature of such events. 
As  the  Adventurers  serve  their  communities,  so  they  grow  with  them.  Relationships  deepen, 
their place in the community progresses and, eventually, those lowly Adventurers are chieftains, 
champions, lords and kings.
Magic
The availability of magic is reflected in the four magic systems presented in the Legend rules. In 
some settings, magic is ubiquitous with even the lowliest primitive having some magical charm 
that protects him or aids him in his life. Naturally not all fantasy settings rely on magic to such 
an extent and the rules are presented in a way to allow Games Masters to tailor the availability of 
magic to the campaign. Low magic settings, for instance, might only have Sorcery available as the 
magical system of the world and access to it restricted by culture or taboo. Similarly if the gods of a 
world are distant, uncaring beings, Divine Magic might be non-existent or, at best, extremely rare.

Thought therefore needs to be given to the availability of magic and this depends on the setting. 
Some examples follow.

•	

•	

In gritty, Sword and Sorcery settings, only sorcery – which is seen as a dark and malevolent 
force – is available and then only to the few who are prepared to undergo its corrupting 
influence to attain it. Most people are fearful of magic and attempt to limit their exposure 
to it, for fear of what it might do to their immortal souls.
In High Fantasy settings Divine Magic and Sorcery may be available but only to certain 
races, cults or orders. Common Magic is not something the general populace is exposed to 
but it is present and worked by those who use it as a gateway to more refined powers.

•	 Dark Fantasy settings, such as the Eternal Champion series, rely on magicians to be willing 
to bargain their very souls for magical power – although all kinds of magic are available to 
those willing to enter into such contracts. Magic is sinister, although not necessarily evil and 
Adventurers who use it are forever in jeopardy of losing their humanity as they use magic 
for whatever ends they have in mind.

Quests
Despite what has been said about community, Adventurers should find themselves engaged in 
quests  –  mundane  and  magical  –  for  either  the  thrill  of  the  adventure,  to  defeat  a  foe  or  to 
advance or protect their community’s interests. 

Magical Quests
Magical quests are a feature of Legend. Adventurers are likely to be engaged in magical quests in 
many ways, some of the most common being:

Finding a fabled treasure for the good of the community.

•	
•	 Aiding  a  sorcerer  or  other  magician  in  creating  a  magical  treasure  through  finding 

•	 Delving into a myth, dream or Otherworld experience, with a magical treasure or power 

components.

as the prize.

•	 Returning a magical treasure to its place of origin or a place of destruction, to avert doom 

of some form.
Seeking magical power to advance within a cult or for personal kudos/gain.

•	

Magical quests by their nature usually involve much risk – either in the form of protective magic, 
powerful guardians or the nature of the treasure/quest itself. This is the reason for carefully considering 
the place of magic in the setting. If magic is rare, then lower levels of magical threat might be employed 
as part of the quest: the Adventurers, being unfamiliar with magic largely, are likely to find any degree 
of magic daunting and need to counter it with mundane abilities, wits and ingenuity.

226
186.204.39.123

If magic is commonplace, then higher and deeper levels of magic are likely to be necessary and 
the backing of a cult or sorcerous order is a prime requisite in completing the quest successfully.

Whatever the basis, Legend is not a game that is littered with magical items to be found randomly 
as part of a treasure hoard. Magical items are treasured artefacts that are not lost or misplaced 
carelessly,  nor  packed  into  chests  and  trunks  along  with  a  stash  of  gold.  Magic  is  never  a 
commodity in Legend; it is a valuable resource and, as such, needs handling with care, especially 
in the case of magical items or the objects of magical quests. Magical quests tend to be focused 
affairs that have, at their heart, some measure of life-changing experience – even though the basic 
nature of the quest may appear to be mundane.
Factions
Guilds, factions and cults are an important part of Legend. Aside from the obvious advantages 
of access to magic, training and information, factions offer several benefits for Games Masters:

Faction membership offers a ready excuse for adventuring. Factions frequently need to defend 
themselves  against  enemy  or  rival  groups  and  frequently  engage  in  quests  of  many  kinds  to 
advance their knowledge, power and status. Even low-level faction members can be engaged on 
important faction business.

Factions provide an additional layer of community for Adventurers. Usually this will not be at 
odds with the Adventurers’ existing communities but, depending on the faction type, it may 
offer an interesting conflict leading to interesting, faction versus community stories.

Through factions, the gods and other foci of cult veneration become real and visceral things, 
driving and shaping behaviour and destinies. Factions lend purpose and drive to Adventurers 
and adventures. Simply joining a faction and being initiated into its ways can form the focus of 
several sessions of storytelling.

Of course factions need not play such a large part in a Legend game but their unique place in the 
central heart of Legend makes them a natural – and very important – mechanism for developing 
adventures that can break away from the usual tropes of fantasy fiction and roleplaying games. 
Factions have their own agendas and beliefs which, when explored, lend a satisfying depth to 
both character and social development.

Future Legend supplements will develop the factions available – both for specific settings and 
generically – allowing Games Masters to take full advantage of the diversity of factions.

A Good Story, Well Told

Legend is concerned very much with both storytelling and Adventurer development. The game 
mechanics for Legend, whilst being comprehensive and sophisticated, are intuitive enough to 
fade into the background of the game, intruding only when necessary to resolve a particular 
outcome. Indeed, Legend’s mechanics should be part of the background as much as possible. 
Everything, mechanically, that is needed for Legend, is contained on the Adventurer sheet: skill 
values, Hit Points, weapon statistics and so forth. Whilst the Games Master will inevitably need 
to refer to the rules during play, most questions can be resolved by consulting the Adventurer 
sheet and rolling 1D100 or 1D20.

What this means is that the game session can focus on developing a Good Story, Well Told. The 
game mechanics do not drive the story: the Adventurers do – and the bulk of the rules found 
in Legend are geared towards investment in the Adventurer: Characteristics, Attributes, Skills, 
Combat Styles, Magic and Cult details, each element is designed to invest in the Adventurer 
– not the player, Games Master or even the concepts of the game – and enable Adventurers to 
shine through as individuals, supported by elements that develop them as part of a group or team 
(community, once again). How well Adventurers develop along with the investments the game 

186.204.39.123

227

system makes depends very much on the players but in Legend the rules are designed to work 
with and for the Adventurers, aiding imagination, providing opportunity and diversity, rather 
than reducing either to a series of available or not available, on/off abilities and options.

For the Games Master this theme of storytelling and Adventurer focus means that it is worthwhile 
spending time with the players and taking an interest in how their Adventurers are created. Some 
tips to consider are:

•	

•	 Help  players  develop  the  community  section  of  Adventurer  Creation.  Have  in  mind  a 
common theme that all players can subscribe to and assist in developing close Adventurer 
relationships early-on. This establishes a sense of fraternity amongst the players and develops 
instant bonds before play begins.
Introduce factions and faction membership reasonably early. Cults are not something to be 
withheld until Adventurers reach a certain level; they exist to get Adventurers to a certain 
level. And, because factions in many settings for Legend are all around, it makes sense that 
faction membership will come sooner rather than later.
Encourage players to think about their skills when coming to make Improvement Rolls. 
It is natural to focus on skills for combat and magic but social and knowledge skills are 
equally important. Try to encourage diversity amongst the players but have them think ‘in 
character’ when choosing which skills to improve. Would a new initiate of a faction really 
seek  to  improve  non-faction  skills  or  would  he,  perhaps,  focus  on  those  skills  that  will 
help him gain status in the faction and prove his loyalty? Looking at these mechanics from 
a  slightly  different,  Adventurer-driven  perspective  contributes  to  developing  diverse  and 
believable Adventurers.

Campaigns and Scenarios

A scenario is a story, played through in one or several sessions of play. A campaign is a linked set 
of stories that may or may not have a definite conclusion. One way to differentiate between the 
two is to consider scenarios as short stories or chapters of a novel and a campaign as an anthology 
of short stories or as the novel itself (or trilogy of novels, if the campaign is of a grand scale). 
Campaigns may take months or years to complete – and some are ongoing sagas, reflecting the 
lives of the Adventurers.

The  Games  Master  is  responsible  for  presenting  the  scenario  and  campaign  to  the  players. 
Scenarios tend to fall into one of the following categories:

Published – A pre-written Legend scenario offered for sale or download, either as a one-off adventure 
or a complete campaign. Published scenarios take a great deal of the preparatory work out of the 
Games Master’s workload allowing play to begin swiftly. However, Games Masters still need to be 
familiar with the scenario’s content, structure, themes and goals and it may be that the Games Master 
needs to adapt certain elements to fit with his existing campaign, play-style and so forth. If using a 
published scenario be prepared to adapt and change elements – perhaps substantial ones!

Home-Written  –  Here,  the  Games  Master  writes  the  scenario,  developing  the  plot,  the 
Adventurers  and  creatures  involved,  events,  encounters  and  so  forth.  Writing  scenarios  can 
be time-consuming but allows for the best fit of themes, play-style and plotting to fit with a 
campaign. The  restrictions  come  in  two  forms:  the  amount  of  detail  and  time  needed  to  be 
invested in the scenario and the likelihood that the players will want to make choices that fall 
outside of what the Games Master has planned. Even the most meticulously planned scenario 
can be sidelined by players who choose option C when the Games Master had only planned for 
options A and B. However, such diversions can often be the most entertaining (or frustrating) as 
the Games Master, forced to improvise, develops new and interesting plots that may complement 
or even replace those of the planned scenario. It is therefore quite often better to keep the details 
of a home-written scenario as loose and flexible as possible, making it easier to deal with the 
unexpected actions and decisions of the players.

228
186.204.39.123

Scenario Seeds – A kernel of an idea, often perhaps no longer than a paragraph or a sentence, is 
used as the basis of the adventure with the Games Master improvising the action and using stock, 
pre-generated or typical creature statistics, to support encounters. Handling a scenario seed is always 
a challenge since it requires the Games Master to think on his feet; however, the investment both 
players and Games Master make in the overall story may well turn out to be far more rewarding 
than if using a home-written or published scenario. This is improvisational story-telling at its best 
– although the Games Master’s level of experience is often the key to its success.

However, irrespective of the nature of the scenario, there are some guidelines that benefit every 
Games Master and these follow.
Campaign Planning
A campaign is a series of linked scenarios and can be as long or as short as one needs them to 
be. Some campaigns last years, charting the full lives of the same Adventurers. Others are more 
episodic, ending at an agreed point and picked up again after several years of game time have 
passed. In others, new Adventurers might be created to suit the style or theme of the campaign.

Whatever the campaign’s nature, it needs a style. The style is very much dependent on where the 
campaign is set, so setting, too, is of utmost importance.

Published settings do a great deal of the background work for the Games Master but may not 
be to everyone’s taste or style of play. Self-penned settings, whether historical or fantasy based, 
always require a great deal of work and research by the Games Master. Things to consider:

•	

•	 Historical or pure fantasy? If historical, then there is a wealth of material to draw upon, from 
encyclopaedias and text books through to historical settings from other game systems. The 
key thing will be to fit the Legend rules to the requirements of the setting, or be prepared 
to alter the historical context to accommodate the rules (magic is the prime consideration 
here: will your historical setting use magic and, if so, how is it rationalised and explained? 
How will it affect the nature of the world? 
If  you are  creating your own fantasy world, then you have  carte-blanche to create  what 
you want but remember that most successful and convincing fantasy worlds function to a 
certain set of rules that help make them work and feel real. It is also tempting – and can be 
a great deal of fun – to mix lots of different fantasy elements into a single setting (magic, 
Industrial Revolution machinery, giant robots and so on). If you do this, consider how each 
element impacts on its fellows. Also try to resist throwing too much into the mix at the 
beginning: this can prove overwhelming for the players who may not grasp the nature and 
concepts of the setting as easily as the creator.

Whatever the basis for the setting, be prepared to invest some time in its themes, coherence and 
the kinds of stories it will generate. Taking the time to prepare will help the campaign develop 
into something memorable rather than something that fizzles out after a few sessions of play.
Presenting the Scenario
As Games Master it is your task to present the scenario to the players. How you handle this is 
a matter of personal style; some Games Masters like to have prepared notes concerning all the 
important things the Adventurers can see, hear and feel, whilst others prefer to focus on details 
concerning the story at hand. In time you will develop a style that is uniquely yours but, to assist 
in developing that style, some pointers for scenario presentation are as follows.

Preparation: Some preparation is always necessary, although the degree of prep depends on the 
Games Master’s confidence, the nature of the scenario and the campaign and, more often than 
not, time. If using a published scenario you should have read it at least once and made notes on 
changes you need to make, based on what you know of the players and Adventurers, including, 
where necessary, amendments to encounter statistics to make the scenario rewarding but neither 

186.204.39.123

229

too easy or too hard. If using your own material then notes on the general flow of the story, 
encounters and so on will be necessary but need not be extensive. Bullet-points or one-line notes 
concerning the importance of a Non-Player Character, an event, encounter and so forth may be 
enough. It is common for the flow of play to determine which details need lengthy description 
and what can be summarised in a simple sentence: very often, the areas where lots of description 
has been lavished are those that least require it – usually because the action leading up to that 
point has helped create a strong enough mental image in the players’ minds.

Statistics:  It  is  not  necessary  to  create,  from  scratch,  monsters,  creatures  and  Non-Player 
Characters. Use samples from published adventures if you do not have time to create your own 
but even then, it is not always necessary to roll the Characteristics for every single trollkin in a 
group of 20 – use the average value given in a creature’s description, instead. Even then, you may 
only need a handful of statistics: Magic Points, Combat Actions, Movement, Combat Skills, 
Persistence and Resilience and a couple of major skills, such as Athletics and Evade. If you use 
General Hit Points for underlings and minor Adventurers, as outlined in the Combat chapter, 
then you may not even need to use the Hit Locations, either. The watchword is expedience: 
where  statistics  are  concerned,  note  down  only  what  you  are  certain  to  use.  If  other  values 
are needed for some reason, then there is nothing wrong with a little improvisation as long as 
percentages you use reflect that nature of the creature and fit the general risk of the scenario. All 
creatures are different – just like Adventurers!
Book Keeping
Keeping track of how Adventurers develop and progress is as important for the Games Master as 
the players. By keeping a note of Adventurer’s key skills, their levels, magic and magnitudes and 
so forth, scenarios can be more easily tailored to the capabilities of the Adventurers, thus keeping 
them challenged and rewarded. Things Games Masters should note, in some form:

•	 Gains or losses of possessions and equipment.
•	 Community – parents, siblings, uncles and aunts: how many, where they live and who they 
are. Use this information for scenario inspiration and background colour. Rescuing a family 
member  from  peril  is  often  far  more  emotionally  rewarding  than  a  random  Non-Player 
Character invented for the sake for the scenario.

•	 Training and mentoring – what have the Adventurers trained in recently? How was the 
relationship with the trainer? Does training come at something more than a financial cost? 
Do Adventurers need to prove what they have learned before more training is available?

•	 Magic – how was magic improved or more spells learned? As with training, there may be an 

onus on the Adventurers to do something in return.

•	 Major  foes,  rivals  and  enemies.  Having  recurring  villains  and  antagonists  helps  bring  a 
scenario to life and mirrors popular fiction and drama. Note also how the relationship with 
these antagonists changes with circumstances – a deadly foe might need to become an ally 
for a while, in certain circumstances.
Skills – what skills do the Adventurers routinely improve? How are they changing compared 
with other skills and the other adventurers? Games Masters might need to make suggestions 
for helping an Adventurer to remain balanced and some skills, particularly those related to 
cults, might need more attention than others.

•	

If the campaign has truly engaged the players much of the book keeping will be collaborative as 
the scope of the campaign will be discussed between scenarios and game sessions. This is to be 
encouraged as it helps to maintain momentum and involvement. The players gain a true stake in 
their Adventurers, resulting in a richer, more rewarding experience.
Risk
How hard is the scenario for the Adventurers? If the dangers and encounters they face are too 
easy, then little challenge or threat is posed and the players may feel short-changed as a result. 
Although players like to succeed, few players want to have had an easy ride. Likewise, if the 
scenario is too tough, resulting in lots of wounds or Adventurer deaths, the players may feel 

230
186.204.39.123

hard-done by: success should not be a certainty but then again, neither should instant death: the 
scenario needs to balance risk.

A reasonable way of approaching risk is to look at the skills of the Adventurers – combat and 
magical skills, certainly, but also skills that will aid fight, flight and negotiation. How high are the 
skills, generally? What is the highest skill possessed by any one Adventurer? How much magic 
and at what Magnitude do they have it? Are there any special things the Adventurers have that 
can aid them – contacts, cult affiliations and so on – that they can call upon if things become 
very tough?

Now, gauge the strength of the threats, especially Combat Encounters that the Adventurers are 
likely to face. If using a published scenario, adjust the skills and magic of the encounters and, if 
using your own material, create the encounters at a suitable level.

What constitutes a suitable level depends on the nature of the reward or objective of the scenario 
but, in general, use the following checklist:

•	

Skills of enemies should not be more than 20% higher than the average opposing skills of 
the Adventurers. Around a third of the creatures should be around 20% lower, representing 
easy challenges, one third about the same and one third 20% higher. Of course, particular 
Non-Player Characters may have much higher skills reflecting their status and position but 
think long and hard about whether or not such encounters will result in a conflict and, if 
so, what resources the Adventurers have to help them deal with it.

•	 Consider what Combat Manoeuvres foes will use in combat ahead of the encounters. Might 
they have favoured combinations or specialities? Do not rely on manoeuvres that inflict 
high  amounts  of  damage  –  like  Bypass  Armour  and  Maximise  Damage  –  all  the  time; 
think creatively about the encounter’s aims, skills and nature; not all fights should end in 
death. Jot down these options next to the encounter’s statistics. Do not be afraid to vary 
them according to the nature of the fight but also try to remain consistent with your plans. 
Knowing that the elves of Grimwood Forest always try to Pin Weapon as a first Combat 
Manoeuvre can assist the Adventurers in their own strategies and may encourage them to 
use different tactics for different foes.

•	 Enemies  should  have  roughly  the  same  Magnitude  of  spells  available  to  them  as  the 
Adventurers.  Challenging  opponents  may  have  a  few  extra  Magnitude  more  but  spread 
around  different  spells  and  effects.  Thus,  if  the  Adventurers  tend  to  have  an  average 
Magnitude of 4 in typical Common Magic spells, an opponent might have Bladesharp 5 or 
6 but not Bladesharp 10.

Scenario Aids

This section provides some additional rules and reference materials to assist Games Masters in 
presenting and planning scenarios. None of these rules additions or the encounter tables are 
compulsory;  they  are  here  to  act  as  inspiration  and,  when  necessary,  a  fast  way  of  providing 
colour, information or spurs for action.
Weather
Weather conditions can be of importance in any scenario. Some spells affect the weather or rely 
on certain kinds of weather for their effect; poor weather can inhibit travel or other activities. 
Weather therefore includes wind strength, cloud cover, temperature and rain (precipitation).

Wind
Wind has an STR score, determining its effect on objects and the landscape. If a random wind 
STR is needed, roll 1D100 and divide the result by two, rounding up.

Where a wind can disturb and carry loose material, which may affect visibility, the percentage 
reduction in visibility for Perception rolls and other skills relying on sight is half the wind’s STR 
and equal to the wind’s STR for using Perception to listen or scent something. A hurricane, for 

186.204.39.123

231

example, reduces visibility (and Perception rolls) by a minimum of 23% for the purposes of sight 
but 46% for the purposes of hearing and scent.

Cloud Cover
The  amount  of  visible  sky  is  determined  by  cloud  cover.  The  cloud  cover  percentage  also 
determines the percentage chance of rainfall in any six hour period. For randomly determined 
cloud cover, roll 1D100 and adjust by season:

Spring 
+0
Summer  –20
Autumn  +10
Winter  +20

Rain scales of Very Heavy and above may cause local flooding, landslides and so forth, according 
to the terrain.

Travel and Encounters
Adventurers will, most likely, spend a good deal of their time travelling. Often it is enough to 
simply state ‘after three uneventful days, you reach the outskirts of the city’ but in many scenarios 
or stories, the journey is the story, with the method of travel and the things that happen whilst 
travelling forming the core of the adventure.

Encounter tables are provided for a variety of situations, useful for improvising or acting as the 
catalyst for a planned encounter. 

Getting There
The  cost  of  travel  depends  primarily  upon  the  standard  of  living  maintained.  Adventurers 
travelling by land can, ostensibly, travel for free, provided they are willing to walk the entire 
distance, gather or kill their own food on the way and sleep beneath the bushes at night. Such a 
method of travel is slow and exhausting, however, and Adventurers will often need to move from 
place-to-place in a hurry. 

Be aware that the distances shown on the Comparative Movement Table  represent the optimum 
for unencumbered Adventurers; but weather conditions, terrain, armour and other burdens will 
inevitably reduce the rates of travel. There is no hard and fast rule on how local conditions will 
affect travel distances but use the following as a guide:

Travel Costs
The costs for land travel on the Travel Expenses table assume the Adventurers are using one 
or more pack animals and are spending their nights in some kind of shelter. These costs are 
meant to be used as guidelines by the Games Master. There are a variety of factors that may 
increase or decrease the cost for any manner of travel. If the Adventurers are renowned heroes, 
for example, the merchant caravan will probably not charge them anything (and may even pay 
the Adventurers) to travel with them, on the assumption the Adventurers will be able to deal 
efficiently with any threat. On the other hand, if the Adventurers are known to have enemies that 
have, in the past, attacked and destroyed ships they were travelling on a ship’s captain may refuse 
to allow them on board without adding a zero to the end of the daily cost of passage.

Half

There are no variations in the costs given for different settlement sizes, as it is assumed Adventurers 
travelling for any length of time will pass through hamlets, towns, cities and wilderness.

Legend & Open Content

Here at Mongoose Publishing, we want what we truly believe to be one of the best fantasy 
RPGs on the market to be easy to use and modify.  We have therefore made this rulebook 

Open Content, in conjunction with the Open Game Licence.  

All the text of this book is designated as Open Content – this means you are free to use 

the Open Game Licence (overleaf) to reproduce this text and build upon it with your own 
scenarios and mechanics. You can even print and sell such work, if that is your desire (and we 

would wish you the very best of luck if you choose to do this!).

By using the Open Content of this book, you also have permission to download the Legend 

Compatible logo from our web site (on the Legend product pages), and use that on any 
Legend work you publish, to demonstrate your material is part of the wider Legend family.

Please note that the artwork in this book is not Open Content.

All books in the core Legend range (those whose titles have the word ‘Legend’ in them) 

will also be designated as Open Content, allowing you to expand your own games in many 

different directions, while maintaining a solid root that everyone will be familiar with.

For example, you might be using Legend to produce your own gaming world. If you wanted 
to add some high seas action, you can simply and quickly bring over the Open Content rules 
we produce in, say, Pirates of Legend, knowing that everyone who plays Legend will at least 

be familiar with those rules.
