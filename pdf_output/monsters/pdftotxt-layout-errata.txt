Traits Page 4
Poison Immunity: The creature is immune to all poisons. All creatures without SIZ
automatically have this Trait and it is not listed in their descriptions.

Possession, Covert: An insidious means of possession, covert possession means,
essentially, that the spirit is a hitchhiker in the body of the possessed. It exhibits no
control over the body and the possessed remains completely in charge. In many cases,
the possessed may not even know he is possessed.

Possession, Dominant: The more well-known and obvious form of possession,
dominant possession occurs when the possessing entity literally takes control of the
possessed body. The identity (INT, POW and CHA) of the body’s owner is subsumed
beneath the identity of the possessing spirit. The possessed is absolutely helpless,
unable to take any action at all, unable even to regain Magic Points, a prisoner in his
own body. The possessor is in complete control, though it does not have access to any
of the memories, skills or magic of the possessed.

Regeneration: The creature is able to regenerate hit points lost to damage. The speed
of regeneration varies depending upon the creature.

Trample: The creature is able to trample beings with a SIZ of half or less its own. This
attack inflicts damage equal to double the creature’s Damage Modifier and requires the
creature to expend Movement. A creature with this trait may Trample even if it has only
one Combat Action – the Trample is assumed to be part of its Movement.

Wall Walking: The creature can move freely on vertical surfaces and even move upside
down on a ceiling with no special equipment. Such Movement is always at half the
creature’s normal Movement rate.

Vampiric Touch: The creature can drain one or more of a character’s Characteristics
permanently by touch.
    Chaotic Features
    Creatures of Chaos are often hideously malformed, displaying a wide range of mutations
    that can both help and hinder the recipient. If a creature is noted as having Chaotic
    Features, use the following table to determine their effect. Although Chaotic Features
    can make for some truly deformed and horrid creatures, some results are simply not
    appropriate for some monsters.

    Note that the Chaotic Features table uses eight-sided dice to modify characteristics.
    The number eight is traditionally associated with chaos and it is therefore fitting to
    use an eight-sided die to modify a chaos creature’s characteristics, either positively or
    negatively.

    Chaotic Features
    01 Absorbing           If the creature strikes successfully with a natural weapon,
                           1D8 Magic Points are absorbed and added as temporary
                           Characteristic or Attribute points; roll 1D10, 1=STR,
                           2=CON, 3=DEX, 4=SIZ, 5=INT, 6=POW, 7=CHA, 8=MP,
                           9=HP or 10= Add points to the Damage Modifier (1D2+4,
                           for instance, if 4 MP absorbed).
    02    Accursed         Temporarily weakens the soul of an opponent by 1D8 POW

    03    Acidic           Possesses acidic ichor which sprays whenever the skin is
                           penetrated, causing damage to the attacker; roll 1D4, 1=1D2,
                           2=1D4, 3=1D6 and 4=1D8 damage per wound.

                           the Allurement’s potency of 1D8x10%. If the resistance fails
                           the victim is hopelessly allured by the creature for 21–INT
                           Combat Rounds.

                           5=Ethoception (senses souls), 6=Magiception (senses any type
                           of magic).
    07    Apathetic        –1D8 POW.
    08    Armed            Uses physical weapons having an appropriate Combat Style
                           for 1D4 different types.

                           other, double the Hit Points of locations in the larger side and
                           halve the Hit Points of locations in the smaller.

                    Persistence each successful hit. The drain is not permanent;

30   Droning        Produces a buzzing noise that sedates listeners, who must
                    succeed in an opposed test of Persistence against the Droning’s
                    potency of 1D8 x10% to avoid falling asleep for 1D8 minutes.


                                                                                      3

    37   Hatred       Creature possesses unreasoning hatred of a particular species
                      and will attack on sight. Creature also gains the Fixated
                      feature.

         Wealth       fist. Roll 1D6 for its properties: 1 = Worth 1D10 x1,000

                      to the creature’s POW divided by 3. Using the spell requires
                      the gem’s owner to make a successful Persistence roll. 6 = The
                      gem offers 1D8 uses of a randomly chosen Sorcery spell at a
                      Magnitude equal to the creature’s POW divided by 3. Using

49   Mutable       Every 1D3 Combat Rounds the creature mutates into a
                   different form as determined on the Physique Type table on
                   page xx. The transformation lasts 2 Combat Actions during
                   which time the creature is vulnerable. The creature completes
                   the transformation with all its original characteristics the same
                   but gaining additional hit locations (or losing them) according
                   to the nature of the transformation. Owing to the creature’s
                   disturbing mutability, all attacks against it are at –20% and
                   –40% whilst it is transforming (although it can neither attack

54   Observant     One of the creature’s sensory organs either grows bigger (x1D4
                   in size) or multiplies (x1D4 in number), adding a +1D8x10%
                   bonus to the Perception skill when using that sensory
                   perception; roll a D6, 1=Sight, 2=Sound, 3=Smell, 4=Taste,
                   5=Touch and 6=Other (if possessed).

                   its Hit Points
56   Paralysing    Temporarily weakens the dexterity of an opponent by 1D8

59   Poisonous     One unarmed attack inflicts a venomous poison with a delay
                   of 1D8 combat actions and a potency of 1D8x 10%, which
                   causes an extra 1D8 damage to the location struck.




                                                                                       5
    60   Pregnant        The creature is pregnant with 1D8 young. If killed, these vile
                         offspring explode from the carcass of the parent and have half its
                         statistics. The young are voraciously hungry and incredibly aggressive,
                         launching attacks on the nearest living thing. Alternatively, the
                         offspring view whatever living thing they first see as the parent and
                         form an immediate, emotional (and perhaps physical) bond…
    61   Quick           Double Movement.

                         poison, disease, swords, spears, cudgels and so forth.
    65   Roaring         Produces a thunderous sound which deafens listeners,
                         who must succeed in an opposed test of Resilience against
                         the Roaring’s potency of 1D8x10% to avoid becoming
                         temporarily deaf.

                         mesmerised. Mesmerised characters are rooted to the spot for

                         of 1D8x10%. Failure to do so causes the listener to crumple
                         into a sobbing, whimpering, foetal ball for 1D3 rounds.
    69   Shadowy         Can control the ambient light in its immediate surroundings,
                         gaining a 1D8x10% bonus to Stealth in daylight conditions or
                         total invisibility in twilight/night conditions.
    70   Shaggy          Gain 1D4 Armour Points from a thick, hairy pelt.

    78   Spores          Produces clouds of spores. If inhaled the breather must win an
                         opposed test of Resilience against the Spore’s potency of 1D8x10%
                         to avoid suffering 1D8 Hit Points to the chest every round until
                         successful; as the spores gestate into worms, flowers, vines and so on
                         that are coughed up or grow out of the victim’s lungs.

80   Stench           Gives off nauseating odours that sicken inhalers, who must
                      succeed in an opposed test of Resilience against the Stench’s
                      potency of 1D8x10% to avoid dropping prone and vomiting

                      stinger on a different location; roll 1D4, 1=1D6 damage,
