Alex Greene (order #3140110)                                                                                             8
                                       introduction
       The world is wide and dangerous. Beasts of all descriptions – natural and supernatural – hunt,
       lurk and prey on the unwary. Non-human, intelligent races co-exist with humankind, sometimes
       in competition, sometimes harmoniously and sometimes acrimoniously. Adventurers, whether
       at home or on their travels, will encounter creatures of all persuasions and will hunt them, be
       hunted by them, trade with them and, inevitably, battle them.

       This book details a selection of creatures for Legend, along with the rules that distinguish them
       from Adventurers. However, as is evident from each creature’s entry, they possess the same
       characteristics and attributes as humans and, very often, similar skills. This means that some
       creatures can also be played as Adventurers, for those players and Games Masters who want, and
       enjoy, a mixture of human and non-human races in their Legend games.

       Monsters of Legend requires only the Legend Core Rulebook. Arms of Legend may prove useful but
       is by no means essential.


       Adventuring Creatures
       Every creature detailed in this book has a set of statistics that may be used to represent most
       individuals of that species that the players face – these are considered to be ‘average’ members
       of the species.

       Alternatively, Games Masters are free to generate their own creature characters, using all the normal
       rules in the Adventurer Creation chapter of the Legend Core Rulebook. Every creature listed in this
       book have random Characteristics and any important traits listed, allowing Games Masters to create
       a character from each creature race. In addition, Games Masters might like to use the experience
       rules from the Improving Adventurers chapter in the Legend Core Rulebook to make more powerful
       creatures for players to confront. This is particularly relevant when creating ‘leader’ type characters.
       For example, if there is a beastman lair within a scenario, it makes perfect sense to have perhaps a
       dozen of the ‘average’ beastmen and a leader who is much more powerful than the rest.


       Creatures and Intelligence
       Some of the creatures listed in this book have randomly determined INT, such as the beastmen
       with an INT of 2D6+6. Others have only a single number listed as INT. A creature with a
       randomly determined INT is considered sapient – it is a rational creation capable of logical
       thought and self-determination. A creature with a fixed INT (any INT listed as a single number,
       rather than a die roll) is sentient but not sapient.

       Fixed-INT creatures tend to operate on instinct, rather than logic or intuition. This does not mean
       that all fixed-INT creatures with the same INT score are identically intelligent but it does mean
       that all lions (INT 5) are more intelligent than horses (INT 4). Creatures with a very large fixed
       INT have rudimentary reasoning abilities, as well as a set of complex and finely-honed instincts.

         Traits
         Many creatures have Traits. These are special abilities above and beyond their normal
         Characteristics, Attributes and Skills. The full description of these Traits and their effect on the
         game is covered here.

         Breathe Flame
         The creature may breathe flame over an area as a Combat Action. The flame covers a cone in
         front of the creature, which stretches for its POW in metres. At its furthest extent, the cone is
         equal to ½ the creature’s POW in width.

         Any Adventurer caught in the flame suffers the noted fire damage to all Hit Locations, though
         an Adventurer may dive for cover to halve this damage and Armour Points count as normal.

         A creature may only breathe flame once in a specified time period (usually once per hour or once
         per day). Further attempts to breathe flame within this time period require the creature to make
         a Resilience test, with a cumulative –20% penalty for every attempt.

         Dark Sense
         The creature possess a combination of Dark Sight, olfactory awareness and echolocation to
         achieve precise underground awareness and orientation. Creatures with this trait function as well
         underground as humans function above it in broad daylight.

         Dark Sight
         Allows the creature to treat pitch black conditions as darkness.

         Diseased
         The creature carries a contagious disease, which is passed on to anyone who is wounded by its
         attacks, or remains in close proximity to its body without sanitary precautions. The description
         will describe the particular contagion the creature employs.

         Earth Sense
         Some creatures are so in tune with the rock around them that they can work perfectly well in the
         total darkness of the deep. By sensing heat and air pressure, a creature with Earth Sense can fight
         and make Perception tests with no penalty, so long as their target is no more than 10 metres away.

         Excellent Swimmer
         The creature gains a +30% bonus to its Athletics skill whenever swimming. In addition, the
         creature uses its normal Movement score when swimming.

         Formidable Natural Weapons
         This creature’s natural weapons are as tough and durable as metal. As such they may parry
         weapon attacks. The SIZ of the weapon, for parrying purposes, is given in the description of the
         creature’s attacks.

         Life Sense
         In tune with the rhythms of nature, this creature can determine the vitality of any living creature
         by touch alone. If the creature touches another and makes a successful Perception test, it will
         learn of the target’s current Hit Points, Fatigue level and whether it is currently afflicted by any
         poison or disease.


                                                                                                                3
Alex Greene (order #3140110)                                                                                        8
       Magic Sense
       This allows supernatural creatures, such as spirits, to perceive the magical aura of other creatures.
       A successful Perception test reveals the current Magic Points and any extant spells or magical
       effects upon another creature or object.

       Night Sight
       Allows the creature to treat partial darkness as illuminated and darkness as partial darkness.

       Poison
       One of the creature’s attacks, or possibly its very form, is poisoned. The description will describe
       the particular poison or venom the creature employs.

       Poison Immunity
       The creature is immune to all poisons. All creatures without SIZ automatically have this Trait
       and it is not listed in their descriptions.

       Possession, Covert
       An insidious means of possession, covert possession means, essentially, that the spirit is a
       hitchhiker in the body of the possessed. It exhibits no control over the body and the possessed
       remains completely in charge. In many cases, the possessed may not even know he is possessed.

       Possession, Dominant
       The more well-known and obvious form of possession, dominant possession occurs when
       the possessing entity literally takes control of the possessed body. The identity (INT, POW
       and CHA) of the body’s owner is subsumed beneath the identity of the possessing spirit. The
       possessed is absolutely helpless, unable to take any action at all, unable even to regain Magic
       Points, a prisoner in his own body. The possessor is in complete control, though it does not have
       access to any of the memories, skills or magic of the possessed.

       Regeneration
       The creature is able to regenerate hit points lost to damage. The speed of regeneration varies
       depending upon the creature.

       Trample
       The creature is able to trample beings with a SIZ of half or less its own. This attack inflicts
       damage equal to double the creature’s Damage Modifier and requires the creature to expend
       Movement. A creature with this trait may Trample even if it has only one Combat Action – the
       Trample is assumed to be part of its Movement.

       Wall Walking
       The creature can move freely on vertical surfaces and even move upside down on a ceiling with
       no special equipment. Such Movement is always at half the creature’s normal Movement rate.

       Vampiric Touch
       The creature can drain one or more of a character’s Characteristics permanently by touch.

       Chaotic Features
       Creatures of Chaos are often hideously malformed, displaying a wide range of mutations that
       can both help and hinder the recipient. If a creature is noted as having Chaotic Features, use the
       following table to determine their effect. Although Chaotic Features can make for some truly
       deformed and horrid creatures, some results are simply not appropriate for some monsters.

       Note that the Chaotic Features table uses eight-sided dice to modify characteristics. The number
       eight is traditionally associated with chaos and it is therefore fitting to use an eight-sided die to
       modify a chaos creature’s characteristics, either positively or negatively.

       Chaotic Features
       01     Absorbing         If the creature strikes successfully with a natural weapon, 1D8 Magic
                                Points are absorbed and added as temporary Characteristic or Attribute
                                points; roll 1D10, 1=STR, 2=CON, 3=DEX, 4=SIZ, 5=INT, 6=POW,
                                7=CHA, 8=MP, 9=HP or 10= Add points to the Damage Modifier
                                (1D2+4, for instance, if 4 MP absorbed).
       02     Accursed          Temporarily weakens the soul of an opponent by 1D8 POW each
                                successful hit.
       03     Acidic            Possesses acidic ichor which sprays whenever the skin is penetrated,

                                succeed in an opposed test of Persistence against the Allurement’s
                                potency of 1D8x10%. If the resistance fails the victim is hopelessly
                                allured by the creature for 21–INT Combat Rounds.
       06     Antennae          Large antennae which sprout from a random location and grant a new
                                primary sense; roll 1D6, 1=Echolocation (sonar), 2=Thermoception
                                (senses heat), 3=Insanoception (senses madness and insanity),
                                4=Nociception (senses pain), 5=Ethoception (senses souls),
                                6=Magiception (senses any type of magic).
       07     Apathetic         –1D8 POW.
       08     Armed             Uses physical weapons having an appropriate Combat Style for 1D4

       11     Asymmetric        One half of the creature is larger, longer or taller than the other, double
                                the Hit Points of locations in the larger side and halve the Hit Points
                                of locations in the smaller.
       12     Beaked            Gain a bite attack. Each additional incidence adds another toothed
                                beak on a different location; roll 1D4, 1=1D6 damage, 2=1D8 damage,
                                3=1D10 damage or 4=1D12 damage.
       13     Beautiful         +1D8 CHA.
       14     Big               +1D8 SIZ.

                                well. Creature is impervious to any attacks or spells affecting sight.

                                been wounded too.
         18    Burning          Glows with burning heat, injuring anyone within melee range; roll
                                1D4, 1=1D2, 2=1D4, 3=1D6 and 4=1D8 damage per round.

                             instantly; 4 = Spell Focus – the gem offers 1D8 uses of a randomly
                             chosen Common Magic spell at a Magnitude equal to the creature’s
                             POW divided by 3; 5 = The gem offers 1D8 uses of a randomly chosen

                             by 3. Using the spell requires the gem’s owner to make a successful

       40    Horned          Gain a gore attack. Each additional incidence adds another set of horns
                             on a different location; roll 1D4, 1=1D6 damage, 2=1D8 damage,
                             3=1D10 damage or 4=1D12 damage.
       41    Icy             Radiates freezing coldness, injuring anyone within melee range; roll
                             1D4, 1=1D2, 2=1D4, 3=1D6 and 4=1D8 damage per round.
       42    Intangible      Cannot be harmed physically (roll again if Inviolate).
       43    Inverted        All vital organs are external, thus all successful attacks upon it are
                             automatically treated as critical successes.
       44    Inviolate       Cannot be harmed magically (roll again if Intangible).
       45    Leaper          Has powerfully sprung legs, +1D8 x10% bonus to Athletics when

                             sinking or leaving tracks.
       48    Mimic           Changes into the shape of a creature it successfully touches, maintaining
                             its own Characteristics but assuming the locations and a duplicate
                             image of the being contacted.
       49    Mutable         Every 1D3 Combat Rounds the creature mutates into a different
                             form as determined on the Physique Type table on page xx. The
                             transformation lasts 2 Combat Actions during which time the creature
                             is vulnerable. The creature completes the transformation with all its
                             original characteristics the same but gaining additional hit locations
                             (or losing them) according to the nature of the transformation. Owing
                             to the creature’s disturbing mutability, all attacks against it are at –20%
                             and –40% whilst it is transforming (although it can neither attack nor
                             defend).
       50    Mutated         Roll a random hit location, which no longer exists.
       51    Nerveless       Cannot feel pain and does not suffer the ill-effects of serious wounds.
       52    Numb            No sense of touch.
       53    Obfuscating     Produces a cloud of mist that blinds observers, who must succeed in
                             an opposed test of Perception against the Obfuscation’s potency of
                             1D8x10% every Combat Action to keep the creature in sight.
       54    Observant       One of the creature’s sensory organs either grows bigger (x1D4 in size)
                             or multiplies (x1D4 in number), adding a +1D8x10% bonus to the
                             Perception skill when using that sensory perception; roll a D6, 1=Sight,
                             2=Sound, 3=Smell, 4=Taste, 5=Touch and 6=Other (if possessed).

         55    Oversized       One location is swollen to a very large size or length, doubling its Hit
                               Points
         56    Paralysing      Temporarily weakens the dexterity of an opponent by 1D8 DEX each
                               successful hit. DEX points are recovered at the rate of 1 per hour after
                               the end of the encounter.
         57    Patterned       Weird colouring and markings, tiger stripes, spots, blotches and so
                               forth, granting a +1D8 x10% bonus to Stealth.
         58    Phobic          Creature is scared of one thing; singing, light, cats and so on.
         59    Poisonous       One unarmed attack inflicts a venomous poison with a delay of 1D8
                               combat actions and a potency of 1D8x 10%, which causes an extra
                               1D8 damage to the location struck.
         60    Pregnant        The creature is pregnant with 1D8 young. If killed, these vile offspring
                               explode from the carcass of the parent and have half its statistics. The
                               young are voraciously hungry and incredibly aggressive, launching
                               attacks on the nearest living thing. Alternatively, the offspring view
                               whatever living thing they first see as the parent and form an immediate,
                               emotional (and perhaps physical) bond…
         61    Quick           Double Movement.
         62    Reflecting      All spells cast on the creature are reflected back upon the caster.

                               disease, swords, spears, cudgels and so forth.
         65    Roaring         Produces a thunderous sound which deafens listeners, who must
                               succeed in an opposed test of Resilience against the Roaring’s potency
                               of 1D8x10% to avoid becoming temporarily deaf.
         66    Scaly           Gain 1D6 Armour Points from reptilian scales.
         67    Scintillating   A shifting polychromatic appearance that confuses onlookers, who
                               must succeed in an opposed test of Persistence against the Scintillation’s
                               potency of 1D8x10% to avoid becoming mesmerised. Mesmerised
                               characters are rooted to the spot for 1D3 Combat Rounds.
         68    Screaming       Horrible screams which terrify listeners, who must succeed in an
                               opposed test of Persistence against the Screaming’s potency of
                               1D8x10%. Failure to do so causes the listener to crumple into a
                               sobbing, whimpering, foetal ball for 1D3 rounds.
         69    Shadowy         Can control the ambient light in its immediate surroundings, gaining
                               a 1D8x10% bonus to Stealth in daylight conditions or total invisibility
                               in twilight/night conditions.
         70    Shaggy          Gain 1D4 Armour Points from a thick, hairy pelt.

                               Points.
         73    Skinless        The creature has no Armour Points and cannot wear armour.
         74    Slimy           Leaves a sticky trail wherever it travels.
         75    Slow            Halve Movement.
         76    Small           –1D8 SIZ.
         77    Spiny           Opponents in melee suffer half their own rolled damage if they
                               successfully land an attack.

                               to avoid dropping prone and vomiting for 1D4 Combat Actions.
       81    Sticky            Secretes a strong glue or mucus of potency 1D8x10% which causes

         Creature Descriptions
         The following are just a few species of creatures that can be found in traditional fantasy settings,
         More creatures will be found in Legend expansions.

         Characteristics: Both random and average Characteristic scores are listed here. Use the average
         Characteristics for a typical member of the species; but for detailed creatures, randomly generated
         versions can be used.

         Some creatures have no entry for CHA: this reflects animals, mostly, and indicates that CHA is
         not an important Characteristic for this kind of creature.


                                                                                                                11
Alex Greene (order #3140110)                                                                                         8
       Hit Locations: As well as the random scores for determining which Hit Location is struck in
       combat, there are two scores listed – the first is the natural Armour Points of the location (if any)
       and the second is its Hit Points.

       Attributes, Traits, Skills and Magic: Skills, Combat Actions, Strike Rank Modifier, Movement,
       Traits, Typical Armour and Special Rules are noted beneath the Characteristic and Hit Location
       entries. The skills are the basic skills for the creature type – individual creatures may well possess
       enhanced scores or additional skills.

       All creatures have Persistence and Resilience scores. Generally, Persistence is calculated as the
       creature’s POW multiplied by 3 with a +10% bonus added and Resilience using the same formula
       but based on CON. Some creatures have higher or lower Persistence or Resilience values than
       these formulae generate, reflecting their innate nature.

       Where a creature is capable of using magic, the magical type it is skilled with is quoted, along
       with the appropriate skill value (Common Magic %, Pact and Lore %, and, for Sorcery, Sorcery
       (Grimoire) and Manipulation %). The spells the creature typically has are also listed but for
       custom designed creatures these can be varied, in line with the creature’s magical type.

       Where a creature can fly (dragons, for example), or swim, two Movement rates are given,
       separated by a slash. The first Movement rate is the creature’s ground Movement; the second for
       flying or swimming, as appropriate.

       Weapons: The creature’s preferred and available attacks and/or Combat Styles are listed. Where
       a Combat Style is concerned, the weapons are noted and the respective sizes and reach listed.
       Where weapon and shield styles are listed, size and reach for the weapon and then the shield are
       separated by a slash. The AP/HP for the weapons are similarly listed in the same order.


       Spirit Combat
       Spirit combat can only occur on the Spirit Plane. Since the souls of mortal beings are tied to
       their flesh, they cannot enter the Spirit Plane naturally without aid; and are therefore normally
       insulated from spiritual attack. Likewise spirits which have been bound to a physical fetish are
       tied to the material world and removed from the Spirit Plane.

       However, many spirits such as those of diseases, predatory animals or the malevolent dead, have
       the ability to discorporate the soul of a corporeal creature. This literally drags the mortal’s spirit
       out of its body and fully into the Spirit Plane. Once there, they become vulnerable to spiritual
       combat. In addition, some mortals such as shamans can learn to discorporate themselves and
       High Shamans can even bring others with them into the spirit world. Other methods exist too.
       Some narcotics and rare herbs are said to be able to separate the soul from the body and there are
       even spells that can replicate the effect magically.



       Spirit Domination – Optional Rule
       In many genres the soul of a possessed victim can sometimes fight against the spirit dominating
       him, temporarily regaining control of their own body before the possession is re-established. In
       settings supporting such circumstances Spirit Combat is permitted within the material world but
       only if both spirits are concurrently occupying the same body or fetish.

         Encountering a spirit on the Spirit Plane does not necessarily mean that combat will inevitably
         occur. Many encounters, even with spirits who have discorporated a mortal, can be peaceful,
         mutually beneficial and informative. However, if the spirit is hostile then battle generally follows.
         Fleeing Spirit Combat is impossible for souls who do not have the Spirit Walking skill, or some
         form of magic to escape from the spirit world.

         Spirit combat is run in a very similar way to physical combat, save that lacking physical bodies on
         the Spirit Plane, Attributes are calculated using different characteristics. A spirit or discorporated
         soul’s spiritual attributes are calculated the following way:

         Combat Actions are determined from its average of INT and POW, rather than the average of
         DEX and INT.
         Strike Rank is calculated from the average of INT and CHA, instead of the average of DEX
         and INT.
         Magic Points are calculated as normal but are used by spirits and souls as their Hit Points.
         Spirit Damage is based upon the value of a spirit’s Spectral Combat skill or a soul’s Spirit Binding
         skill; see the Spirit Damage Table. If a discorporated Adventurer lacks Spirit Binding, they use
         half the value of their Persistence on the table instead.

         Spirit combat progresses just like normal combat. Initiative is rolled and the Adventurer or spirit
         with the highest adjusted Strike Rank goes first, the second highest goes second and so on. Thus
         a Spirit Combat can be run simultaneously with physical combat using the same SR countdown.

         Instead of weapons, most spirits have a Spectral Combat skill which they use in Spirit Combat.
         Spirit magicians use their Spirit Binding skill instead, whereas those uninitiated in spirit magic
         must rely on half of their raw Persistence skill. Attacks are made by rolling an Opposed Test
         between the attacker and the defender, using their relevant skills.

         If the attacker wins the Opposed Test they inflict an amount of damage equal to their Spirit
         Damage to the opponent’s Magic Points. If the defender wins, then no damage is incurred.

         If the defender runs out of Combat Actions with which to defend themselves, then they are
         left wide open and the attacker may attempt to make an unopposed attack roll. An Adventurer
         engaged in Spirit Combat may forgo their attack in order to cast magic instead.

         Combat continues until one of the combatants is reduced to zero Magic Points. At this point the
         loser may automatically be either Possessed (if mortal), Bound (if a spirit), Exorcised (if currently
         possessing a mortal) or Dissipated (destroyed). If the dissipated spirit was a discorporated mortal,
         then the physical body dies with the destruction of its soul. Some spirits can recover from being
         dissipated if they have the Recurring trait.


         Possession and Exorcism
         A possessed creature is one whose control of their physical body has been usurped by another
         spirit or soul. This is normally the result of losing a Spirit Combat, whereupon the victor
         entwines itself around the defeated soul and rides it back to the loser’s corporeal body in the
         material world. There are two forms of possession, Dominant and Covert.

         Dominant Possession occurs when the possessing entity literally takes complete control of the
         possessed body. The victim is fully aware that its body has been taken over but is absolutely



                                                                                                                  13
Alex Greene (order #3140110)                                                                                           8
       helpless, unable to take any action at all. The possessor does not have access to any of the
       memories, skills or magic of the possessed but substitutes its own instead.

       To detect a dominant possession requires a successful, unopposed test of either Perception if
       viewed magically, or Spirit Walking.

       Covert Possession is when the spirit hides in the body of the possessed, riding it like a hitchhiker.
       The victim retains complete control over his body and remains completely unaware of his
       possession, unless the spirit chooses to inform him of its presence. Some spirits take over the
       victim’s body at night when they are sleeping, thus keeping their existence secret – save for
       inevitable physical exhaustion and fleeting nightmares. Another example of covert possession is a
       curse or disease spirit which infects that creature with some form of debilitation. No manner of
       magic or healing will stop the effects until the spirit responsible is somehow cast out.
        
       Detecting a covert possession requires a successful Opposed Test of the investigator’s Perception
       (if viewed magically) or Spirit Walking skill versus the spirit’s Stealth skill.

       No creature can ever purge itself of a possessing entity. They may only be exorcised by a separate
       individual defeating the possessor in Spirit Combat, or by successfully casting a specific type of
       expulsion magic. If the original body of a mortal possessor has been killed in its absence, then its
       soul dies when it is exorcised. Spirits merely return to the spirit plane.

       Needless to say, a possessing spirit or soul can willingly abandon a possession at any time – unless
       they have been maliciously bound to that particular body.

       Dwarf
       Often at conflict with elves. They will, however, set aside their differences to take up arms against
       the forces of Evil – making them the enemies of orcs and trolls. They have a great love of their
       underground homes, venturing to the surface only to gain treasure and knowledge before returning
       to their halls to hoard both. Dwarf character is often avaricious but usually has a strong sense of duty.

       Dwarfs are practitioners of sorcery, which fits with their world-view. Common Magic is
       sometimes available to them but usually dismissed as a lesser magical discipline, inferior to the
       craft and skill Sorcery requires.

       Dwarfs are natural choices for Adventurers, although they always feel more at home beneath
       ground than above it. Groups also containing elves do not, however, make for a good mix due
       to their age-old enmities.

       Elf
       This is the traditional fantasy elf; the human-like but long-lived, denizens of the forests and
       woodlands, co-existing with nature to a greater degree than their human brethren. Elves are
       found all over the world, embarking on long quests for ultimate knowledge. However far
       they are from their homes, they remain tied to their forests in ways other races could never
       understand. Though a little humanlike in appearance, elves are slighter in build and often taller
       than humans, with fine bone structure and pointed, tapering ears. Elves are often removed from
       other Adventurers on an emotional level coming across, to humans, as lofty and aloof.

       As they are tied to their forests, elves work with Commonand Divine magic but abhor sorcery,
       which they believe perverts the natural order and harmony of the world. The elf statistics show
       an elf with both Common Magic and a Divine Pact, hence the 3 points of Dedicated POW and
       subsequent lowering of Magic Points for Common Magic.

       Elves make for good Adventurers as they are able to mix well with most races, although ancient
       enmities with dwarves may cause friction within a mixed adventuring group.

       Giant
       Giants are enormous, ugly humanoids with misshapen features and notoriously bad dispositions.
       At as much as 16 metres, a full-grown giant is a terrible enemy. Giants usually grow at the rate of
       1D6 SIZ and 1D6 STR every five years.

       Giants tend to use mighty clubs (and sometimes even tree trunks) in battle. Because of the sheer
       size of a giant, Adventurers of SIZ 20 or less only roll 1D10 to determine Hit Location when
       attacking it in close combat. A giant’s Movement is equal to six plus its height, in metres.

       The Characteristics reflect a six metre high giant. For every two metres of height, a giant rolls
       3D6+6 for STR, 2D6+6 for CON and 3D6+6 for SIZ.

       Due to their incredible size and the difficulties of operating in the environments of smaller races,
       giants are not well suited to being Adventurers but smaller members of the giant race can be used

       Goblin
       Ugly, crabby, stunted humanoids, ranging in height between that of a dwarf and a human, goblins
       are secretive, typically avaricious, frequently malicious (but not always so) and cunning. Most
       goblins dwell in caves or underground lairs away from civilised settlements but not always so far
       that they cannot benefit from what civilisation has to offer. Their skin is usually dark green or ochre
       in colour, with long, pointed noses, pock-marked complexions, deep wrinkles and narrow, slitted
       eyes. Mouths are lipless and filled with small, sharp, white teeth. Their arms are disproportionately
       long compared with their bodies but legs are short and sometimes bowed. Their backs are sometimes
       hunched but this is by no means common.

       Goblins share some racial traits with elves, dwarves and trolls hinting at some form of common
       ancestry but all three of these races are quick to deny any connection. Goblins are social amongst
       their own kind and resentful of – but not always aggressive towards – other races and they often
       emulate the trappings of civilisation, dressing in (what they consider to be) the latest fashions
       and adopting civilised mannerisms.

       Goblins have some skill with Common Magic and, very occasionally, Sorcery but tend not
       to pursue higher forms of magic for reasons best known to themselves. They can be used
       as Adventurers although a party containing a goblin may be the subject of (perhaps unjust)
       suspicion from others.

       Halfling
       Halflings are small humanoids who make their comfortable homes in temperate climes. They
       usually live underground, preferably in a house bored into the side of a hill. Appearing as children
       to some, Halflings tend to be stout but this is mostly a product of their comfortable existence
       and passion for food and drink. Halfling skill in the culinary arts is legendary. Despite their
       diminutive stature and love of the finer things in life, halflings are not without curiosity for the
       wider world: most are literate and enjoy stories and legends, documenting them with appropriate
       embellishment. Their skill with words makes for good scribes.

       As a general rule, halflings prefer to avoid conflict and, as a result of this, halfling villages are
       usually located away from the wild corners of the world, where monsters and dangerous beasts
       are little more than stories from distant lands. Most halfling adventurers are those few members
       of the race who grow weary of this bucolic existence and set out to make their own way in the
       larger world.

         Ogre
         A generally malign race, ogres are virtually impossible to distinguish from humans. They are all
         but identical to humans in size and features, though they are much stronger and have very sharp,
         white teeth which are used to slice through flesh. Their favourite meat is human.

         Ogres rarely exist in groups of their own kind – they are much more likely to be found in a
         population of humans, using their physical similarity to blend seamlessly into human society.
         Obviously, given their preference for a diet of sentient beings, ogres must keep their true identities
         secret and indulge their appetites only in secret or when none can gainsay them.

         Ogres can make for perfectly acceptable Adventurers although they may need to carefully hide
         their nature and appetites from comrades and find suitable outlets for feeding.

       Orc
       When some vile, dark god or chaos horror captured elves, it used them to forge its own, vile,
       twisted foot soldiers: the orcs. Hairless, dark skinned and bestial in appearance, orcs are hunched
       and gnarled but fast nevertheless. Hateful of all things bright and just, orcs are things of darkness,
       bent to pain and destruction and bathing the world in the blood.

       As creatures made with darkness at their heart, they suffer a –20% penalty to all skills when
       forced into sunlight. Otherwise they are hostile and aggressive to all races and war even amongst
       themselves.

       Orcs can be used as Adventurers but if so, they should be part of an all-orc group.

       Troll
       This is a fantasy troll, of the Scandinavian type; the sort that terrorises billy goats wanting to
       cross bridges.

       Very large, ugly humanoids, trolls have large noses, large eyes, fearsome, angry expressions, large,
       shambling bodies covered in thick, wiry hair or fur and are exclusively carnivorous, feasting
       on whatever meat they can kill or scavenge. Trolls love to deal in mayhem and do so mainly at
       night: direct sunlight is damaging to them, causing them to sustain 1D3 points of damage to all
       Hit Locations simultaneously at the end of every hour caught in the direct glare of the sun. This
       damage takes the form of petrifaction, the injured location turning to stone as the sunlight takes
       its toll. Any troll caught in sunlight will flee to the nearest dark place rather than risk turning
       into a boulder.

       Trolls are intelligent but not particularly bright. They are unimpressed by shows of bravery but
       fearful of magic, even though they are capable of a few Common Magic spells of their own. They
       live underground, in caves and barrows, where the female troll-wives domineer the hearth, sending
       the beleaguered males out to hunt.

       Ant, Giant
       The ant is a familiar insect that has managed to colonise all but the most cold and inhospitable
       terrain. Social creatures, individuals possess limited intelligence but in groups ants are capable
       of solving complex problems and have very high degrees of co-operation to further the needs of
       the colony.

       Giant ants are the size of a large dog but otherwise function in the same way as their smaller
       brethren. A queen is resident in larger colonies and produces eggs. Workers and drones tend the
       egg nurseries, the queen, hunt for food and protect their territory.

       Ant communication is pheromone-based, with different levels of pheromone being released
       to act as the communicator for others. Ant food trails and territories are marked with
       pheromone trails and anyone entering a giant ant colony’s territory can detect the stale,
       musky scent of pheromones with a successful Perception roll.

       Ants work to their function unless a particular problem requires the communal mind to solve it.
       Thus solitary ants are either gathering food, protecting the egg nurseries or tending the queen.
       If an ant is protecting something it will attack any intruders. Ants on other tasks will typically
       go about their business oblivious to outsiders unless the outsiders represent a viable food source
       or an obstacle to be removed. Thus, ants often scout individually and then return in sufficient
       numbers to deal with a problem.

       If a solitary ant is killed it releases an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack
       frenzy and attracts more ants from further away. The alarm pheromone’s potency means that it
       can reach and alert ants from the same colony up to a distance in kilometres equal to the ant’s
       CON. Thus killing a scout is no guard against further ants turning-up; in fact, it is the precise
       opposite. The alarm pheromone signals every ant within a number of metres equal to the dying
       ant’s CON x10 to attack immediately and summons a further 1D6+1 ants from the colony to
       come and join the attack.

       Every ant colony can react and adapt to its needs, setting ambushes, barricading tunnels, raiding
       animal herds and clearing out nearby menaces. Invading an ant colony is a difficult prospect
       – groups of the ants will ambush the invaders from the rear, seal off passages and set traps such
       as deadfalls for the unwary.

       The queen of an ant colony is simply a breeding machine, possessed of no more INT than any
       other ant. If the queen dies, however, the colony is doomed, as no more eggs will be laid. Thus,
       other ants defend her fiercely. Queens are approximately twice as large and strong as other ants
       of the colony but do not engage in combat.

         Communal Mind
         Individually, ants display intelligence related directly to their function. A single giant ant has
         INT 2, for instance. However, when working together, a communal intelligence develops. Every
         ant co-operating to solve a problem – whether it is moving something out of the way or attacking
         a threat – contributes 1D3 to the communal intelligence. This is added to the ants’ Fixed INT.
         Thus, two ants have a communal INT of 2+2D3 each; three ants have 2+3D3 each and so forth.
         The communal INT is then used to calculate Strike Rank and Combat Actions.

       Bee, Giant
       Giant bees make their hives in the cave systems of hills, mountains and underground, rather
       than building the familiar form of nests favoured by their smaller cousins. Honey is produced
       in vast quantities – and is an attraction for those creatures that feast on sweet, sticky substances;
       however the size of the giant bee means that few honey-stealers will dare tackle a large hive.

       Giant bees are the size of a medium sized dog and are usually peaceful unless the hive is threatened.
       Like ants, their intelligence is based on the size of the community and the problem at hand: treat
       bees in exactly the same way as giant ants when it comes to calculating the INT of larger groups.

       Combat Notes
       Bee venom has the following Characteristics:
       Application: Injection.
       Onset time: 1D12 Combat Rounds.
       Duration: 6D10 minutes.
       Resistance Time: The victim must make a resistance roll at the Onset Time of each stage of the
       poison. Failure indicates that Condition has taken effect.
       Potency: CON x5.
       Resistance: Resilience.
       Conditions: Agony, Asphyxiation. The venom initially causes the victim pain if the first
       Resistance roll is failed. At the end of the Duration the victim must succeed in a final resistance
       roll or suffer the effects of Asphyxiation (see the Legend Core Rulebook).
       Antidote/Cure: Anti-venom. Some cultures have perfected anti-venom remedies which have a Potency
       of 1D20+10. The anti-venom must be introduced with a successful First Aid or Healing roll and add
       their Potency as a bonus to the victim’s Resilience roll to fight the venom throughout its duration.

       The sting of a giant bee is barbed. Using it causes the bee to suffer 2D6 damage to its abdomen
       as it is forced to leave the sting in the victim. However, if a bee stings successfully, the victim
       suffers the effects of an Impale in addition to the bee’s venom.

         Beetle, Giant
         This relates to any of the myriad beetle species found across the world; from cockroaches and
         weevils through to dung beetles and goliath beetles. Giant beetles have lost their ability to fly but
         retain the habits of their smaller relatives.

         Beetles have varied diets. Many are omnivores and feed on decaying plant and animal matter,
         including dung, whilst others are exceedingly specific in their diet. Giant beetles living in forests
         and jungles may soon clear an area of vegetation and thus become migratory.

         Giant beetles are sometimes predatory but generally they are not aggressive (unless of a
         carnivorous variety). Beetles have a tough, chitin exoskeleton and use their large mandibles for
         feeding and defence.

       Centipede, Giant
       Centipedes have long sinuous bodies and a head tipped with a pair of poison claws. Each of its
       many legs ends in a needle-sharp point equipped with a smaller version of the venom glands
       found on its head.

       Centipedes, large or small, are nocturnal predators that hide from the light of the sun in small
       burrows or shaded places. At night, the centipede comes out to hunt. It is perfectly willing to
       slip into a fire-lit camp in order to seize likely prey before rushing back to its nest. Centipedes are
       found in all warm climes, including jungles, deserts and temperate forests, though they prefer to
       live near a plentiful water source. They are solitary creatures.

       The centipede is a complex creature, with an equally complex Hit Location system. The body is
       divided into multiple segments, with each Hit Location covering one or two of these segments.
       The segments are numbered from one through 18, with segment one being immediately behind
       the head and segment 18 being the creature’s posterior. If the centipede’s head is reduced to
       zero Hit Points or lower, it begins to thrash frantically but the fight is over and the creature will
       soon die. If any of the other segments are brought to zero Hit Points but not destroyed, the
       centipede will lose 5m from its Movement rate. If enough locations are incapacitated to reduce
       the creature’s Movement to zero, it will die.

       However, if one of the centipede’s segments is destroyed, all segments behind that one will be
       incapacitated and immobile. Meanwhile, all segments ahead of the one destroyed will attempt to
       run away, carrying the creature’s head with them.

       Combat Notes
       Centipede venom is as follows:

       Application: Injection.
       Onset time: Nausea after 1D3 minutes, Paralysis after 3D6 minutes.
       Duration: 1 hour.
       Resistance Time: The victim must make a Resistance roll at the Onset Time of each stage of the
       poison. Failure indicates that Condition has taken effect.
       Potency: 60.
       Resistance: Resilience.
       Conditions: Nausea, Paralysis. The venom initially causes the victim to start feeling nauseous if
       the first Resistance roll is failed. The location bitten then suffers paralysis if the second Resistance
       roll is failed.
       Antidote/Cure: Anti-venom. Some cultures have perfected anti-venom remedies which have a
       Potency of 1D20+10. The anti-venom must be introduced with a successful First Aid or Healing
       roll and add their Potency as a bonus to the victim’s Resilience roll to fight the venom throughout
       its duration.

       Crab, Giant
       Crabs are the largest of all anthropods but the very largest are restricted to deep water. Land crabs
       are known to rove as far as several miles inland, except during breeding season, when they remain
       on the beach or in the shallows.

       Crabs are opportunistic scavengers who will attack anything that looks even remotely edible.

       Combat Notes
       Giant crabs use their immense claws to both Bash and Grip. The claws are capable of the Sunder
       Combat Manoeuvre although this is applied only if the crab scores a critical success on an
       attack.

         Insect Swarm
         Most Adventurers feel the only insects they have to fear are those that are giant in stature but
         mere humble, normal-sized insects can be every bit as dangerous, provided they assemble in
         large numbers. Insect swarms include large anthills, wasp and hornet nests, and roused beehives.

         Stinging insects are not found anywhere in arctic climes but they are ubiquitous in warmer
         regions of the world. They will not go out of their way to attack a human or other creature vastly
         larger than themselves but if their hive or hill is threatened or damaged, an insect swarm may
         prove too much for even an experienced adventurer to handle.

         Beasts as small as normal insects need no Characteristics and characters cannot truly engage them
         in battle. No matter how skilled a swordsman may be, he will find his weapon useless in the face
         of a swarm of 500 hornets. He can kill one or more with each stroke but ultimately he is just
         wasting his time. Instead, these rules govern the danger posed by a particular hive or hill of stinging
         insects.

         The size of the hive or hill determines the number of stings a swarm delivers every round.
         Consult the chart below.

         Hive Size                                                                  Stings
         Very small (small wasp nest)                                               1D6
         Small (large wasp nest, small beehive)                                     2D6
         Large (very large wasp nest, average beehive)                              4D6
         Very large (large beehive)                                                 6D6
         Huge (enormous anthill, very large beehive)                                8D6 and higher

         Each Adventurer attacked by a hive takes the listed number of stings every round until he
         manages to escape the swarm. Heavy clothing subtracts two stings per die from the number of
         stings suffered every round. Armour subtracts one sting per die, though armour combined with
         heavy clothing will only subtract two stings per die total. Adventurers who take precautions
         against a swarm by wrapping themselves in cloaks, blankets and other heavy fabrics will subtract
         three stings per die. Note that this must be done prior to entering a swarm – by the time the
         Adventurer is taking damage, it is already too late. Such muffling requires three Combat Rounds.
         Specialised beekeeping clothing, only available in civilised areas, subtracts four stings per die of
         damage. Such clothing consists of heavy cloth and multiple layers of mesh costs 75 silvers, weighs
         2 ENC and has no armour value. Magical spells such as Protection subtract one sting per die for
         every two points of Magnitude.

         Creatures with six or more points of natural armour are immune to the effects of an insect
         swarm. No matter how angry a group of hornets get, they are unable to do anything to a creature
         like a dragon.

         An insect swarm always attacks uses its first Combat Action to attack.

         Every round the Adventurer is exposed to the swarm the Games Master should total the number
         of stings taken and multiply that total by the appropriate species’ Venom Factor, as given on the
         Insect Venom table.

       The total number of stings multiplied by the venom factor gives the base Potency of the venom
       introduced into the victim’s body. Insect swarm venom has an onset time of 1D10 Combat
       Rounds. After that time, the Potency of the venom should be matched against the victim’s
       Resilience in a standard opposed test.

       Insect Venom
       Application: Injection.
       Onset time: 1D10 Combat Rounds.
       Duration: 6D10 minutes.
       Resistance Time: The victim must make a resistance roll at the Onset Time of each stage of the
       poison. Failure indicates that Condition has taken effect.
       Potency: See Above.
       Resistance: Resilience.
       Conditions: Agony, Asphyxiation. The venom initially causes the victim pain if the first
       Resistance roll is failed. At the end of the Duration the victim must succeed in a final resistance
       roll or suffer the effects of Asphyxiation (see the Legend Core Rulebook).
       Antidote/Cure: Anti-venom. Some cultures have perfected anti-venom remedies which have a
       Potency of 1D20+10. The anti-venom must be introduced with a successful First Aid or Healing
       roll and add their Potency as a bonus to the victim’s Resilience roll to fight the venom throughout
       its duration.

       The Movement Rate listing shows how fast a swarm can travel if it is pursuing an enemy.

       Driving a swarm away is a troublesome prospect, considering that weapons have no real effect
       on the insects. An insect swarm will not enter an area of heavy smoke and most crawling insects,
       such as ants, will not cross an unbroken line of sulphur powder. Fire is the most effective means
       of dispersing an insect swarm. For every 1D6 of damage a fire does, it reduces the size of a swarm
       by 1D6 every round.

         Leech, Giant
         Usually found living in lakes and rivers, giant leeches can also survive on land, inhabiting
         rainforests and humid jungles where they cling to the branches of trees waiting for a potential
         host to pass by.

         Blood-feeders, giant leeches can hold a number of Hit Points of blood equal to their SIZ x5
         before becoming satiated and detaching from the host. Once attached, a leech remains that
         way unless it is burned-off (which may risk injuring the host) or removed with either magic
         or surgery. The mouth parts bury deep enough into the host to prevent it from being removed
         easily, although it injects a local anaesthetic so that the host feels no pain whilst the leech is
         attached and feeding.

         Killing a leech that is in situ stops it from feeding but does not detach it. A leech that remains
         attached causes no further damage but looks unsightly and effectively reduces the CHA of the
         host by half. A dead leech will fall off naturally after 2D6 days.

       Locust, Giant
       Locusts are herbivorous, swarming insects characterised by a set of powerful hind legs that allow the
       creature to leap large distances – although locusts also have a set of sheathed wings allowing them to
       fly. The normal sized version of the insect has a tendency to engage in a feeding swarm, an activity
       that can devastate croplands as millions of the insect rapidly move through an area stripping it of
       vegetation. The giant version is far less likely to do this and giant locust swarms are extremely rare
       owing to the rarity of the creature itself.

       Giant locusts are the size of a small dog and can be found anywhere in the world, with the
       exception of extremely cold climates. Usually solitary, locusts only pose a great threat when a
       swarm comes together and moves through an area.

       The hind legs allow the locust to leap a number of metres equal to its DEX x5 laterally and DEX
       x2 vertically. Powerful mandibles slice easily through most kinds of vegetation and the giant
       variety is able to feed on tree foliage and bark meaning that a giant locust swarm can devastate
       forested areas in the same way its smaller cousins destroy croplands.

         Mosquito, Giant
         Blood-sucking insects that inhabit woodlands, marshlands and bogs, giant mosquitoes breed
         wherever there is standing water and are attracted by carbon dioxide – the exhaled breath of
         breathing creatures. Mosquitoes are, in general, nectar feeders and only the females require blood
         to stimulate egg production. However the giant variety, unable to gain enough sustenance from
         the small amounts of nectar normal sized plants produce, compared to the giant mosquitoes’
         size, have adapted to rely on blood.

         Giant mosquitoes are the size of a cat and the high pitched buzzing of their wings provides an
         early warning of an attack. They are most active at dawn and dusk, preferring to lie dormant
         during the day – but they will attack if disturbed. A single giant mosquito can drink a number of
         Hit Points’ worth of blood equal to its SIZ x2 before being satiated. However, it is not necessarily
         blood loss that is the killer. To drain blood the mosquito injects anti-coagulant saliva into its
         prey, and, at the levels a giant mosquito uses, this can overwhelm a bite victim after the mosquito
         has taken it fill. See Combat Notes for more details.

         On a successful attack the mosquito drains blood every Combat Action that it remains attached
         to the victim, beginning on the same CA it makes its first attack. It does not need to make
         any attack roll to continue draining blood and it will not actively defend; however if swatted
         or attacked in an attempt to remove it, it is allowed an Athletics roll to remain attached and
         continue draining blood. This costs it a Combat Action.

       Praying Mantis, Giant
       This enormous insect predator dwells in jungle and rainforest. It has long, stilt-like legs, a
       triangular head with sharp jaws and huge, observant, compound eyes and jagged forelegs. The
       head is capable of swivelling through 300 degrees, ensuring that nothing escapes its attention.
       Mantises are coloured to blend in remarkably well with their native forest environment.

       Praying mantises are strictly carnivorous creatures that feed on anything smaller than themselves.
       They are expert hunters, remaining motionless for hours on end waiting for the precise moment
       to strike. When that moment arrives, the mantis explodes forward with its forelegs to seize
       its prey. They can be tamed if taken as young and make extremely effective mounts in battle.
       Anyone riding such a creature into battle may use 1D10+10 to determine Hit Location on
       his targets, even against mounted foes (except particularly tall enemies or enemies also riding
       mantises).

       Combat Notes
       The preying mantis is a formidable hunter. Its primary attack is always the foreclaws and it
       combines both claws in a single, devastating grasp that both damages and automatically Grips
       the prey – it does not need to gain a level of success above a defender to use this Combat
       Manoeuvre. Once grasping the mantis does not inflict any further damage with the claws and
       uses its powerful mandibles to continue its attacks. The mandibles are capable of slicing through
       armour and thus it can use the Sunder Combat Manoeuvre.

         Scorpion, Giant
         Scorpions are giant carnivorous arachnids that come in a riot of colours and patterns. They live
         in jungles and deserts where they hide out during the day and emerge at nightfall to hunt. With
         pincers to the fore and a long, segmented tail carrying a wicked sting to the aft, giant scorpions
         are terrifying predators.

         The giant scorpion described below is approximately two and a half metres long, not counting the tail,
         which is itself another two metres in length. The scorpion stands about half a metre tall. Scorpions
         have no discernible head; the sensory organs are contained within the forefront of the thorax.

         Combat Notes
         Scorpion venom has the following Characteristics:
         Application: Injected or smeared.
         Onset Time: 1D3 Rounds.
         Duration: 1D3 Days.
         Resistance Time: Daily. The first Resistance roll must be made at the end of the Onset Time,
         then daily thereafter. Successfully resisting the poison allows the victim to avoid suffering the
         Conditions until the next roll must be made.
         Potency: 40+ CON of Scorpion.
         Resistance: Resilience.
         Conditions: Agony and Nausea.
         Antidote/Cure: Healing skill and magic.

       Slug, Giant
       These huge gastropods are omnivorous but are carrion feeders rather than hunters. Slow moving
       and dull-witted, giant slugs are, nevertheless, fond of fresh meat, being attracted to helpless,
       wounded creatures. Healthy sources of protein are able to move far faster than a slug and so it
       poses little threat.

       The mucus a slug exudes to help it move is extremely slippery but is otherwise harmless to the
       touch.

         Spider, Giant
         There are tens of thousands of species of spiders in the world but only a few species that pose a
         real danger to the average adventurer – the giant spider is one of these.

         The giant spider featured here is a web-spinning spider, which hunts by spreading its webs over
         an area where potential prey is likely to cross. When a creature wanders beneath the web, the
         spider rushes over and begins spewing webbing all over its intended victim.

         Another technique the spider may use is to set its web above a trail, closing it off with a net
         of webbing. When potential prey comes down the road, it is blocked by the webbing and the
         spider can then drop a sheet of webbing atop its intended victim. Still another tactic is to silently
         enclose an area in which its prey is sleeping.

         The webbing of a giant spider will hold fast anyone who touches it unless they can succeed on an
         opposed Brawn or Athletics test. The spider web’s Athletics value is equal to that of the spider that
         wove it. The web’s Hit Points are double the spider’s STR. Any weapon striking a strand of webbing
         will do damage but it also may become stuck. Flaming weapons never become stuck and always
         inflict double damage on webbing. However, webbing will not ignite.

         The web spun in a round covers an area two metres by two metres, entangling the creature within
         that space. Those stuck in this manner are effectively immobilised and cannot attack, parry, dodge
         or dive for cover until they break free of the web successfully. The trapped character may be aided by
         his companions. If the spider throws multiple webs on the same individual, each layer of webbing
         must be broken through individually. An incoming webbing attack may not be parried.

         Giant spiders are extremely intelligent creatures, though they are still just animals and their INT
         is fixed. In the following entries, the Movement figure following the slash is for movement within
         the spider’s own web.

         Combat Notes
         Spider venom has the following Characteristics:

         Application: Injected.
         Onset time: 1D3 Rounds.
         Duration: 1D3 Days.
         Resistance Time: Daily. The first Resistance roll must be made at the end of the Onset Time,
         then daily thereafter. Successfully resisting the poison allows the victim to avoid suffering the
         Conditions until the next roll must be made.
         Potency: 40+ CON of Spider.
         Resistance: Resilience.
         Conditions: Paralysis.
         Antidote/Cure: Healing skill and magic.

         The web is incredibly strong. All webs have 4 AP but the strength of the web in Hit Points
         is equal to the spider’s own STR. Those caught in the web suffer the effects of the Entangle
         Combat Manoeuvre, across 1D3 separate locations at the same time. If a victim is able to move
         across the web, his movement is reduced by two thirds.

       of drinking water. Although alligators and crocodiles are different species and have a different
       appearance (alligators are shorter and have a smaller snout), the same statistics can be used.

       Though they are often found in large numbers, crocodiles are not sociable or pack animals.
       Crocodiles are faster in the water than they are on land and prefer to attack prey in the water or
       at the water’s edge.

       When a crocodile in the water bites its victim, it holds on and spins around, attempting to
       tear away a large chunk of flesh. This attack is automatically successful (assuming of course the
       crocodile succeeds on the initial attack) and inflicts damage equal to the crocodile’s Damage
       Modifier each round to the location bitten. Armour does not protect against this damage. A
       crocodile on land is unable to use this attack, though it can still bite.

       Allosaurus
       The name means ‘different lizard’ and allosaurs are large carnivorous dinosaurs, reaching 10
       metres in length and standing over three metres tall. Allosaurs are bipedal, with large heads,
       long tails for balance and thick hides capable of easily turning aside a sword blow. They possess
       exceptional eyesight for hunting and chasing prey. As dinosaurs go, allosaurs are reasonably smart
       and, in their native terrain, are ambush predators, either exploding from cover or leaping down
       from a height, using their enormous upper jaws as a hatchet.

       Allosaurs can be found in savannahs and sparse tropical forests. They may be solitary or they may
       hunt in small packs, depending upon the area and the density of available prey.

         Ankylosaurus
         An ankylosaurus is a squat, quadruped herbivore. It has a wide shell of thick armour plates
         covering much of its turtle-like body, four thick legs and a blunt snout. The most impressive
         aspect of the dinosaur, however, is its tail, a long, muscular appendage that ends in a cruel club
         of bone. The surface and edges of the ankylosaurus’s shell is studded with bony spikes.

         Ankylosaurs are solitary creatures who only come together to mate. They prefer grassy plains
         with easy access to rivers and streams.

       Brontosaurus
       Meaning ‘thunder lizard’, and more correctly known as Apatosaurus, brontosaurs are amongst
       the largest of the dinosaurs. A brontosaurus has a tiny head at the end of a long, sweeping neck,
       elephantine body and a long tail. Generally found in herds, brontosaurs are not aggressive and
       will often ignore a creature as tiny as a human (though they may still step on the careless).

       Brontosaurs live near warm forests, and may be found either wallowing in shallow lakes and
       rivers or making their way across dry land. They are purely vegetarians, and are commonly
       around 20 metres long and four or five metres wide.

         Hadrosaurus
         Hadrosaurus is the general name given to several dozen varieties of herbivorous, bipedal dinosaurs
         commonly referred to as ‘duck-billed dinosaurs’. Varying slightly in size and body proportion,
         many of these dinosaurs have a large, bony crest atop their heads, which are used for trumpeting
         out mating calls that can carry for many kilometres.

         Hadrosaurs prefer marshy areas and riverbanks, and are almost always found along the edge of a body
         of water. They commonly congregate in herds of as many as a hundred individuals of both sexes. The

       Plesiosaurus
       A long-necked, sea-going dinosaur, plesiosaurs hunt fish and squid in the shallows although with
       its powerful flippers and tail it is quite capable of diving to great depths in search of larger prey.

       Plesiosaurs can be dangerous to lone sailors by picking them off the decks of ships, though the
       beasts will usually not attempt this unless sick or starving. When a plesiosaur rears up from
       the water like this, only its Head/Neck Hit Location can be struck – the rest remains safely
       submerged.

       Combat Notes
       Plesiosaurs are capable of seizing smaller creatures in their long, powerful jaws, and thus use
       the Grip Combat Manoeuvre before exercising a bite.

         Pteranodon
         Flying reptiles, with wingspans averaging 10 to 12 metres, pteranodons have slender bodies,
         wide wings with a grasping claw at the midpoint of each and large talons. The pteranodon’s head
         has an elongated, toothless beak, with a narrow crest almost as long as its jaw jutting from the
         rear of its skull.

         Pteranodons subsist primarily on a diet of fish and small mammals. Humans and similar creatures
         are too large for them to eat, thus, such creatures are generally ignored unless they threaten a
         pteranodon nest. Pteranodon are usually found in small colonies of 3D6 individuals.

         A pteranodon is capable of running along the ground on all fours, using its feet and the claws on
         its wings to propel itself at a speed belying its size.

       Rock Lizard
       Rock lizards are large, fairly stupid beasts that live in hills and caves, though they are also often
       found in ruined cities and other places abandoned by humanity.

       Rock lizards are carnivorous creatures who prefer live prey, but are not adverse to dining on
       carrion if that is what is available. Rock lizards typically live in colonies of as many as 50
       individuals, who can be seen basking in the sun together each morning.

         Snake
         Snakes are scaly, limbless reptiles found in nearly every non-arctic climate. There is a wide variety
         of different species within the group, each with its own specialisation. However, snakes can be
         generally divided into constricting snakes and venomous snakes. For Legend’s purposes, these
         two divisions are called simply ‘constrictors’ and ‘venomous’.


         Constrictor
         The statistics given are for an eight-metre constrictor, an enormous beast capable of consuming
         a full-grown human.

         Combat Notes
         If the constrictor’s constrict attack hits, the victim is caught up in the serpent’s coils. Each round,
         the constrictor inflicts damage to the victim’s chest location. Chest armour protects against this
         damage. In addition to the Hit Point damage caused by the constriction, the victim is unable to
         breathe and begins to suffocate (see the Legend Core Rulebook). Being constricted by a constrictor
         counts as ‘heavy’ activity in determining how long the victim can hold its breath. The victim may
         make an opposed Athletics or Brawn roll each round to escape.

       Venomous
       The statistics given below are for one of the more famous varieties of venomous snake – the
       cobra. Other venomous types can be created by varying the STR and SIZ Characteristics, as well
       as the Potency of the snake’s poison. Some snakes spit their venom, and so the Combat Style
       reflects this kind of serpent.

       Combat Notes
       Snake venom has the following Characteristics:

       Application: Injection/Smeared.
       Onset time: Nausea after 1D3 minutes, Paralysis after 3D6 minutes, Asphyxiation at conclusion.
       Duration: 1 hour.
       Resistance Time: The victim must make a Resistance roll at the Onset Time of each stage of the
       poison. Failure indicates that Condition has taken effect.
       Potency: Snake’s CON x8.
       Resistance: Resilience.
       Conditions: Nausea, Paralysis, Asphyxiation. The venom initially causes the victim to start
       feeling nauseous if the first Resistance roll is failed. The location bitten then suffers paralysis if
       the second Resistance roll is failed. At the end of the Duration the victim must succeed in a final
       resistance roll or suffer respiratory failure.
       Antidote/Cure: Anti-venom. Some cultures have perfected anti-venom remedies which have a Potency
       of 1D20+10. The anti-venom must be introduced with a successful First Aid or Healing roll and add
       their Potency as a bonus to the victim’s Resilience roll to fight the venom throughout its duration.

         Stegosaurus
         With a slender head, fat, stocky body and long, tapered tail, stegosaurs are a highly distinctive
         animal. The head and tail of the beast hang low to the ground, while its back arches up as high
         as four metres, a series of bony plates protruding from the creature’s spine, offering it protection
         against predators. The tip of its tail is equipped with four, long, vicious spikes.

         Stegosaurs prefer warm forests, and are usually found in family groups of 2D4 individuals. They
         will tend to ignore any creature that is not an obvious threat to them or their young.

       Triceratops
       A broad, muscular dinosaur with a large shield of bone surrounding its head, two long horns
       emerging from the crest and a third, smaller horn protruding from the dinosaur’s snout.

       A triceratops is a herbivore, although it has a surly and often unpleasant disposition making it
       likely to charge anything that enters its territory: if the beast fails a Persistence roll, then a charge
       is guaranteed. Triceratops are quadrupeds, propelling themselves on four thick, powerful legs.
       They are fond of open savannah and are usually solitary.

       Combat Notes
       Triceratops attempt to gore their foes. The triumvirate of horns are capable of both Sundering
       and Impaling and, if a foe is Impaled, the next Combat Action sees the triceratops aim to throw
       its victim with a toss of its massive head.

         Tyrannosaurus
         Needing little introduction, the Tyrannosaur is a consummate predator, a massive tower of
         muscle and teeth with a voracious appetite.

         Tyrannosaurs appear much like larger, stouter versions of allosaurs; they are bipedal, with large
         heads, long tails for balance and thick hides capable of easily turning aside a sword blow. They
         possess exceptional eyesight for hunting and chasing prey.

       Velociraptor
       Again needing little introduction, this is a pack-hunting dinosaur, and what the velociraptor
       lacks in size it makes up for in ferocity and a base cunning. Reasonably intelligent – at least when
       compared to other dinosaurs – the velociraptor employs misdirection and ambush techniques to
       overwhelm its prey, with members of the pack attacking from the side and rear.

       Velociraptors are capable of hunting in terrain ranging from jungle to open savannah, and
       are commonly found in packs of 3 to 12 (3D4) individuals. They are bipedal dinosaurs, with
       dextrous foreclaws, mouths full of sharp teeth and enormous claws on their powerful legs. They
       stand a little taller than a man.

       The velociraptor’s bite is capable of Bleed and Impaling. The Kick and Foreclaw are both capable
       of Sundering and Bleed, owing to the razor-like talons on each. The kick and claws are used as
       primary methods of disabling prey before the bite is used to tear the victim asunder.

       Amphisboena
       A solitary, massive serpent with a head at either end of its body, amphisboena lurk on the fringes
       of forbidding forests or in ancient, crumbling ruins.

       An amphisboena is capable of fast movement by taking one of its heads into the mouth of the
       other and rolling across the ground like a large, scaly hoop. Its bite is deadly poison, and it will
       gladly attack anything that intrudes on its territory.

       Numbers divided by a slash in the Characteristics below indicate the amphisboena actually has two such
       Characteristic scores – one for each head. All resistible attack spells targeted at an amphisboena must
       overcome both heads separately in order to take effect on the monster. This means the amphisboena is
       able to attempt to resist all incoming spells twice. Only if both heads are overcome will the spell work.
       Emotional and mental spells, such as Befuddle, or spells affecting the snake’s INT, POW or Magic
       Points, may only affect one head, chosen by the caster. The remaining head is unaffected.

       Combat Notes
       Amphisboena venom has the following Characteristics:
       Application: Injection.
       Onset time: 2 Combat Rounds.
       Duration: 6D10 minutes.
       Resistance Time: The victim must make a Resistance roll at the Onset Time of each stage of the
       poison. Failure indicates that Condition has taken effect.
       Potency: 28.
       Resistance: Resilience.
       Conditions: Agony, Exhaustion.

       Basilisk
       Approximately the size of a large rooster, a basilisk has grey or green scales, two bat-like wings
       and a mane of greasy, mangy black feathers running down its spine. It supports itself on four legs
       ending in rooster-like claws. The creature’s head is similar to a rooster’s, featuring a crown-like
       crest and a wattle. The tail is serpentine or reptilian and the facial features of the beast may also
       bear a resemblance to a lizard or snake.

       A basilisk can kill with a glance. In combat, the basilisk glares at a single opponent each
       round. If the basilisk overcomes the target in an opposed test of its Persistence against the
       target’s Resilience, the target dies instantly. Using the gaze attack costs no Magic Points and
       the basilisk may attack normally in any round in which it uses the gaze attack. This attack
       penetrates magical defences as if it were a Magnitude 6 Common Magic spell. If the target
       successfully resists the gaze attack, he is unharmed, though he may certainly be targeted
       again. The basilisk is also susceptible to its own gaze. If forced to stare into a mirror, it must
       make a successful Resilience roll of its own or die. The quality of the mirror is crucial: a true
       mirror always works as just described. A polished shield or other reflective surface will work
       too but the basilisk gains a bonus to its Resilience roll, ranging from +10 to +40 depending
       on the quality of the reflective surface.

       Any weapon hitting the basilisk corrodes in the creature’s blood, taking one point of damage
       for every point of damage inflicted on the basilisk. This damage bypasses the weapon’s Armour
       Points and is applied directly to the weapon’s Hit Points. However, magical damage from
       spells or enchantments placed on the weapon does not count as damage mirrored against the
       weapon. For example, a sword with a Bladesharp 4 spell placed upon it will inflict four points
       of additional damage to the basilisk but those four points will not in turn be applied to the
       damage suffered by the sword.

       The basilisk’s poison and corrosive blood are magical effects, which lose their special properties
       1D3 minutes after leaving the basilisk’s body, making it virtually impossible to use the creature
       as a source for such lethal compounds.

       Behemoth
       Perhaps the largest animal ever to tread upon the face of the land, a behemoth is dull-witted
       brute so powerful even a dragon would prefer to stay out of its way.

       Built much like a bear, an adult behemoth stands more than 10 metres tall at the shoulder, 10
       metres broad across the middle and is around 30 metres in length. It has smooth grey skin,
       legs like massive tree trunks and a long, thick tail ending in a knobbed and spiked club. The
       behemoth’s muscles audibly grate against one another as the beast smashes its way through the
       jungles where it makes its home, a signal every other creature takes as its cue to go far away.

       Behemoths are mammals that live in tropical jungles and are strictly herbivorous. They are
       solitary creatures that can often be found wallowing in deep pools and rivers.

       Because of a behemoth’s immense size and length, creatures less than one-third its SIZ do not roll
       on its Hit Location chart for combat attacks; they simply hit the part closest to them.

         Centaur
         Famed nomads, musicians and bowmen, centaurs are an intelligent and usually benign race.
         A centaur has the body of a horse but with the torso, arms and head of a human where the
         horse’s head would be.

         Because of a centaur’s unique body structure it is not able to put the full force of its mass behind
         most attacks. Thus, instead of adding SIZ to STR to determine the centaur’s Damage Modifier,
         the centaur’s STR should be doubled. However, if the centaur is kicking, charging or striking
         with a lance or longspear the Damage Modifier should be figured normally (STR + SIZ).

         Centaurs can be used as Adventurers. They prefer the simple life of the herd and wilds to cities
         but they are not averse to socialising with other cultures.

       Dragon
       Vast, intelligent and awe-inspiring, dragons are enormous flying reptiles that can breathe
       flame. The statistics given here relate to the traditional western dragon of legend but many
       varieties exist. Dragons tend to be solitary creatures but all are equipped with claws, fangs,
       astoundingly long life spans and a surfeit of magic. Where magic is concerned, dragons
       typically have a selection of Common Magic spells at their disposal. The statistics here give an
       example of the sorts of spells a dragon has but different individuals may well have more. As
       intelligent beings, dragons can also work sorcery.

       Combat Notes
       Dragons are highly intelligent and cunning. They have a myriad of combat options open to them
       including their breath weapon and whatever magic the dragon has learned during its long life.
       Thus, the array of combat techniques is as wide and versatile as any human foe. Depending on its
       nature, the dragon may aim to end any confrontation quickly, using its most devastating attacks
       first or toy with its foes, using magic to harass and claw swipes to injure – but not kill – thereby
       asserting supremacy. Other dragons may want to avoid a fight altogether, knowing that they
       would easily win and only something as powerful as itself poses any kind of challenge.

       Gargoyle
       With skin that emulates the texture of stone – and its hardness, to some degree – twisted faces,
       vestigial wings and grotesque postures, gargoyles are living versions of the sculpted wards that
       grace temples and cathedrals. They are not made from stone at all; and it is possible that the
       original sculptors of gargoyles based their designs on these creatures – or that the gargoyles
       were originally a race of shapechangers who were ‘inspired’ by stone gargoyles and simply took
       on a fixed form.

       Gargoyles frequent ruins and old buildings where they can merge with their surroundings
       perfectly. Their stone-like skin has a certain chameleon-like property allowing their pigmentation
       to pick-up local nuances. Some gargoyles have clumps of moss-like hair growing about their
       bodies, improving further their camouflage.

       Sinister and patient predators, a gargoyle can remain motionless for hours on end, waiting for
       the right moment to strike. When they do so, they have lightning reactions, bursting forth
       from their hiding places in a flurry of claws and talons. At other times they move slowly and
       imperceptibly, tiny shifts in position at a time that can only be detected with a critical Perception
       roll, allowing the gargoyle to creep-up on an unwary foe and maximise its surprise.

       Ghoul
       Ghouls are demonic creatures that sustain their unnatural existence by feeding on the corpses
       of the dead. Formed when a malign spirit crosses over from the nether world to possess a freshly
       slain corpse, most ghouls come in human form but there is nothing to prevent such a spirit from
       inhabiting any newly killed body. The spirits that become ghouls are the hungry, emaciated
       spirits that are drawn to graveyards or places of death; anyone capable of Spirit Combat can see
       such spirits clamouring around places where the dead are interred (or left to rot) – and identify
       bodies possessed by the ghoul spirit. Shamans with the capability can attempt to discorporate the
       ghoul spirit and battle it on the Spirit Plane, where the ghoul’s claws become Spectral Weapons
       at the same percentage as their mundane weapons.

       Ghouls look like grotesque caricatures of humanity, rotting corpses from a week-old grave. Any
       armour they possess is looted from graves and victims and they usually eschew weapons, preferring to
       do battle with their talons and poisonous bite.

       Combat Notes
       Ghouls employ a blood chilling howl in combat. When a ghoul
       howls, every creature in a radius equal to the ghoul’s POW in
       metres becomes Demoralised (as the Common Magic spell)
       unless he can overcome the ghoul’s Persistence with his
       Resilience in an opposed test. The Demoralise effect
       continues until all howling stops. Any who are able to resist
       the howling must resist again every round for a total of
       five successive rounds, after which they are considered
       immune to the howling’s effects for a week.

       Countermagic, Shield and Spell Resistance offer
       no protection against the effects of a ghoul’s howl.

       The bite of a ghoul is venomous, with the
       following Characteristics:

       Application: Injection.
       Onset time: 1D3 Combat Rounds.
       Duration: 1D10 Hours.
       Resistance Time: The victim must make a
       Resistance roll at the end of the Onset Time.
       Failure indicates that Condition has taken
       effect.
       Potency: 22.
       Resistance: Resilience.
       Conditions: Paralysis.
       Antidote/Cure: Healing Magic only.

       Gorgon
       Monsters of legend who posess the upper bodies of women but the lower body of giant snakes.
       Their heads are wreathed in serpents instead of hair. The monster’s face can shift into something
       so hideous that anyone who sees it is automatically and immediately turned to stone, the victim’s
       spirit trapped helpless inside the statue. This is a passive gaze attack.

       Whilst gorgons are often solitary creatures, residing far from human sight, they do socialise with
       their own kind, forming small groups of 2D3 entities. Every gorgon has a percentage chance equal
       to its POW of being immortal and of having an additional Chaos Feature. Immortal gorgons can
       only be affected by magical damage. They can also possess Common and Divine magic.

       Combat Notes
       The gorgon’s appearance attack is line of sight but the victim must be able to see the face – the attack
       will not work in pitch darkness or fog, for example. The attack is not hindered by defensive spells such
       as Countermagic. Gorgons are immune to their own appearance and that of other gorgons.

       The gorgon’s gaze attack is an automatic attack at the beginning of every round. Every
       susceptible creature must make an opposed Resilience test against the Gorgon’s Persistence or
       be turned to stone.

       The mane of snakes that forms a gorgon’s hair is a different threat altogether. If the gaze attack
       does not work and if the gorgon can connect with a claw attack, it Grips the opponent and draws
       them in for the hideous, writhing snakes to do their work. 1D4+1 snakes can make a single
       attack as a Combat Action, with each snake inflicting its own damage if the single attack hits.
       The poison is the same as for Venomous Snake (see page 105) with the Venom Potency being
       equal to the gorgon’s CON x3

       Harpy
       A notoriously filthy and evil race, harpies appear as human-sized grimy vultures with the head
       and upper torso of a human female. Harpies delight in befouling the person and possessions of
       others, being things of mischief and villainy rather than outright killers.

       Harpies are prone to acts of petty cruelty. They enjoy contaminating food stocks with their dung
       – rendering it disease-ridden and inedible except to harpies. They are also fond of stealing small
       items of value. If an Adventurer gains the enmity of a harpy (easily done), it will follow them for
       miles, albeit at a safe distance, indulging itself in whatever torments it can devise.

       Combat Notes
       Harpies often fight by dropping stones on their foes. These stones are between 5 and 10 kilograms
       and inflict 1D6 damage for every three metres the stone falls (to a maximum of 10D6). The
       harpy’s chance to hit decreases by 5% per three metres of distance the stone falls.

       Lamia
       This beautiful and deadly creature is wholly supernatural and wholly evil. A lamia resembles a
       beautiful woman from the torso up but has the lower body of an enormous serpent.

       As a Combat Action, a lamia is able to project an illusion that covers her lower half and makes
       her look like a human woman. The illusion contains visual components only – while it may look
       like the lamia has legs, anyone brave enough to touch her will feel the hard, cold scales of her
       serpent half, rather than a pair of shapely legs. This illusion lasts as long as the lamia wishes and
       costs her two Magic Points per day to maintain. Her chance to create the illusion is 100%. This
       illusion can be dispelled as though it were a Magnitude 4 spell.

       Each Combat Round, as a Combat Action, a lamia may make a gaze attack to try to overcome
       a male humanoid (including humans, dwarfs, elves, trolls & halflings) in an opposed test of her
       Seduction against the male’s Resilience. If the lamia wins, the man immediately falls hopelessly
       in love with her for as long as she is present. The first time he sees her in her true form, rather
       than cloaked in an illusion, he may attempt to break her hold by making another opposed test. If
       he succeeds, he breaks free but if he fails, he remains entranced as long as he is in her presence. If
       an Adventurer is able to resist the lamia’s gaze attack, he will be immune to it for a full 24 hours.

       A man in thrall to a lamia will do virtually anything she asks, including attacking friends and
       comrades.

       Manticore
       A manticore is a large, leonine creature with the tail of a scorpion and the head of a man. The
       tip of the tail boasts several dozen long, sharp spines and the creature’s face is round and hideous,
       sporting a pair of long tusks and a scraggly mane like a lion’s.

       A bestial, dangerous creature, the manticore is usually a solitary predator, haunting wastelands
       and remote mountain regions. It is a well-known eater of human flesh.

       Combat Notes
       The tail injects venom with the following Characteristics:

       Application: Injected.
       Onset time: 1D3 Rounds.
       Duration: 1D3 Days.
       Resistance Time: Daily. The first Resistance roll must be made at the end of the Onset Time,
       then daily thereafter. Successfully resisting the poison allows the victim to avoid suffering the
       Conditions until the next roll must be made.
       Potency: 30+ CON of Manticore.
       Resistance: Resilience.
       Conditions: Agony and Paralysis.
       Antidote/Cure: Healing skill and magic.

         Minotaur
         The bull/man hybrid of legend, minotaurs have a reputation for violence and, to outsiders, they
         are surly and often down-right aggressive; but these are not simple-minded monsters; they are
         intelligent and capable of quite rational behaviour – although their dispositions remain gruff,
         at best.

         Minotaurs are omnivorous and stories abound of them dining on human flesh but such tales are
         rarely true. Minotaurs tend to embrace a philosophy of avoiding humans, rather than confronting
         them and for straight-dealings when they have to discourse with human society.

         Minotaur settlements tend to be found in remote valleys, away from civilisation. Minotaur
         females are far more docile than the men, fulfilling the child-caring and hearth-tending role
         whilst the males farm and hunt.

       Mummy
       A mummy is an undead monster spawned of a preserved, desiccated and eviscerated corpse,
       inhabited by the spirit or soul that resided in the creature when it was alive. The spirit is
       effectively captured within the emaciate frame of the mummy but the physical and the spiritual
       are no longer the single, harmonious unit they were in life. The body has become a prison and
       even though it is rotten and fragile, it still, nevertheless, prevents the spirit from going where it
       intends to. The spirit is therefore an insane version of what existed in life, bent, very often, on
       extracting revenge from the living – and those who created its torment in particular.

       A mummy’s body is dried, spiced and wrapped in dry cloth, making it particularly vulnerable to
       fire. An Ignite spell will work on any portion of a mummy’s body. A strike with a fiery weapon,
       such as a sword with a Fireblade spell on it or even a torch, will ignite the Hit Location struck if
       the damage from the fire overcomes the mummy’s Resilience in a standard opposed test.

       Mummies can be engaged in Spirit Combat on the mundane plane with no discorporation
       necessary. In Spirit Combat the mummy attacks with its Spectral Grip – the same as for its
       mundane grip but with damage applied as per the Spirit Combat rules from Legend.

       When a creature becomes a mummy, its STR and CON are doubled. The statistics represent a human
       mummy, though any sentient creature willing to undergo the process may become a mummy.

       by the mummy’s new Characteristics.

       Common Magic: Mummies also have any Common Magic spells they had when living. However,
       because the harmony between spirit and flesh is broken, the Magic Point cost is doubled.

       Roc
       A roc is an enormous bird of prey, larger than a dragon and fully capable of challenging one for
       rulership of the air. Capable of feeding on elephants with ease, a roc will usually ignore a creature
       as small as a human but will certainly attempt to destroy humans or any other predators found
       near its nest.

       Rocs are capable of attacking a ship by dropping enormous stones onto the deck, often punching
       a hole straight through the hull. A typical roc has a wingspan of approximately 40 metres and a
       body length of 18 to 20 metres.

       Satyr
       Satyrs are magical and mischievous woodland creatures with a reputation for lechery (amongst
       woodland spirits) and a beguiling way. All satyrs are male and must perpetuate their race by
       breeding with nymphs or with captured human or elven women – a proclivity which has caused
       satyrs to be avidly hunted in most human and elven lands.

       Satyrs have the haunches and legs of goats, with a human torso and head above. Their hair is
       thick and curly and is usually pierced by a pair of short, goat-like horns. Satyrs are famed for their
       uncanny strength and stamina.

       Satyrs are avid practitioners of Common Magic and tend to use their pipes (or, rarely, another
       instrument) as a focus. A satyr’s skill with his pipes activates his Common Magic skill. By playing the
       pipes and expending the appropriate number of Magic Points, a satyr can cast any spell he knows.

       A satyr’s magic is unlike most Common Magic in that the spells will affect anyone within
       earshot of the pipes, to a maximum number of targets equal to the satyr’s POW. The satyr may
       consciously choose to exempt one or more particular individuals. This aspect of satyr magic is
       tied directly to the creature’s magical biology and no satyr can teach a non-satyr how to cast spells
       in this manner. In addition to its more normal spells, a satyr can make use of three spells unique
       to the satyr race.

       Harmonise
       Duration Special, Magnitude 2, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

       This spell causes all who hear it and fail to resist to dance and sing as long as the satyr continues
       to play his pipes. Victims of this spell dance to the exclusion of all other actions, though they
       may make a second attempt to resist the spell if they suffer damage (the loss of one or more Hit
       Points) at any time during the spell.

       Madness
       Duration Special, Magnitude 4, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

       This spell causes all who fail to resist it to either begin screaming in horror or singing merrily
       (50% chance of either). The victim will not react to outside stimuli, even if wounded while
       under the influence of the spell.

       Sleep
       Duration Special, Magnitude 3, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

       Sleep causes all who fail to resist its effects to fall immediately into a deep, but normal, sleep.
       Sleeping Adventurers may be woken by loud noises, nudging and so forth.

       Skeleton
       A skeleton is a magical construct that is animate only until the magic powering it runs out or the
       skeleton is destroyed. A skeleton has no mind of its own – it only follows the commands of its
       creator as literally and completely as possible.

       Skeletons have a score of 0 for INT, POW and CHA, as they have no intelligence, will or
       personalities of their own. As such, attempts to control a skeleton’s mind or influence its
       personality will automatically fail. Skeletons are also immune to fatigue, disease, poisons and
       weapons that only cause impaling hits.

       Most skeletons are the dead remains of humans or humanoids but it is entirely possible to encounter
       a skeleton formed from the remains of any creature with a bone structure. A skeleton has the same
       Movement the creature had in life but as a skeleton it cannot naturally fly or swim (if the creature
       had those abilities while alive).

         Unicorn
         A potent creature of legend, unicorns need little introduction. Generally they are smaller than a
         horse but are distinguished by their cloven hooves (rather than a single, full hoof ) and the long,
         spiralling horn mounted in the centre of their foreheads.

         Extremely intelligent, unicorns are solitary, forest-dwelling creatures. They are immortal and have
         a natural affinity with forest-tied creatures such as elves, forest spirits, satyrs and so on. They are
         attuned to purity: of body and spirit. Any Adventurer that can demonstrate purity in both these
         ways (and it is not an easy thing to do) will find that the unicorn acts with friendliness towards
         them.

         The unicorn’s horn is a powerful source of magical healing. It acts as a Cure Disease/Poison spell
         and will cure magical diseases and poisons with a potency less than the unicorn’s Persistence.
         The horn also acts as a Heal Body spell with a Magnitude of 1D6 and Heal Mind. However, the
         magic only works if the unicorn offers the healing willingly. Forcing a unicorn to use its magic
         or cutting off the horn in the hope of gaining a permanent healing implement renders the magic
         useless.

       creature can become a vampire, though they are most often humans before they are Turned.

       As supernatural predators without equal, vampires are incredibly strong and resilient to harm.
       When becoming a vampire, an Adventurers STR and DEX scores both double and he gains
       limited natural armour in the form of his hardened skin. Vampires also possess the traits Night
       Sight and Life Sense. Coupled with near-immortality and several further benefits of the vampiric
       form described, it is easy to see why this state of undeath holds such a macabre appeal.

       Vampires can only gain sustenance by drinking the blood or souls of living beings. To feed
       from a resisting victim, a vampire must somehow restrain the victim and somehow succeed in a
       subsequent bite attack. The bite attack drains either blood, in the form of CON, or the soul, in
       the form of POW. The damage from the bite is applied to one of these Characteristics directly,
       rather than to Hit Points. The amount of CON or POW sapped is added to the vampire’s own
       CON or POW; thus, the more a vampire feeds, the stronger it becomes. A human vampire
       can drain up to 21 CON or 21 POW and other species can drain up to their respective species
       maximum. However, a vampire can reach satiation without completely draining a victim of
       Characteristic points. Each round the vampire makes either a Resilience or Persistence test,
       depending on whether or not it feeds on blood or souls. If the roll succeeds, then the vampire
       continues to feed. When the roll fails, it has drunk enough and ceases.

       The amount of CON or POW drained sustains the vampire for a number of days equal to
       the number of points drunk: it need not feed again and will feel no compulsion to do so but
       may feed if it wishes, until it reaches either satiation or its consumption limit (21 or species
       maximum). The amount of characteristic points drained dissipate at the rate of 1 point every
       day: thus, the vampire’s CON or POW diminishes by one point the day after feeding but it
       will not feel compelled to feed until all the Characteristic points it has fed on have diminished.
       Furthermore, the vampire’s CON or POW will not fall below its original, living, level. Thus,
       a vampire with CON 11 could drain up to 21 points of blood in one feeding session, gaining
       a CON of 32. It will feel no compulsion to feed again for 21 days but its CON will drop by
       one point per day until it reaches 11 – at that stage, the compulsion to feed is overwhelming.

       If the vampire feeds on souls, even POW dedicated to a Pact is consumed; and, in fact, this is
       consumed first. Thus, a soul-feeding vampire can effectively break the link a victim has with a
       god – and does so deliberately to prevent interference from meddling deities.

       If an Adventurer is reduced to zero CON or POW by a vampire, either in one or several feeding
       attacks, there is a chance equal to the vampire’s original POW x3 that the victim will resurrect
       as a vampire, enthralled to the one who created them. If the POW x3 roll fails then the victim
       simply dies. If the roll succeeds, they resurrects as a vampire after a number of days equal to their
       original CON or POW subtracted from 21.

       Vampires have the ability to shapeshift into mist at will. As a single Combat Action, the vampire
       (and every non-living item on his person) dissolves into a thin, greenish fog approximately the
       same SIZ as they were in the flesh. As a mist, the vampire is immune to all types of physical
       damage but cannot take any action except Movement. In mist form, a vampire moves at the same
       speed as they would normally and is unaffected by strong winds.

       There is a chance equal to the vampire’s POW that it also has the ability to transform into a wolf or
       bat. If the roll to determine this additional ability is a critical success, then the vampire can assume the
       form of both. As with the mist transformation, such changes take a Combat Action to perform.

       Vampires retain all Common Magic and Sorcery known before their transformation. Any Divine
       Magic is lost.

         Vampire Weaknesses
         Despite their undoubted power, vampires have certain inherent weaknesses.

         •	   If a vampire is reduced to zero Hit Points in its Head or Chest Hit Locations, it dies –
              albeit not necessarily for good. Upon death, the vampire collapses to the ground and turns
              to mist at the beginning of the next Combat Round. Before then, it can be destroyed
              permanently by driving a stake through its heart (the only way to prevent it turning to mist)
              and decapitating it.
         •	   Vampires cannot stand the touch of natural sunlight. They take one point of damage to
              every Hit Location per round that they are exposed to the sun, though some will risk
              travelling in the daylight hours by wearing layers of clothing and a hood to cover as much
              of their body as possible.
         •	   The holy icons of some cults have proved effective against vampires in the past. Cults that
              focus their energies against the undead (such as those formed around Death, Law and
              Light runes or similar gods) are the most likely to be effective, though the end result is
              down to the Games Master to decide what supernaturally offends any particular vampire.
              An elven vampire, for example, might be repelled by symbols of nature gods, rather than
              human symbols of holiness. Any Adventurer presenting a holy symbol to a vampire as a
              Combat Action matches their Persistence against the vampire’s Resilience in an opposed
              check. They will receive bonuses or penalties at the Games Master’s discretion, based on the
              appropriateness of the symbol being displayed. On a successful test, the vampire loses 1D4
              Hit Points to a random Hit Location, unaffected by armour or any of the vampire’s magic.

         Werewolf
         Scholars are divided as to whether werewolves are humans who turn into wolves or wolves who turn
         into humans – a simple question no werewolf has ever bothered to answer. Whatever the truth of
         the matter, a werewolf takes on the strength and senses of a wolf at the expense of intelligence.

         Werewolves can change form at will, an act that requires two Combat Actions to complete. On
         nights of a full moon, werewolves have no choice but to assume beast form.

         The bite of a werewolf does not cause the recipient of the bite to become a werewolf, to the
         contrary of much popular belief.

         While in wolf form, werewolves are immune to most damage. Only magic, fire or weapons made
         of pure silver will harm them – all other blows simply bounce off harmlessly. If a normal sword
         with a Bladesharp 3 spell cast on it is used against a werewolf, only the three points of damage
         from the spell will affect the creature; the weapon’s normal damage, as well as the attacker’s
         Damage Modifier, do not count. The werewolf ’s thick skin, which grants the beast one point of
         armour, would reduce the Bladesharp spell’s damage to two. If the entire weapon is enchanted,
         such as with a Fireblade spell, the entire damage rolled will count, though the wielder’s Damage
         Modifier will still be ignored.

         Werewolves can be poisoned, so long as the poison can be introduced to the creature’s body.
         They are living entities who require oxygen and thus may be asphyxiated or drowned.

         The statistics are for a typical werewolf form. For human characteristics, use the standard Legend
         rules for creating an Adventurer.

       Wurm
       A wurm is a large, limbless reptile, distantly related to dragons and their kind. Wurms have
       no fiery breath weapon to employ, but they are able to belch out a cloud of poisonous gas and
       regenerate Hit Points after suffering damage.

       Wurms are found in dismal swamps and dark forests, usually far from any human habitation.
       They are fixed INT creatures, but display such a level of base cunning that many incorrectly
       believe them to be sentient. A wurm appears as a large snake, except for the head, which, while
       reptilian, sports a crest much like that of a dragon.

       The wurm can emit a cloud of poisonous gas once per round. The wurm’s poison cloud remains
       for one round before losing its effectiveness.

       A wurm regenerates two Hit Points per Combat Round in every damaged location. Regeneration
       will cease if the wurm dies.

       Combat Notes
       Wurms exhale a poisonous gas that affects everyone within a radius equal to the monster’s CON
       in metres and has the following Characteristics:

       Application: Inhaled.
       Onset time: Immediate.
       Duration: 1 Combat Round.
       Resistance Time: The victim must make a Resistance roll at the Onset Time of each stage of the
       poison. Failure indicates that Condition has taken effect.
       Potency: 72.
       Resistance: Resilience.
       Conditions: Agony. The victim suffers 1D8 points of damage to the chest location if the
       resistance test is failed.
       Antidote/Cure: Healing magic.

         Wyrm
         Wyrms are serpentine, legless, winged relatives of dragons. Possessed of intelligence akin to that
         of a human, a wyrm is a patient, dangerous foe but it lacks the superior insight and intelligence
         of a true dragon.

         Solitary hunters, it is very rare to find a group of wyrms acting in concert, though sometimes
         a few individuals will join together for a common purpose. Unlike dragons, wyrms cannot use
         magic.

         Upon hatching, a wyrm is about two metres long and has 3D6 SIZ and STR. The wyrm will grow at
         the rate of 1D6 SIZ and STR every five years until it reaches the age of 35, when the creature’s growth
         slows dramatically. By this point the creature is some nine metres in length. After age 35, a wyrm will
         continue to gain 1D6 SIZ and STR every 50 years. A wyrm may live for many hundreds of years.

         The Characteristics given below are for a wyrm between 35 and 85 years old.

       Wyvern
       A distant and less dangerous relative of the dragon, wyverns are solitary hunters the size of a
       horse. A wyvern has two legs, two wings, no forelimbs and a tail tipped with a lethal poison
       stinger, long enough to reach around the wyvern to strike an enemy in front of the creature.

       Like wyrms, their cousins, wyverns are cunning and dangerous but lack the insight and magical
       abilities of true dragons.

       Combat Notes
       The sting is the favoured weapon of the wyvern and it has the following Characteristics:

       Application: Injected or smeared.
       Onset time: Immediate.
       Duration: 1D6 Days.
       Resistance Time: Daily. The first Resistance roll must be made at the end of the Onset Time,
       then daily thereafter. Successfully resisting the poison allows the victim to avoid suffering the
       Conditions until the next roll must be made.
       Potency: 50+ CON of wyvern.
       Resistance: Resilience.
       Conditions: Agony and Paralysis.
       Antidote/Cure: Healing skill and magic.

         Zombie
         A zombie is a corpse that has been animated by dark magic. A zombie has only shreds of its original
         mind left and is generally either under the control of a master or follows its natural hunger to feed
         on living flesh. Since a zombie is comprised of rotting flesh, they sometimes carry diseases which
         can be passed on via wounds they inflict.

         Zombies have very low INT and POW, and no CHA, as they have virtually no intelligence, will or
         personalities of their own. As such, attempts to control a zombie’s mind or influence its personality
         will suffer a –50% penalty. Zombies are also immune to fatigue, disease and poisons.

         Combat Notes
         Slow and ponderous, the tenacious nature of zombies still makes them a formidable foe, especially
         in large numbers where a gang of the undead can outnumber and overwhelm a foe. The unarmed
         attack of the zombie is a flailing, grasping flurry that aims to randomly Grip or Bash with little
         strategy or reasoning. They do, however, concentrate on attacking rather than defending, so that
         single Combat Action is almost always used offensively.

         Baboon
         Baboons are omnivorous primates that subsist mostly on fruits and roots, though they do hunt
         live prey from time-to-time. They gather in groups of as many as 100 individuals, ruled over by a
         handful of dominant males (roughly 10% of the population). Baboon troops are amazingly well
         organised. No matter what the rest of the group may be doing, there are always enough sentinels
         on guard to watch for intruders. When baboons are travelling, the females and young are kept to
         the centre, closely guarded by the dominant males, while the lesser males scout ahead and guard
         the perimeter. If a baboon group encounters a superior foe, the baboons will scatter and climb
         trees or rocks for protection.

       Bear, Brown
       Bears are often unpredictable and can display vicious or cowardly behaviour on a whim. Some
       adventurers manage to scare them away from camps with bravado while others have paid a heavy
       price for this approach. Sleeping for long periods over winter, bears will occasionally forage the
       snow-bound wilderness, typically preying on cattle and deer but, being true omnivores, they are
       also opportunistic when it comes to food.

         Bear, Polar
         One of the largest and most aggressive species of bear, the polar bear lives on the frozen wastes
         and ice floes of the world’s arctic regions. It is a strictly carnivorous creature, dining primarily
         on seals and fish.

         Polar bears are excellent swimmers. They have little fear of humans and will often treat them as
         prey if they come into the bears’ territory.

       Boar
       Boars are wild, feral pigs with wiry coats, long tusks and extremely poor dispositions. They are
       commonly encountered in small groups of 2 to 12 individuals and prefer forested areas.

       Boars are omnivorous, though the majority of their diet is composed of roots and berries. They
       are ferociously territorial creatures who will attack a much larger creature without hesitation.
       They are also incredibly resilient to damage and do not need to make Resilience rolls against any
       wounds save Major Wounds.

       Chimpanzee
       Chimpanzees are forest-dwelling apes slightly smaller than humans. They are extremely intelligent
       creatures, with thin black hair and long, muscular arms. Chimpanzees are quadrupeds, though
       they can walk short distances on their hind legs and split their time equally between walking on
       the ground and swinging from the trees overhead.

       Chimpanzees are primarily herbivorous, subsisting almost entirely on fruit and leaves, though
       they can also eat meat and insects. They are found in bands of as many as 20 individuals of both
       genders led by a dominant male.

       Some male chimps will use clubs for threatening gestures and, from time to time, will even wield
       them in combat. Most chimpanzees would never use weapons, however.

         Deer
         One of the most common food sources for human civilisations, as well as a number of large
         carnivores, deer are a wary and easily frightened species. They dwell mostly on the fringes of
         forests and in brushy areas where they follow well-established feeding and migration trails. A
         deer will only attack if it has no other choice.

         Deer live in small herds, consisting of a number of does and fawns with either one dominant stag
         or a small group of bachelor stags. The statistics given are for a stag; does have SIZ 3D6+9.

       Dog
       All dogs are descended from wolves but millennia of crossbreeding and diversification has
       produced the myriad breeds (mongrel and pedigree) found across the world. Dogs are easily
       domesticated, display high degrees of loyalty and can be crossbred to a huge variety of purposes.
       The hearing and sense of smell in all dogs is incredibly acute, reflected in the Perception rating.

       Breeds of dogs come as small as STR 1D3 and SIZ 1D3 or as large as STR 2D6+3 and SIZ
       2D6+3. The statistics here are for a medium sized mongrel.

       Left to their own devices, dogs hunt in packs composed of members of both sexes, led by a single
       dominant individual.

         Elephant
         Elephants need little introduction. They usually travel in herds and live on savannahs, tropical
         plains and in lightly wooded areas. An elephant stands a little more than three metres tall and has
         a large, prehensile trunk and a pair of tusks.

         Elephants travel in herds, though these herds will sometimes break up temporarily when the
         elephants are feeding. A solitary elephant is almost certainly a rogue beast, expelled from its herd
         because of its poor temperament. If one member of a herd is sick or wounded, the remainder of
         the herd will actively protect it.

         Elephants are intelligent beasts who learn very quickly. They can be domesticated and trained
         and in some cultures are used as mounts.

         Elephants can Grip opponents with their trunk, effectively immobilising them and then
         attempting to throw them. A successful throw occurs if the victim cannot break free on the
         Combat Action following the Grip and if the elephant succeeds in a Brawn roll. The victim is
         thrown 2D6 metres and may sustain falling damage.

       Gorilla
       Largest of the primates, gorillas are naturally quadrupeds but are also comfortable walking and
       standing on their hind legs. Gorillas are primarily vegetarian, though they often supplement
       their diet with insects and the occasional small animal. They are most often found in small family
       groups led by an old silverback male.

       Gorillas are not an aggressive species but if one becomes angry, it is easily capable of tearing a
       man, or even a troll, limb from limb. Female gorillas are smaller than males and have 1D6 less
       of both SIZ and STR.

         Hawk
         Hawks are predatory birds that can be found in most climates, from tropical to temperate to
         desert. A capable hunter who prefers to fall upon its prey by dropping out of the sky, a hawk will
         not attack anything that is not normally prey unless it is diseased, magically compelled or the
         creature in question is menacing the hawk’s young.

         The statistics given below are for a large hawk but may also be applied to an owl or an eagle.
         Owls have the Night Sight trait.

         Combat Notes
         Trained birds of prey can be directed to attack larger targets than their normal prey.
         The claws and beak of a giant bird of prey can Sunder.

       Horse
       Of all domesticated animals, only dogs have been part of human culture longer than horses. As
       such, many different breeds of horse have emerged over the millennia, as humanity has bred this
       useful servant to fill a variety of specialised needs. The horse described below is a typical working
       horse, suitable for riding or as a beast of burden.

       Heavy horses – those used for ploughing fields and as warhorses – have an additional +4 STR,
       +4 CON and +4 SIZ.

         Lion
         Largest of the big cats, lions hunt in arid grasslands and live communally in packs known as
         prides.

         A pride of lions is composed of lionesses, juveniles and several adult males who act as
         leaders. The lionesses do the majority of the hunting, whilst the males act mostly to defend
         the pride. A male lion is usually easy to spot, as the majority have a dramatic mane of fur
         framing their faces.

         Combat Notes
         A lion uses its claws to Grip and hold prey and then deliver a bite on the next Combat Action.
         A similar tactic is used by lionesses when giving chase to prey; both claws pull the prey to the
         ground and it suffers falling damage as though falling from 3 metres before the lioness then
         inflicts a killing bite.

       Mammoth
       Mammoths are closely related to elephants and far less common. They are built much like
       elephants, save that they have larger heads and tusks, smaller ears and a coat of thick fur. They
       usually travel in herds and live in arctic and sub-arctic steppes. A mammoth stands a little more
       than four metres tall and has a large, prehensile trunk and a pair of tusks.

         Panther
         A panther is a large hunting cat. For this description, panther includes such diverse feline species as
         mountain lions, jaguars and leopards. These creatures live in forests and jungles, sometimes ranging
         out into nearby savannahs, plains and even deserts. They will prey on anything they can kill but
         they are wily animals and will not attack a foe with superior numbers or one that is obviously more
         than a match for them.

         Panthers hunt by lying in wait and springing on their prey from ambush.

       Rhinoceros
       Dim-witted and surly, these great beasts live on tropical savannahs and at the edges of forests.
       They have poor eyesight and a tendency to charge anything they perceive as infringing on their
       territory.

       Strictly herbivorous, rhinoceroses are nonetheless very good at defending themselves and are able
       to stand up to a much larger carnivore in a one on one fight. Though a few attempts have been
       made to domesticate them, most have failed but some cultures still actively seek rhinoceroses for
       participation in arena games and other blood sports, as well as for the reputed magical properties
       of their horns.

       Combat Notes
       The rhino horn is also a vicious impaling weapon. If a foe is Impaled, the next Combat Action
       sees the rhino aim to throw its victim with a toss of its head.

         Shark
         A perfect killing and eating machine, the shark is one of the most famous and feared denizens
         of the oceans. Sharks are unpredictable and dangerous, though fortunately, unlike sea serpents,
         they very rarely grow large enough to menace ships. They are, however, extremely hazardous to
         anyone actually in the water.

         A shark is in constant motion and is always on the lookout for prey. The skin of a shark is
         extremely tough, covered with thousands of tiny ridges.

       Tiger
       One of the largest of the big cats, a tiger hunts alone, eschewing the company of its own kind
       except during mating season. Tigers live in jungles and grassy areas and are perfectly capable of
       surviving in conditions ranging from the tropical to the arctic.

       Tigers prefer to ambush their prey and are intelligent enough to avoid obviously dangerous
       quarry.

         Tiger, Sabre Tooth (Smilodon)
         Sabre tooth tigers are not true tigers but a separate big-cat species. Stocky and powerful over
         short distances, their favoured tactic is to ambush their prey from a high point, leaping onto the
         back and stabbing down with their dreadful sabre-curved fangs. They are native to savannahs
         and bushlands, stalking rocky outcrops and grazing areas.

       Wolf
       Consummate hunters, wolves gather in groups ranging from a few individuals to packs as large as 50 or
       more. They tend to prefer mountains and forest terrain, although they can be found almost anywhere.

       Wolves fight as a group. In combat, several of them target a single enemy, raising the chances that
       one of them will be able to get through any defence. Larger wolves of the pack will often attempt
       to throw an enemy off his feet with a Leaping Attack, allowing the remainder of the pack to rush
       in while the enemy is off balance.

       Though wolves are hated by ranchers and farmers for their tendency to dine on livestock, they
       rarely attack humans.

                     Legend & Open Content
           Here at Mongoose Publishing, we want what we truly believe to be one of the best fantasy
           RPGs on the market to be easy to use and modify. We have therefore made this rulebook
                       Open Content, in conjunction with the Open Game Licence.

             All the text of this book is designated as Open Content – this means you are free to use
           the Open Game Licence (overleaf ) to reproduce this text and build upon it with your own
          scenarios and mechanics. You can even print and sell such work, if that is your desire (and we
                          would wish you the very best of luck if you choose to do this!).

          By using the Open Content of this book, you also have permission to download the Legend
         Compatible logo from our web site (on the Legend product pages), and use that on any Legend
              work you publish, to demonstrate your material is part of the wider Legend family.

                         Please note that the artwork in this book is not Open Content.

            All books in the core Legend range (those whose titles have the word ‘Legend’ in them)
           will also be designated as Open Content, allowing you to expand your own games in many
             different directions, while maintaining a solid root that everyone will be familiar with.

          For example, you might be using Legend to produce your own gaming world. If you wanted
         to add some high seas action, you can simply and quickly bring over the Open Content rules
         we produce in, say, Pirates of Legend, knowing that everyone who plays Legend will at least be
                                            familiar with those rules.
