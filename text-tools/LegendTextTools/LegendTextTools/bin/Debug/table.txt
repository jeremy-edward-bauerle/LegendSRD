| Alchemist’s Lore (Alchemy) Skill | Purity | Purity Property    | Effect |
|----------------------------------|--------|--------------------|--------|
| 01-50%                           | 1      | Healing            | For every Magic Point invested in the creation of the Stone, 1 Hit Point of damage in each location is healed immediately. The Stone can be sprinkled on, or rubbed into, a wound to provide healing, or can drunk in the form of a solution. |
| 51-100%                          | 2      | Disease Resistance | For every 3 Magic Points invested, the imbiber gains +5% to their Resilienceskill for the purposes of resisting disease. This effect is permanent, and any existing disease is immediately cured. |
| 101-150%                         | 3      | Poison Resistance  | For every 3 Magic Points invested, the imbiber gains +5% to their Resilience skill for the purposes of resisting poison. This effect is permanent, and any existing poison is immediately cured. |
| 151-250%                         | 4      | Longevity          | For every 3 Magic Points invested the imbiber gains an additional 5 years to their normal lifespan. They are not immortal and not immune to the physical damage, but the ageing process slows as their allotted span increases. |
| 251%+                            | 5      | Immortality        | For the Philosopher’s Stone to grant immortality, the alchemist must be able to invest at least 250 Magic Points. Where reserves are found and how they are stored is a problem for the alchemist to solve. Once imbibed, the Adventurer is immortal with ageing arrested. The Adventurer is still susceptible to all forms of damage, but immune to the passage of time. |
